      "title": "Newly declassified court documents reveal FBI FISA violations in targeting Americans", 
      "content": " Newly declassified court documents indicate that the\u00a0FBI failed to comply with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in targeting Americans while searching through NSA records\u00a0during President Trump's administration and after James Comey's tenure as FBI director. An October 2018 ruling\u00a0from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) found\u00a0that the FBI violated Section 702 by not keeping track of searches that pertained to \"United States persons,\" and that proposed changes were still not enough to comply with the law.\u00a0That ruling was later affirmed on appeal in July 2019. The documents were declassified and released Tuesday. FISA Section 702, which deals with targeting people outside the U.S. for gathering foreign intelligence information, places restrictions on gathering information when it comes to Americans or people located in the U.S. LINDSEY GRAHAM WARNS FISA ABUSE WILL HAPPEN AGAIN 'IF SOMEBODY'S NOT PUNISHED HERE' \u201cBecause the FBI's proposed procedures do not require it to keep records that \u2018indicate whether terms are United States person query terms,\u2019 the FISC held that these procedures do not comply with Section 702(f)(l)(B),\u201d said the decision from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISC-R), which heard the appeal. The queries examined took place between\u00a02017 and 2018, which would largely be during FBI director Chris Wray's tenure and during the Trump presidency. The FBI did not immediately return a request for comment. The FBI has argued that because they kept general records of the search terms used\u00a0that was enough to satisfy Section 702\u2019s requirement of keeping search records, but the court found that because they did not specify which queries were related to a \u201cUnited States person,\u201d it did not satisfy the law\u2019s requirement. For context, the FISC ruling noted that in 2017, the FBI ran \"approximately 3.1 million queries against raw FISA-acquired information, including section 702-acquired information.\" While the FBI's failure to specify which ones pertained to U.S. persons, making it difficult to determine how many searches were affected by their insufficient practices, Judge James Boasberg\u00a0noted that \"given the FBI's domestic focus it seems likely that a significant percentage of its queries involve U.S.-person query terms.\" Boasberg's ruling also ordered the government to keep written records of each instance where the FBI reviews information \u201cconcerning a United States person\u201d obtained through Section 702, where the query was \u201cnot designed to find and extract foreign-intelligence information.\" These records shall include details of the information, how it is meant to be used, and the search terms used to get the information. After the July 2019 FISC-R decision, the FBI submitted new proposed procedures that the court deemed acceptable in a September ruling. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The newly released decisions came after FISC Judge Rosemary Collyer\u2019s 2017 ruling, which found that officials under the Obama administration used FISA to conduct illegal surveillance of American citizens for years. A soon-to-be-released report from the Justice Department Inspector General will explore whether the FBI conducted a different sort of FISA abuse in connection with former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. During the early stages of the investigation of Russian interference with the 2016 election, the FBI obtained a warrant to monitor Page, which Republicans claim was based on a misrepresentation of evidence in the form of an unverified dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele as opposition research for Democrats and the Clinton campaign.",

Between April and May 2018, Frese allegedly accessed classified intelligence reports \u2013 some of which were unrelated to his job duties \u2013 and leaked secret information regarding a foreign country\u2019s weapons system to a reporter, according to court documents. The documents accused Frese of being\u00a0romantically involved with one of the reporters to whom he allegedly leaked information. A criminal indictment said a first reporter wrote at least eight articles from five compromised intelligence reports leaked by Frese. It said Frese re-tweeted a link to one of the articles that\u00a0used the information he allegedly had provided. The first reporter then asked Frese if he\u2019d be willing to speak to another reporter, according to the criminal indictment. Frese allegedly said he was \u201cdown\u201d to help the second reporter if it helped the first reporter \u201cprogress.\u201d The indictment also accused Frese of\u00a0speaking about classified national defense information to the second reporter via his cellphone on Sept. 24, 2019.

The arraignment and detention hearing for Henry Kyle Frese has been set for Friday at 11 a.m. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Frese, 30, a counterterrorism analyst who held a top-secret clearance at the DIA, had started\u00a0as a contractor in January 2017 before working at the agency\u00a0full time. He faces two counts of willful transmission of national defense information to persons not entitled to receive it, charges that come with up to 10 years in prison each.",

      "title": "Providing health insurance to illegal immigrants could cost up to $23 billion a year, study finds", 
      "content": " In the span of just a few months, the idea of providing health care to illegal immigrants has morphed from a fringe, left-wing fancy to a\u00a0plank of many 2020 Democrats' presidential campaigns\u00a0-- but it\u2019s a proposal that one study predicts\u00a0would cost American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year. A standout moment\u00a0of the June 27\u00a0Democratic primary debate was that of all the candidates on the stage raising their hands, signifying support for\u00a0government\u00a0health care plans including \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrants. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SHOULD GET HEALTH CARE, SAY DEMS IN NIGHT 2 DEBATE Republicans and the White House have seized on that moment, with President Trump declaring it \u201cthe end of the race.\u201d But with the campaign\u00a0definitely not over, and a number of frontrunners now backing the policy, more attention is turning to how much it could cost to give\u00a0millions of illegal immigrants health insurance. On Thursday, the Center for Immigration Studies\u00a0(CIS), a policy group that advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, published a study finding\u00a0that the cost could be up to $23 billion a year. While candidates have not necessarily gone into detail\u00a0about their plans, CIS cites an Atlantic survey that found that Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.;\u00a0and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro would all provide \u201cfull benefits\u201d to those in the country illegally. The CIS study estimated that\u00a04.9 million illegal immigrants have incomes below 400 percent of the poverty line and also do not have insurance -- meaning they have incomes low enough to receive coverage via either Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act -- also known to many, particularly critics, as ObamaCare. The study estimates that if all income-eligible, uninsured illegal immigrants received subsidies under the ACA, then the cost to insure would be $22.6 billion, but with \u201clikely enrollment\u201d of 46 percent, the total cost would be perhaps $10.4 billion a year. It predicts that the average cost of a subsidized premium would be $4,637. If a mixed approach of ACA subsidies and Medicaid enrollment were\u00a0used, the cost would dip\u00a0to $19.6 billion with 100 percent enrollment, and $10.7 billion assuming \u201clikely enrollment.\u201d These numbers could change significantly if\u00a0a more overarching\u00a0health care overhaul is passed by a future Democratic White House and Congress. \u201cNumbers aside, the fact that presidential candidates are advocating spending billions of dollars on people who are in the country illegally is significant in its own right,\u201d the report concludes. \u201cIt suggests that allowing in large numbers of less-educated workers will inevitably generate significant political pressure to provide them access to social programs.\u201d Extending health care to illegal immigrants could, however, be only one part of the cost to taxpayers of more generous social policies being pushed by Democrats. AOC PUSHES NATIONAL RENT CONTROL, WELFARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN LATEST MASSIVE PROPOSAL Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was an early champion of left-favored\u00a0policies\u00a0now finding their way into 2020 Democratic platforms, recently introduced a new package of policies known as the \u201cJust Society.\u201d Among those bills is \u201cThe Embrace Act,\u201d which would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as U.S. citizens and those in the country legally. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM \"Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual\u2019s immigration status,\u201d the bill reads. The bill defines a federal public benefit as: \u201cany grant, contract, loan, professional license\u00a0or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; and ... any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post-secondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit,or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.\u201d",

      "title": "Carter Page frustrated he hasn't been interviewed in IG probe", 
      "content": " Former Trump campaign adviser\u00a0Carter Page confirmed to Fox News on Thursday that he has not been interviewed by Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz as part of his probe into potential surveillance abuses by intelligence officials during the Russia investigation. Page\u00a0told Fox News that he is frustrated that he has had no input in Horowitz's review, given his central role in the probe. Page was monitored by the FBI pursuant to a\u00a0Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant that was approved in October 2016 and renewed several times. Last month, Horowitz told lawmakers\u00a0his team is nearly finished with its long-awaited review of alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and FBI,\u00a0saying it has submitted a draft to Attorney General Bill Barr\u00a0and is\u00a0\u201cfinalizing\u201d the report ahead of its public release. NEWLY DECLASSIFIED DOCS REVEAL FISA ABUSES IN TARGETING AMERICANS The inspector general said his team has \u201creviewed over 1\u00a0million records and conducted over 100 interviews, including several of witnesses who only recently agreed to be interviewed.\u201d But RealClearInvestigations first reported that Page was not among those witnesses. \u201cWe have now begun the process of finalizing our report by providing a draft of our factual findings to the department and the FBI for classification determination and marking,\u201d Horowitz\u00a0wrote in a letter to several House and Senate committees. \u201cThis step is consistent with our process for reports such as this one that involve classified material.\u201d The FISA warrant applications targeting Page relied heavily on the now-discredited Steele dossier on Trump, which was funded by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign.\u00a0The FBI formally documented the apparent anti-Trump bias of the dossier's author, British ex-spy\u00a0Christopher Steele,\u00a0shortly after the\u00a0November 2016 presidential election --\u00a0yet despite the red flags, continued to use his unverified\u00a0dossier in the FISA applications,\u00a0records\u00a0obtained by Fox News earlier this year showed. WATCH: CARTER PAGE SAYS FBI INFORMANT 'INTENSIFIED' COMMS JUST BEFORE FISA WARRANT Meanwhile, a key FBI player during the time frame, former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, is facing the prospect of federal charges after Horowitz faulted him in a separate inquiry over\u00a0statements he made during a Hillary Clinton-related investigation. The review found that McCabe \"lacked candor\" when talking with investigators, but the former FBI official has denied wrongdoing. Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu has recommended moving forward with charges against McCabe, a CNN contributor, though no indictment has been handed down. Horowitz's inquiry is not the only ongoing review at the DOJ. Barr has also assigned John Durham, the U.S. attorney for\u00a0Connecticut, to conduct an inquiry into alleged misconduct and alleged improper government surveillance on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. Fox News reported this week that based on what he has been finding, Durham has expanded his investigation adding agents and resources, according to\u00a0senior administration officials. The timeline has grown from the beginning of the probe through the election and now has included a post-election timeline through the spring of 2017, up to when Robert Mueller was named special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 elections. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And U.S. Attorney John Huber was appointed by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to review not only alleged surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and the FBI, but also their handling of the investigation into the Clinton Foundation and other matters.

      "content": " Two associates of Rudy Giuliani made their initial appearance before a federal judge on Thursday, less than 24 hours after they were arrested on campaign finance violations while trying to board an international flight with one-way tickets at Dulles International Airport outside of Washington D.C. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman appeared in\u00a0federal court in Alexandria, Va. to face a four-count indictment alleging that they, along with two other co-defendants, conspired to violate a\u00a0ban on foreign donations and contributions in connection with federal and state elections. The two men remained mostly silent during their appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Nachmanoff, who set their bond at $1 million each.\u00a0Nachmanoff said\u00a0he was reluctant to agree to a bond package but noted the mens' defense team and the government had agreed on it. Terms of bond included $1 million per suspect and\u00a0the surrender of passports and all other travel documents, as well as travel restricted to the Southern District of Florida and Southern District of New York. They also will be subject to home detention and GPS monitoring, according to the agreement. Both Parnas and Fruman are expected to remain in custody for at least the remainder of the day, until the terms of the bond are met. \"You will be stuck here in limbo if the terms of the bond are not met,\"\u00a0Nachmanoff said. GIULIANI ON TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: SALEM WITCH TRIALS 'FAIRER THAN THIS' The next\u00a0hearing was scheduled for Oct. 17 in the Southern District of New York, where their indictments originated. \u201cProtecting the integrity of our\u00a0elections and protecting our\u00a0elections from unlawful foreign\u00a0influence are core functions of\u00a0our campaign finance laws,\u201d Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman\u00a0said at a news conference Thursday. Berman added: \u201cAs this office has made clear,\u00a0we will not hesitate to\u00a0investigate or prosecute those\u00a0who engage in criminal conduct\u00a0that draws into question the\u00a0integrity of our political\u00a0process, and I want to add that this\u00a0investigation is continuing.\u201d Parnas, 47, and Fruman, 53, created Global Energy Producers (GEP), and allegedly funneled money through the company. This included contributions of $325,000 and $15,000 to committees in May 2018, \u201cto obtain access to exclusive political events and gain influence with politicians,\u201d the indictment says. They allegedly incorporated GEP around the time the contributions were made. According to Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, GEP contributed $325,000 in May 2018 to pro-Trump super PAC America\u00a0First Action. In a statement, a\u00a0spokesperson for America First Action noted that a complaint was filed with the FEC in July 2018 over this contribution, as well as separate litigation in Florida. The statement said\u00a0that the money was placed \"in a segregated bank account,\" was not used, and \"will remain in this segregated account until these matters are resolved.\" President Trump said Thursday afternoon\u00a0he does not know Parnas and Fruman, but might have met them at a fundraiser at one point. \"I don\u2019t know those gentlemen,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"Now, it's possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody.\" Parnas and Fruman were featured in a photo alongside the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., at a table apparently at the Beverly Hills Polo Lounge. The photo was posted on Parnas' Facebook page on May 21, 2018. Both men are accused of making false statements related to the nature of GEP and the contribution in response to the FEC complaint. BIDEN CAMPAIGN SLAMS NY TIMES FOR RUNNING \u2018CLINTON CASH\u2019 AUTHOR\u2019S OP-ED ON EX-VP\u2019s UKRAINE TIES Additionally, contributions from Fruman were allegedly made in Parnas\u2019 name to get around federal contribution limits, and several contributions were made under the name \"Igor Furman\" instead of \"Fruman,\" allegedly \"to conceal the source of the funds and to evade federal reporting requirements.\" The indictment also claims that Parnas and Fruman \u201ccommitted to raise $20,000 or more for a then-sitting U.S. Congressman\u201d\u00a0whom they had met at a political event. The congressman wasn't identified by name in court papers, but the donations to \"Congressman 1\" in the indictment match campaign finance reports for former Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who lost his re-election bid in November 2018. At approximately the same time that they made that commitment, Parnas and the Congressman discussed the Congressman's assistance in securing the removal of the then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, and this was done \"at least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials,\" the indictment alleges. The indictment also lays out allegations of a separate \"foreign national donor scheme\" involving the two men and two other defendants, American David Correia, and Ukrainian national Andrey Kukushkin. The foursome\u00a0allegedly engaged in a conspiracy to make political contributions funded by an unnamed Russian national to obtain influence with political candidates regarding policies to benefit a recreational marijuana business venture, and to help obtain retail marijuana licenses. House Democrats on Thursday subpoenaed Parnas and Fruman as part of the impeachment inquiry into Trump. The subpoenas are for documents that the men have so far failed to provide to Congress. Parnas and Fruman were involved in Giuliani's efforts to urge Ukrainian officials to investigate Trump's political rival Joe Biden and his family. That effort was also discussed by Trump in a July call with Ukraine's president and is at the heart of the impeachment probe. Giuliani told Fox News that he represents Parnas and Fruman on a separate matter and called the timing of their arrest and indictment \"suspect.\" He added that he \"will reveal relevant facts very very shortly.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Giuliani, a personal\u00a0attorney for\u00a0Trump, said he finds it \"extremely suspicious\" that the arrest was made in connection with an FEC matter that has yet to be resolved, and which Giuliani said is a civil matter. He acknowledged, however, that both men \"logistically helped\" in his collection of evidence against Hunter Biden, and that they helped connect him with\u00a0Viktor Shokin and Yuriy Lutsenko former Prosecutors General of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose July phone call with Trump jumpstarted the impeachment inquiry, denied on Thursday knowing Parnas and Fruman and said Washington so far has not requested any documents from him regarding the two men.

      "content": "  Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, implored\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to halt what he called \u201csecret\u201d impeachment proceedings against President Trump Thursday, saying: \"The American public deserves to see this impeachment firsthand for themselves, not just what you, your colleagues, and your staff anonymously leak about it.\" Turner, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, took particular issue with the panel's Oct. 3 transcribed interview of former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and subsequent media leaks that he says are in \"direct contradiction with Volker's testimony.\" \"Nothing in that [Volker's] testimony was classified, and yet it was conducted behind closed doors and a transcript has yet to be released,\" Turner wrote. \"The American public deserve to witness these hearings, not just receive anonymous secondhand reports ... This represents an attempt by you [Pelosi] to totally control what information the American public is receiving in reporting on this impeachment inquiry.\" WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES IT WILL NOT COMPLY WITH 'ILLEGITIMATE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY Republicans and Democrats present at Volker\u2019s interview had wildly different interpretations of the information he provided. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told reporters after the meeting, \u201cnot one thing he [Volker] said comports with any of the Democrats' impeachment narrative.\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said Volker\u2019s testimony made it clear \u201cthere was a shadow shakedown going on\u201d in Ukraine led by\u00a0Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Appearing on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d Thursday, Jordan pressured House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to release the full transcript of the\u00a0Volker\u00a0interview\u00a0to show there was no quid pro quo agreement between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky involving U.S. military aid and Trump\u2019s call for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden. \"He was clear about that [and] reinforced exactly what President Zelensky said when he said, 'I was not pushed by the administration,'\" Jordan said. \"Adam Schiff won't release that. Instead, there were 67 pages of text messages. Adam Schiff took a few of those text messages and released them. Release them all.\" REP. JORDAN CHALLENGES SCHIFF TO RELEASE CLOSED-DOOR TESTIMONY THAT SHATTERS UKRAINE 'QUID PRO QUO' THEORY Turner also alleged that Democratic-led House committees \"are discussing holding not only secret hearings, but interviewing secret witnesses.\" \u201cYou are robbing the American public of their right to judge for themselves the veracity and credibility of these witnesses and this investigation,\" Turner wrote to Pelosi. \"The American public is also unable in this process to judge the professionalism, predisposition, and bias of the questioners in this inquiry.\" Turner then cited a CNN report that\u00a0House of Representative General Counsel Doug Letter told a federal judge that\u00a0the president did not have to commit a crime to be impeached. The question came up in a hearing over a request by the House for grand jury testimony related to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. \u201cThe Constitution is clear: 'The President ... shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and\u00a0Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'\u00a0A crime must be committed. However, your legal counsel is now trying to argue blatantly against the Constitution,\u201d Turner wrote (emphasis original). \u201cYou have said the country is in a constitutional crisis. You are right, Madam Speaker, we are, and it is by your design and creation.\u201d Turner also raised the issue of Schiff\u2019s staff having contact with the intelligence community\u00a0whistleblower whose complaint prompted the formal impeachment inquiry prior to the complaint being filed. Schiff\u2019s office acknowledged last week that the whistleblower had reached out to them before filing the complaint in mid-August, but said that Schiff himself had not had any direct contact with the whistleblower. \"The American public has a right to know the extent to which you, your colleagues, and your staff have been involved in secret discussions with the complainant on which you based your unilateral assertion of authority to commence impeachment proceedings,\u201d Turner wrote. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cMadam Speaker, I remember firsthand watching the Nixon impeachment hearings,\u00a0the congressman concluded. \"Your impeachment inquiry, in sharp contrast, is being conducted in secret hearings, with potentially secret witnesses, and has a secret inception. The American public and our constitutional processes deserve transparency.\u201d Last month, Turner stood apart from his Republican colleagues by asserting that Trump's phone call with Zelensky was \"not ok.\" \"Concerning that conversation, I want to say to the President: This is not OK. That conversation is not OK,\" Turner said during a Sept. 26 hearing with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. \"I\u00a0think it's disappointing to the American public when they read the [conversation's]\u00a0transcript.\"",

Cruz, along with several other lawmakers including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., sent a letter to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on Wednesday expressing \"deep concern\" over the league's deference to China\u00a0after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. TAIWAN PRESIDENT REJECTS CHINA'S OFFER OF 'ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS' \"The NBA's initial statement, and pressure placed on Mr. Morey to back away from his statement,\u00a0has not only sold out an American citizen,\" the letter said.\u00a0\"It reinforces the Chinese Communist Party view that those who point to Chinese repression in Hong Kong are at best stating opinions, not facts, and that the official Chinese government view deserves equal respect.\" Recent pro-democracy protests rebelling against\u00a0Beijing's perceived\u00a0interference\u00a0in Hong Kong's independence\u00a0have gained attention around the world. After the lawmakers' letter, however, the NBA drew more China-related\u00a0ire Wednesday night after workers\u00a0confiscated\u00a0signs supporting\u00a0Hong Kong at a Washington Wizards game in Washington, D.C. At least one sign read \"Google Uyghurs\" -- a Muslim ethnic group with between one and five million members in Chinese government concentration camps. A team spokesman said the displays violated the arena's longstanding policy on signs, banners and posters. In addition, on Thursday, a Houston Rockets employee told a CNN reporter that players James Harden and Russell Westbrook would not answer her question about how they would approach speaking out on politics after the Morey controversy.\u00a0The league later apologized. Yet more Chinese censorship-related controversies have raged in the U.S. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Activision-Blizzard, a U.S.-based video game company, is coming under fire after it made an E-sports player forfeit $10,000 in prize money and banned him from the game Hearthstone E-sports\u00a0for a year after he made pro-Hong Kong comments on a broadcast. Company executives said he\u00a0violated a tournament rule preventing players from engaging in any act that \"brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\" Comedy Central cartoon \"South Park,\" in contrast, fired up a profane response\u00a0to its recent ban in China for an episode last week bashing the government's censorship of American media and treatment of its citizens.

      "title": "Fox News Poll: Biden and Warren gain ground in Democratic race", 
      "content": " Together Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren capture the support of more than half of Democratic primary voters, according to the latest Fox News national poll on the 2020 election. Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September.\u00a0 He\u2019s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that\u2019s up 6 points and a new high for her.\u00a0Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month. While Biden\u2019s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June. The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O\u2019Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent.\u00a0 Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS Biden retains top billing with strong support among non-whites, voters over age 45, and moderates/conservatives.\u00a0 Warren has strengthened her position by increasing support among suburban voters, very liberals, and men. When Democratic primary voters\u2019 first and second choice preferences are considered together, Biden and Warren tie at 45 percent support, Sanders is at 34 percent, Harris 15 percent and Buttigieg 13 percent. President Trump\u2019s allegations about improper actions by Biden and his son have so far failed to chip away at Biden\u2019s support in the primary race -- and Democratic primary voters continue to believe the former vice president is the candidate best equipped to beat Trump in 2020:\u00a0 43 percent feel that way, up from 42 percent last month.\u00a0 Nineteen percent think Warren has the best chance to oust Trump and 15 percent say Sanders. At the same time, the poll finds the three top Democratic candidates with sizable leads over the president in potential head-to-head matchups. The poll, released Thursday, shows Biden (50-40 percent) and Warren (50-40 percent) both top Trump by 10 points, and Sanders is up by 9 (49-40 percent).\u00a0 This marks the first time all three Democrats have held a lead outside the poll\u2019s margin of error.\u00a0 Last month, Biden was up by 14 points, Warren by 6 and Sanders by 8. \u201cIf Warren continues to poll as strongly against Trump as the former vice president, it makes it increasingly difficult for the Biden team to keep making the argument he is the most electable candidate,\u201d says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw. The impeachment inquiry hasn\u2019t caused any real shifts in the ballot test, as Trump\u2019s support in the two-way matchups has been between 37-42 percent all year.\u00a0 However, the poll finds an 8-point shift since last month in the number expecting Trump will be re-elected.\u00a0 In September, more thought he would win by a 6-point margin and now more expect he won\u2019t by 2 points. And while most Republican primary voters want to keep Trump as their party\u2019s nominee, nearly one in five, 17 percent, would like to see someone else run. \u201cSo far, Trump has been able to keep his Republican base on board,\u201d says Shaw. \u201cIf the percentage opposing his re-nomination creeps into the 20s, that would be a troubling sign.\u201d Meanwhile, voters continue to believe Donald Trump is dishonest.\u00a0 Sixty-three percent say that -- far more than the 35 percent who think he is honest and trustworthy.\u00a0 By the way, that\u2019s the same number who said Trump was honest before he won the 2016 election. Vice President Mike Pence does a bit better than his boss, although not by much:\u00a0 39 percent say he\u2019s honest and 54 percent say dishonest. On the other side, each of the top three Democratic candidates receives positive ratings on this measure.\u00a0 Sanders performs best with 59 percent saying he is honest and trustworthy (36 percent disagree).\u00a0 Fifty percent think Warren is honest vs. 44 percent dishonest, and for Biden voters split 48-47 percent. Among Democrats, 87 percent think Sanders is honest and trustworthy, while 81 percent feel that way about Warren and 75 percent Biden.\u00a0 Seventy-three percent of Republicans say Trump is honest. Currently, 51 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of Sanders, while 43 percent view him negatively.\u00a0 That puts him in positive territory by 8 points.\u00a0 More view Warren positively by 7 points (46 favorable vs. 39 unfavorable) and Biden by 6 (50 favorable vs. 44 unfavorable). The ratings are closer to even for Buttigieg (+3 points), Yang (+3), Booker (-2), Harris (-3) and O\u2019Rourke (-4).\u00a0 They each also have large numbers who have never heard of them or have no opinion of them.\u00a0 For example, 43 percent of voters are unable to rate Yang, while 36 percent can\u2019t rate Buttigieg and 32 percent can\u2019t rate Booker. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Voters view Trump more negatively than positively by 13 points (43-56).\u00a0 His personal favorable rating was underwater by 22 points in the days leading up to the 2016 election (38-60). Twice as many primary voters say Trump\u2019s allegations make them more likely to vote for Biden (21 percent more vs. 10 percent less), while twice as many say health concerns make them less (31 percent) rather than more likely (15 percent) to vote for Sanders in the primary. Sanders is off the campaign trail since suffering a heart attack October 3.\u00a0 He\u2019s 78 years old, while Biden is 76, Trump is 73, and Warren is 70. Conducted October 6-8, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,003 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.\u00a0 The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters and 4.5 points for Democratic primary voters (484).",

      "content": " House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R.-Wyo., along with 20 Republican colleagues, said Thursday that legislation is being introduced to sanction Turkey for its\u00a0military offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northern Syria. The announcement came as Turkey\u2019s Defense Ministry boasted Thursday that more than 150 Kurdish forces have been mowed down since the\u00a0assault began one day ago. TURKEY'S MILITARY ASSAULT IN SYRIA LEAVES MORE THAN 150 KURDISH FIGHTERS DEAD, OFFICIALS SAY \u201cPresident [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan and his regime must face serious consequences for mercilessly attacking our Kurdish allies in northern Syria, who incurred thousands of casualties in the fight against ISIS and helped us protect the homeland,\u201d said Cheney. \u201cThese sanctions are not only a response to the Erdogan regime\u2019s violent attacks in northern Syria. Congress has long had concerns about the regime\u2019s cooperation with U.S. adversaries, such as Russia. \"If Turkey wants to be treated like an ally, it must begin behaving like one. They must be sanctioned for their attacks on our Kurdish allies.\" Much to the frustration of U.S. leaders, Turkey acquired a Russian S-400 air defense system in July. The deal with Russia -- the first such arrangement between Russia and a NATO member -- raised concerns that Turkey is drifting ever closer to Moscow\u2019s sphere of influence. Cheney\u2019s office indicated that the legislation aligns with what President Trump has said\u00a0about Turkey in the past. \u201cTurkey has been planning to attack the Kurds for a long time,\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday. \u201cI say hit Turkey very hard financially & with sanctions if they don\u2019t play by the rules!\u201d HOUSE DEMS SUBPOENA ENERGY SECRETARY RICK PERRY FOR UKRAINE DOCS IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY \u201cPresident Erdogan\u2019s assault on our Kurdish allies is reckless and reprehensible. The Kurds sacrificed 10,000 of their own men and women combatting ISIS, and we cannot allow Turkey, a NATO partner, to attack them without repercussions,\u201d said co-sponsor Adam Kinzinger, R.-Ill. Cheney\u2019s bill follows a similar one in the Senate announced Wednesday by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R.-S.C., and Chris Van Hollen, D.-Md. The Senate bill would sanction the U.S. assets of Turkish political leadership,\u00a0restrict military transactions with any foreign entity (including the U.S.) and Turkey, and penalize\u00a0anyone who makes\u00a0transactions with Turkey\u2019s energy sector. Cheney, daughter of former Vice President to George W. Bush Vice President Dick Cheney,\u00a0has repeatedly sounded off about Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces in northeastern Syria. In one tweet, she called it a \"catastrophic mistake that puts our gains against ISIS at risk and threatens U.S. security.\" Critics have decried the decision by Trump, which they say undermines progress against ISIS in the region and leaves a U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State vulnerable. In another, she called President Trump's pullback \"impossible to understand.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",

      "title": "House Dems subpoena Energy Secretary Rick Perry for Ukraine docs in impeachment inquiry", 
      "content": " Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Thursday became the latest Trump administration official to be subpoenaed in connection with the House impeachment inquiry, as a trio of House Democratic committee chairmen\u00a0requested documents relating to Ukraine. The House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees requested \"key documents\" from Perry by Oct. 18, the chairmen announced in a press release. Department of Energy (DOE) Spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes told Fox News, \"The Department of Energy is aware of the House Committees\u2019 letter to Secretary Perry and it is currently under review by DOE's Office of General Counsel.\" Democrats have already subpoenaed\u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the\u00a0Pentagon, the White House Office of Management and Budget\u00a0and U.S. Ambassador to the\u00a0European Union\u00a0Gordon Sondland for documents as lawmakers probe a\u00a0July 25 phone call between President Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cRecently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president\u2019s stark message to the Ukrainian president,\" Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff, Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel said\u00a0of Perry. \u201cThese reports have also raised significant questions about your efforts to press Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company to benefit individuals involved with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s push to get Ukrainian officials to interfere in our 2020 election.\" Two associates of Trump lawyer and confidant\u00a0Rudy Giuliani\u00a0who have been linked to his efforts to conduct\u00a0investigations in Ukraine were\u00a0indicted for campaign finance violations, according to court documents released Thursday. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are accused of using a limited liability company to make political contributions related to American elections, which violates Federal Election Commission (FEC) rules barring contributions from foreign nationals. GIULIANI\u00a0ASSOCIATES ARRESTED WHILE TRYING TO BOARD INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT WITH ONE-WAY TICKETS, PROSECUTORS SAY The expanding impeachment probe was launched last month after an intelligence community member's\u00a0whistleblower complaint\u00a0raised concerns about the president's Ukraine phone call.\u00a0In it, Trump asked Zelensky to probe onetime Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter and their business dealings in Ukraine. Joe Biden has for months been seen as the Democrats' frontrunner in the 2020 election against Trump. Trump has denied abusing his position, saying the call was \"perfect,\" and Zelensky said Thursday there was \"no blackmail\" during their call. The whistleblower accused the president of \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\" claiming Trump\u00a0used\u00a0$400 million in military aid, frozen in the days before that fateful phone call,\u00a0to induce Zelensky to open a\u00a0Biden inquiry. Trump reportedly told House Republicans it was Perry who suggested he call Zelensky back in July, according to news outlet Axios. RICK PERRY DENIES DISCUSSING BIDENS WITH TRUMP OR UKRAINE OFFICIALS: REPORTS According to one source, Trump said something to the effect of: \"Not a lot of people know this but, I didn't even want to make the call. The only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to. Something about an LNG [liquified natural gas] plant,\" Axios reported, saying two other sources agreed with that recollection. Perry denied ever mentioning the Bidens during discussions with Ukrainian officials or the president. On Friday he told the Christian Broadcasting Network in an exclusive interview that his dealings in Ukraine were part of the United States' effort to clean up corruption there. President Trump has said Joe Biden's efforts to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the energy firm\u00a0Burisma Holdings -- where Hunter Biden had held a board seat\u00a0-- should be investigated for corruption. On Monday, Perry denied rumors that he would resign at the end of November amid questions about his role in the controversy surrounding the now-infamous Trump-Zelensky call. READ THE\u00a0WHITE HOUSE LETTER The White House issued an eight-page letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on\u00a0Tuesday and said\u00a0it\u00a0wouldn't comply\u00a0with the \"illegitimate and unconstitutional\" impeachment inquiry.

The request by Rodney Davis, R-Ill.\u00a0was outlined in a 4-page memo to FEC Inspector General Christopher L. Skinner. In it, Davis chastised FEC Chair Ellen L. Weintraub for using government time and resources for \u201cideological, and at times, political, purposes.\u201d He recounted four instances where Weintraub had used FEC resources to publish her personal opinions on President Trump. In a February 2017 statement issued on FEC letterhead, Weintraub requested the president show evidence of \"alleged voter fraud in New Hampshire,\"\u00a0a reference to Trump\u2019s claim that illegal voting had cost him the state's four electoral votes in the 2016 presidential election. In a March follow-up letter, Weintraub reiterated that request. In May 2017, Weintraub wrote a statement, again on FEC letterhead, rebuking Trump for his creation of an Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, saying: \u201cMr. President, take responsibility for your words. Document them if you can. Apologize to them if you have to. But don\u2019t ship them off to a commission.\u201d FEC CHAIR: TRUMP IS 'DAMAGING TO OUR DEMOCRACY' WITH 'BASELESS' VOTER FRAUD ALLEGATIONS Weintraub wrote a second letter to Trump about his New Hampshire voter fraud claims in August 2019 in a tone Davis described as \u201cpartisan snark.\u201d \u201cTo put it in terms a former casino operator should understand: There comes a time when you need to lay your cards on the fable or fold,\u201d she wrote. The letter was not hosted on the FEC website, but was drafted with the agency\u2019s letterhead and appeared on Weintraub\u2019s Twitter feed, according to Davis. Davis also criticized Weintraub for appearances on CNN and MSNBC to \u201cdiscuss matters outside the purview of the FEC.\u201d On at least two occasions, Weintraub\u00a0dismissed Trump\u2019s claims as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d that are \u201cdamaging to our democracy.\u201d Davis argued that Weintraub had violated the FEC\u2019s nonpartisan position by failing to indicate \u201cin any interview that she was speaking as a private citizen and not as Chair of the nonpartisan FEC.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Because of her ostensible bias against President Trump, Weintraub \u201cshould publicly admit her political differences with the President, disclose her conflict of interest, and at the very least, recuse herself from voting on Matters Under Review involving the President,\u201d Davis wrote. Responding to Davis\u2019 memo\u00a0via Twitter, Weintraub wrote she would \u201cnot be silenced\u201d and that the \u201cindependence of the United States Federal Election Commission will not be compromised.\u201d Reached out to for comment, Weintraub directed Fox News to the tweet.",

Bob Kroll, president of the \u00a0Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis,\u00a0said at the \"Keep America Great rally\" at the Target Center in Minnesota. \"They don't want the police here when it's a Republican who stands up for the police, but if it's a Democrat we get a different story.

      "content": " President Trump\u00a0unloaded on Joe and Hunter Biden over their Ukrainian business dealings\u00a0in Minneapolis on Thursday evening -- at one point bringing the crowd to its feet by charging that Biden's\u00a0only useful trait as vice president was his preternatural ability to \"kiss Barack Obama's a--.\" Trump cited a new report in The Washington Examiner that the whistleblower at the center of Democrats' impeachment push had worked with Biden. The whistleblower's anti-Trump attorney, Mark Zaid, acknowledged earlier in the week that his client had \"contact\" with current presidential contenders \"from both parties.\" The president also derided the Biden campaign for aggressively seeking to convince Facebook and The New York Times, as well as all major television networks,\u00a0not to cover what it called \"conspiracy theories\" about potential Biden corruption. Scores of Trump supporters, as well as pro-impeachment demonstrators, lined up hours before the event at the Target Center in downtown Minneapolis began. At least one protester was photographed pouring milk on his face to counter the effects of pepper spray, as chaos unfolded outside the arena -- with pro-Trump hats being lit on fire, as some demonstrators\u00a0harassed police and assaulted Trump supporters. \"The Bidens got rich -- and that is substantiated -- while America got robbed,\" Trump said. \"Sleepy Joe and his friends sold out America. ... And in a brand new report, just came out as I'm walking on the stage, it turns out that when Joe Biden was vice president -- he worked with the so-called whistleblower.\u00a0 This is nothing more than a partisan witch hunt, sabotage, and I'm sure they're going to say, 'totally unsubstantiated.'\" As the crowd erupted into applause, Trump remarked, \"Isn't it much better when I go off script? So much better.\" Trump set a fiery tone within minutes of taking the stage, as he relentlessly mocked ex-FBI officials and lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page with a passionate\u00a0dramatic reading of their anti-Trump text messages. He also touted the country's economy and suggested the U.S. will prevail in its trade war with China -- without mentioning the growing issue of censorship in the U.S. over ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The rally, Trump's first since the House moved toward impeachment over his handling of a July phone call with Ukraine's president, was in a state Trump nearly won in 2016 and has talked frequently of capturing in 2020. But, it took place in a traditionally liberal city and the home turf of a frequent foil, Rep. Ilhan Omar. To loud booing during the rally, Trump slammed the Democrat as \"an America-hating socialist\" who \"minimized the September 11 terror attack on our homeland.\" He also outlined comments from Omar that even top Democrats have admitted were anti-Semitic, before asking, \"How do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota? I'm very angry at you people. She is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that I am going to win, and that the Republican Party is going to win, Minnesota in 13 months.\" A chant of \"four more years\" broke out -- in sharp contrast to the \"send her back\"\u00a0rallying cry\u00a0from a July rally in North Carolina that was directed at Omar. Trump later condemned that chant, which came after the president asked why unnamed \"Democrat Congresswomen\" didn't \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came, then come back and show us how it is done.\" WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY ADMITS CLIENT HAD CONTACT WITH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, AS LAWYER'S ANTI-TRUMP BIAS SURFACES Trump hit Democrats for bringing in too\u00a0many refugees without proper security controls, noting that he has \"reduced refugee resettlement by 85 percent\" since taking office. The president thanked Mexico for agreeing to deploy its soldiers to help curtail illegal immigration at the border pursuant to a deal the White House struck earlier this year -- a move that Trump said would help avert a humanitarian crisis like the one unfolding in Europe. Later in the rally, Trump explained his decision to\u00a0expose U.S.-allied Kurds to Turkish invasion by telling the crowd how difficult it was to inform the families of fallen U.S. servicemembers how \"their child has died.\" Keeping troops on guard to prevent Turkish incursion, Trump said, was an unnecessary risk of U.S. personnel. TUCKER: OUTRAGE OVER TRUMP'S KURD DECISION SHOWS HOW PERVERSE D.C. IS \"I have to sign these letters,\" Trump said, saying it also was \"very tough\" to go to Dover Air Force Base to \"meet the parents and families and wives and children, sisters and brothers\" of fallen soldiers who arrive in coffins. \"It's time to bring 'em home,\" Trump said to applause, referring generally to U.S. soldiers overseas. \"We've done our job.\" At the rally, Trump said over 20,000 people were inside the arena -- and over 25,000 were outside, out of nearly 100,000 who indicated online they wanted to attend. Before the president took the stage, his son Eric Trump briefly encouraged a \"lock him up\" chant directed at Joe and Hunter Biden, before telling the crowd it wouldn't be necessary because Biden will lose his bid for the White House. ANDY MCCARTHY TAKES A LOOK AT DEMS' IMPEACHMENT PUSH The president turned to\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's comments earlier Thursday concerning\u00a0their fateful phone call. Zelensky unequivocally told reporters the call involved no bribe, blackmail or quid pro quo, as impeachment-minded Democrats claimed. \"That should be the end of it,\" Trump told rallygoers. \"We released a transcript of that call, which was so good that Crooked [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam Schiff had to make up a fake conversation that never happened, and he delivered it to the United States Congress and the American people. It was a total fraud. And then, [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi said, 'Oh, I think the president said that.'\u00a0These people are sick.\" Trump argued that Democrats never anticipated he\u00a0would release a full transcript of his call with Zelensky, and recklessly locked themselves into their impeachment inquiry before they even read the document. \"Where's Hunter?\" Trump asked rallygoers at one point, referring to Biden's son. Both Joe and Hunter Biden mostly have avoided taking questions about their Ukraine\u00a0dealings in recent days. The president then launched into a mock interview with Hunter, whom Trump called \"not too smart.\" \"Hunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly. Hunter, you're a loser,\" Trump said, his voice rising.\u00a0\"Your father was never considered smart, he was never considered a good senator -- he was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's a--.\" UKRAINE PRESIDENT SAYS 'NO BLACKMAIL' IN CALL WITH TRUMP Critics have\u00a0alleged\u00a0Hunter -- who secured a lucrative role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings while his father was vice president --\u00a0might have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural-gas production. Police removed protesters throughout the rally, which went ahead as scheduled even after Trump's campaign\u00a0threatened a lawsuit over the city's effort to recover $530,000 in security costs relating to the event. The dispute over the rally's security costs erupted late Monday when the campaign accused Mayor Jacob Frey, a Trump critic, of trying to sink the rally. Frey called the costs reasonable and said he had a duty to protect taxpayers. The campaign said the city sent the security cost estimate to Target Center's operator, AEG Management, which threatened to cancel its contract to host the rally if the costs weren't covered. Its law firm threatened to sue AEG if the rally doesn't proceed. LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS BIDEN, WARREN GAINING -- SANDERS SLIPPING Trump attacked Frey Tuesday on Twitter, writing: \"Someone please tell the Radical Left Mayor of Minneapolis that he can't price out Free Speech. Probably illegal!\" His campaign said the \"bogus security charges\" are an attempt to prevent Minneapolis residents from supporting Trump, and contrasted them with what they said were much smaller charges for a 2009 event by then-President Barack Obama in the same building. \"The radical leftist mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, is abusing the power of his office and attempting to extort President Trump's re-election campaign,\" Trump's campaign said in a statement. LEGAL EXPERTS WEIGH IN AS WHITE HOUSE OBJECTS TO INQUIRY When the rally was announced last month, Frey said Trump's \"message of hatred\" would never be welcome in Minnesota. But, at a news conference Tuesday, he said the city will do all it can to guarantee a \"safe and peaceful week,\" regardless of his political differences with Trump. Frey stood by the security-cost\u00a0estimate, saying a Trump political rally would bring \"significant expenses\" not associated with Obama's 2009 event, which was aimed at building support for health-care reform. Later Tuesday, the Trump campaign said in a statement that the operators of Target Center had backed off canceling the contract, with no agreement by the campaign to pay additional money. AEG didn't respond to messages seeking comment. Trump also attacked Frey over Twitter for a policy prohibiting\u00a0city police officers from wearing their uniforms in support of candidates at political events or in campaign ads. A spokesman for the city's police union has complained about the policy, and the union has been selling \"Cops for Trump\" T-shirts. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Frey said the police force must be nonpartisan and non-ideological. \"They're free to express their First Amendment rights but should do so off-duty,\" he said.

      "content": " Joe Biden\u00a0took to Twitter Thursday to declare, \u201cPresident Trump picked a fight with the wrong guy.\u201d That\u2019s the same line the former vice president used a day earlier \u2013 to a rousing standing ovation \u2013 as Biden, for the first time, unequivocally called for the\u00a0impeachment of Trump. While the president has been front-and-center in the Ukraine\u00a0controversy\u00a0that sparked House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump, Biden\u2019s another key player, and with the impeachment push overshadowing the 2020 White House race, the Democrat has\u00a0grabbed outsized attention over his rivals for the presidential nomination. BIDEN, WARREN, GAIN GROUND IN NEW FOX NEWS POLL It\u2019s a double-edged sword for the former vice president, with Trump\u2019s allegations against Biden\u2019s own Ukraine connection also in the spotlight. Biden on Wednesday launched\u00a0a forceful attack on the president \u2013 coming from a candidate who in recent weeks was anything but aggressive in calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment, unlike most of his 2020 rivals. \u201cWe all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it. It\u2019s no joke,\u201d Biden emphasized during two speeches in New Hampshire. \u201cHe\u2019s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.\u201d Biden\u2019s announcement\u00a0came one day after\u00a0the\u00a0White House vowed not to play ball with the House Democrats\u2019\u00a0impeachment inquiry, but it also came as the former vice president lost his polling status as the unrivaled front-runner. Biden\u2019s neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the top spot in most of the recent national and early-voting-state surveys, although he held a lead in the latest Fox News Poll. FOR FIRST TIME, BIDEN CALLS FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT And, Biden was left in the dust in the race for campaign cash, with both Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each topping him by roughly $10 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising. With those setbacks in mind, the unveiling of the more aggressive, in-your-face approach by Biden has been seen as considerably timely. \u201cIt gets his sea legs under him,\u201d noted Larry Rasky, a longtime Biden friend, adviser\u00a0and fundraiser. \u201cIt gives everybody more energy.\u201d Rasky, who\u2019s not directly involved in Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign, predicted, \u201cit\u2019s definitely going to help fundraising.\u201d He added that donors \u201care happy to see Biden taking on the fight with intensity.\u201d Biden, in his speeches, taunted the president, claiming \u201che\u2019s afraid of just how badly I will beat him next November.\u201d Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran noted that such swagger would resonate with voters. She also said the Ukraine controversy put\u00a0the spotlight on foreign relations, a wheelhouse for the former vice president. \u201cHis remarks yesterday came across as an \u2018enough is enough\u2019 call to action and reminder to the American electorate of the fighter and statesman they have long known,\u201d said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era\u00a0grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies. The impeachment inquiry was sparked by Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in\u00a0the eastern European country. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats\u00a0argued the president was asking a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election. Adding to the controversy was the fact that before that phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine was put on hold. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage,\u00a0Trump has insisted repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no \"quid pro quo\"\u00a0and on numerous occasions has described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as \u201cperfect.\u201d BIDEN CAMPAIGN SLAMS NY TIMES FOR OP-ED ON FORMER VP'S UKRAINE TIES The president and allies instead have tried to put the spotlight\u00a0on Biden and his son. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how\u00a0Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor \u2013 who had faced widespread\u00a0accusations\u00a0of overlooking corruption in his own office\u00a0\u2013 later was dismissed. Biden, defending his actions in Ukraine, said, \u201cthere\u2019s no truth to [Trump's]\u00a0charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.\u201d Biden also accused the president of throwing \u201clies and distortions and smears\u201d at him and his son, \u201cbecause he thinks he\u2019ll undermine my candidacy for the nomination as well as the presidency if I am the nominee.\u201d While the Fox News national poll released Wednesday indicated that a majority said the president should be impeached and removed from office, Biden has faced warning signs of his own. MAJORITY BACK TRUMP IMPEACHMENT IN LATEST FOX NEWS POLL Thirty-six percent questioned in the survey said they found the Trump allegations against Biden extremely or very troubling. That included 34 percent of independents and even 24 percent of Democrats. Longtime Republican strategist Colin Reed highlighted that \u201cthe discussion involving Ukraine is going to involve a continued focus on why Hunter Biden was being paid $50,000 a month to sit on the board of an energy company with him having absolutely no expertise in that area.\u201d Reed emphasized, \u201cI think that crony capitalism does not sit well with voters in the center, right\u00a0or left.\u201d And, Biden\u2019s increased criticism aimed at the president likely will incite further attacks from Trump. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While the former vice president was speaking in New Hampshire, the president took to Twitter to return fire. \u201cSo pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong. Joe\u2019s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!\u201d Trump wrote.",

The Wall Street Journal first\u00a0reported that lawyers for the anonymous CIA officer have asked lawmakers if the whistleblower could submit testimony in writing, but the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have\u00a0not yet responded. WHISTLEBLOWER LAWYER ACKNOWLEDGES CLIENT HAD 'CONTACT' WITH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES The request comes amid Democrats' desire to\u00a0protect\u00a0the identity\u00a0of the whistleblower, along with worries over safety and media scrutiny. President Trump and Republicans believe the president should have a right to confront his accuser, and have also cited new reports indicating the whistleblower could have partisan motives. His attorneys have acknowledged he is a registered Democrat who has worked with at least one 2020 candidate. On Thursday, reports surfaced that the candidate was Joe Biden. Democrats formally\u00a0launched an impeachment inquiry\u00a0after the\u00a0anonymous whistleblower filed a complaint about President Trump pressing Ukrainian officials this summer to investigate 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s business activities in Ukraine.

In recent tweets, the president has asked, \u201cwhy aren\u2019t we entitled to interview & learn everything about the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all of the false information to him.\u201d During a rally in Minnesota on Thursday night, Trump cited a new report in The Washington Examiner that the whistleblower at the center of Democrats' impeachment push had worked with Biden.

But defeating Schiff in 2020 will be a tall order: Schiff won his race with nearly\u00a078.4 percent of the vote in 2018. \u201cI refer to him (Schiff) as a National Disgrace.\u00a0It is becoming more and more evident that Schiff and his team likely clandestinely worked together with a conflicted and tremendously biased deep state Trump hater to orchestrate this latest outrage to try to destroy a duly elected American president,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat in and of itself should disqualify Schiff from overseeing the so-called \u2018inquiry.\u2019\u201d Holding nothing back when it comes to his condemnation and zingers of his political opponent, Early has also accused Schiff of being something akin to a media hog, which was illuminated by his involvement in the two-year-long Russia investigation. \u201cSchiff appeared on national news shows over 400 times during that period, repeatedly telling every American how he had and had seen evidence that made it clear the president had colluded with the Russians to win the election,\u201d Early continued. \u201cAs the then-ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, Schiff made the world believe that his knowledge was based on among other things, his access to classified information.\u00a0Now Schiff never says the word Russia, but his two straight years of lies will forever be left in the public\u2019s consciousness.\u201d In June, the L.A power attorney for more than 25 years made the bold move to throw his hat into the ring \u2013 having become fed up with Schiff\u2019s continuous \u201clies on TV.\u201d But it is not Early\u2019s first foray into politics. He ran unsuccessfully for California attorney general in 2018 but claims that the experience prepared him for a run against Schiff. \u201cI spoke to people all around California, met many amazing people, received almost a million votes statewide, and thoroughly enjoyed campaigning,\u201d he said. \u201cMy legal background has been great preparation for this role.

      "content": " Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. envoy to Kiev and someone President Trump has privately called \"bad news,\" is scheduled to sit for a potentially explosive transcribed interview with lawmakers and staff on Capitol Hill on Friday as Democrats intensify their impeachment inquiry. But after the White House abruptly\u00a0blocked U.S. Ambassador to the E.U.\u00a0Gordon Sondland from testifying shortly before his planned appearance on Tuesday, it remained unclear whether\u00a0Yovanovitch would appear at all. The White House announced this week it would not comply at all with what it called Democrats' \"unconstitutional\" proceedings. However, multiple sources told Fox News late Thursday that Sondland will\u00a0indeed appear for a transcribed interview before House investigators next Wednesday, defying the State Department. \"Notwithstanding the State Department\u2019s current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees\u2019 subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday,\" read a statement released by Sondland. It also comes amid some internal drama at the State Department. Fox News has confirmed that Michael McKinley, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, resigned this week. As of now, Fox News is told\u00a0that the plan is for only House Intelligence Committee staff and members to pose questions to Yovanovitch, should the ex-diplomat show up as scheduled at 10 a.m. ET. No staffers from the Foreign Affairs or Oversight Committees, majority or minority party, are expected to be able to ask questions. But\u00a0Republicans will be allowed to have a second aide in the room after complaining last time, Fox News is told. It's unclear how long the session is likely to run. HERE'S WHY THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT WON'T COMPLY WITH DEMS' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY Trump and his surrogates have painted Yovanovitch as a rogue State Department employee with an anti-Trump political bias. Her ouster in May came amid alleged attempts by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani to press Ukraine into investigating\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son. Those efforts triggered the impeachment inquiry. The former New York mayor labeled Yovanovitch a political hack bent on undermining Trump's efforts, charges that apparently resonated with the president. On Thursday, federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment alleging in part that two donors to a pro-Trump fundraising committee were engaged in lobbying efforts in the U.S. on behalf of a Ukrainian politician to seek Yovanovitch's ouster. The Soviet-born defendants,\u00a0Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, are U.S. citizens who helped Giuliani's efforts to pursue an investigation of Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine. Meanwhile,\u00a0Ukraine's president insisted Thursday that he faced \"no blackmail\" from Trump in the July 25\u00a0phone call between the two men that led to an impeachment inquiry. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said for the first time that his country will \"happily\" investigate the conspiracy theory pushed by Trump that it was Ukrainians, not Russians, who interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. And he encouraged U.S. and Ukrainian prosecutors to discuss investigating the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings. GIULIANI ASSOCIATES TIED TO UKRAINE PROBES INDICTED ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATIONS Biden\u00a0has acknowledged\u00a0that in spring 2016, when he was vice president and spearheading the Obama administration's Ukraine policy, he successfully pressured\u00a0Ukraine to fire top prosecutor\u00a0Viktor Shokin. At the time, Shokin was investigating\u00a0Burisma Holdings\u00a0\u2014\u00a0where Hunter had a\u00a0lucrative role\u00a0on the board despite limited relevant expertise. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin, who was widely accused of corruption,\u00a0was not fired. The impact of any news from the interview with\u00a0Yovanovitch may be blunted temporarily because both the House and Senate formally remain on recess until next Tuesday. The House Democratic Caucus and Republican Conferences will hold their formal meetings and press conferences on Wednesday morning. Yovanovitch, a State Department employee for 33 years who also led U.S. embassies in Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, has drawn praise from colleagues for her past work on international affairs. She is \"a top-notch diplomat, careful, meticulous, whip-smart,\" and unlikely to have badmouthed Trump, either to Ukrainian officials or her colleagues, said John Herbst, a predecessor as ambassador in Ukraine who worked alongside Yovanovitch there in the early 2000s. That reputation is all but impossible to square with what some view as a smear campaign, capped by the Trump administration's\u00a0removal of Yovanovitch from her post\u00a0this year. BIDEN CAMPAIGN SEEKS TO BAR GIULIANI FROM TV\u00a0...\u00a0THEN GOES AFTER NEW YORK TIMES \"The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news,\" Trump told Ukraine President Zelenskiy during their\u00a0July 25 call, according to a partial transcript released by the White House. \"She's going to go through some things.\" Currently a State Department fellow at Georgetown's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, Yovanovitch was declining all requests to speak with reporters in advance of her planned testimony. Yovanovitch, 60, was raised in a household that helped prepare her for a career in international relations. Born in Canada to immigrant parents \u2014 her father from the former Soviet Union,\u00a0her mother from Germany \u2014 she grew up speaking Russian at home. The family moved to Connecticut when she was a young child, and she later became a U.S. citizen. \"Like so many, including those in the Ukrainian-American community, my parents' lives were changed forever by Communist and Nazi regimes,\" Yovanovitch said during a Senate confirmation hearing in 2016, attended by her 88-year-old mother. \"They survived poverty, war and displacement, and finally arrived in the United States, with me in tow, in search of freedom, opportunity, dignity and accountability.\" Yovanovitch attended Princeton, where she majored in history and Russian studies. She joined the Foreign Service six years later, working as deputy director of the Russian desk before being posted to Canada, Russia, Great Britain and Somalia. From 2001 to 2004, she worked as the U.S. deputy chief of mission in Ukraine, as second in charge to Herbst, before being named ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, then to Armenia. She returned to Ukraine after President Barack Obama nominated her to be ambassador in 2016. FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS RECORD SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT She arrived in Kiev two years after Russia's forced annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and its continuing military intervention. As an envoy, Yovanovitch sought to reassure Ukrainian officials of U.S. support, while\u00a0pushing them to root out widespread\u00a0corruption. \"The old oligarch system is still clinging to life, and corruption is its life support,\" she said in a speech in January to new graduates of the Ukrainian Leadership Academy. \"Ukraine must continue to pursue economic reforms in line with European standards and fully empower all of its anti-corruption institutions.\" Some Ukrainian officials, including the country's top prosecutor, bridled at\u00a0the pressure from the U.S. ambassador. In March, the prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, claimed that Yovanovitch had given him a list of people he should not prosecute. The State Department dismissed the statement as baseless and Lutsenko later recanted his claim. But critics, led by Giuliani, accused her of working to undermine Trump's interests. \"The embassy in Ukraine was a 'Hillary Clinton for president' office. And they were looking to dig up dirt on President Trump,\" Giuliani said. \"There was a lot more collusion with Ukraine than in Russia, where there doesn't appear to be any. They were trying to bring Trump down.\" As part of Senate confirmation hearings to ambassadorial posts, Yovanovitch reported that she made several small contributions to Democratic candidates in the early 2000s, but none more recently. She returned to Washington in 2012 and 2013, serving as the State Department's day-to-day contact with U.S. officials in Europe. Lee Feinstein, the U.S. ambassador to Poland at the time, recalled extended conversations with Yovanovitch about how to calibrate negotiations over missile development and a continuing U.S. military presence there. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"She was always the kind of person who was very, very supportive of her ambassadors and looking to help them do their jobs better,\" said Feinstein, now dean of the Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Relations at Indiana University. \"Never somebody who was trying to pursue her own agenda.\" Fox News' Nick\u00a0Kalman,\u00a0Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said Friday that Democratic lawmakers should get the documents they have subpoenaed from Mazars USA. The firm has provided accounting services to Trump. TRUMP GRANTED REPRIEVE ON TAX RETURN CASE AFTER FEDERAL JUDGE ISSUES BLISTERING RULING Trump\u2019s legal team told Fox News they are \u201creviewing options.\u201d Options include a request for the appeal to be heard \u201cen banc\u201d or, possibly, taking it to the Supreme Court. \u201cWhile we are reviewing the court\u2019s lengthy decision, as well as Judge Rao\u2019s dissent, we continue to believe that this subpoena is not a legitimate exercise of Congress\u2019s legislative authority,\" said Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president. The Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform subpoenaed records from Mazars in April. They include documents from 2011 to 2018 that the House wants for an investigation into the president's reporting of his finances and potential conflicts of interest. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a fundamental and resounding victory for congressional oversight, our Constitutional system of checks and balances, and the rule of law,\" said Elijah Cummings, the Democratic chairman of the committee. \"For far too long, the President has placed his personal interests over the interests of the American people.\" Earlier this year, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, sent a letter to Cummings \u201cstrenuously\u201d objecting to the committee's subpoena. \u201cI urge you to seriously reconsider your intention to issue this subpoena,\u201d Jordan told Cummings at the time. \u201cYour obsession with attacking the president and his family for political gain does nothing to improve the efficiency, economy and operations of the federal government.\u201d Trump appointee Neomi Rao dissented from the three-judge panel's ruling.

      "content": " Two diplomats at the center of the Ukraine controversy are now set to testify before House lawmakers as part of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, despite significant pushback from both the State Department and the White House. Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. envoy to Kiev and someone President Trump has privately called \"bad news,\" arrived on Capitol Hill Friday\u00a0for a potentially explosive transcribed interview with lawmakers and staff. TRUMP ALLED FORMER UKRAINE DIPLOMAT 'BAD NEWS'...AND NOW SHE'S SET TO TESTIFY Trump and his allies have sought to paint Yovanovitch as a rogue employee with an anti-Trump bias. She was ousted in May amid alleged attempts by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani to press Ukraine into investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.\u00a0 Those efforts ultimately led to the impeachment inquiry after the revelation\u00a0of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- in which Trump asked the premier to \u201clook into\u201d the allegations about Biden's conduct in the country. While Yovanovitch, a long-time diplomat, has been praised by her colleagues as a \"top-notch diplomat,\" Trump depicted\u00a0her in the call with Zelensky as \u201cbad news\u201d and someone who is \u201cgoing to go through some things.\u201d Giuliani and other critics have accused her of working to undermine Trump\u2019s interests. Also Friday, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland announced that he will testify before Congress. The announcement comes\u00a0a week after the State Department directed him not to appear before lawmakers at a scheduled deposition. The shift comes after House Democrats on Wednesday subpoenaed him to appear before the joint committees to testify. He said in a statement that he is scheduled to appear on Thursday. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BLOCKS AMBASSADOR FROM TESTIFYING IN HOUSE IMPEACHMENT DEPOSITION \u201cNotwithstanding the State Department\u2019s current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees\u2019 subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday,\u201d the statement said. \"Ambassador Sondland has at all times acted with integrity and in the interests of the United States. He has no agenda apart from answering the Committees\u2019 questions fully and truthfully.\u201d Trump had dismissed the deposition as a \u201ckangaroo court,\u201d while Democrats warned that a failure of Sondland and other witnesses to appear was evidence of obstruction of Congress. \u201cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify,\" Trump tweeted, \"but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see.\" Democrats claim that Trump used $400 million in military aid as leverage in a quid pro quo for the Ukrainians to investigate a political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and opened an impeachment inquiry, firing off a raft of subpoenas within a few days to top administration and White House officials. While a call transcript shows the president urging a Biden-related investigation, Trump denies any 'quid pro quo' claims. Sondland is a wealthy hotelier, philanthropist and contributor to political campaigns. He is a key figure as he had texted with Bill Taylor, a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, arguing over allegations of a quid pro quo. In early September, Taylor wrote: \"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" Days later, he followed up: \"As I said over the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\" Sondland responded, defending the president: \"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\u201d It is not clear how much of the change in Sondland\u2019s position is his own, and how much the Trump administration has shifted on the question of whether he should appear. Axios reported Friday that Republicans close to Trump encouraged the president to let the ambassador come before the committees and that his allies believe Sondland's testimony will be helpful to them. CLICK HERE FOR\u00a0THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM But the White House has been aggressive in its pushback against the impeachment inquiry, which it sees as illegitimate and politically motivated. On Wednesday the White House issued a defiant letter saying it would not cooperate with the inquiry. \"President Trump and his administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process,\" the letter stated.\u00a0\"Your unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice. In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\" Fox News' Gregg Re, Lillian LeCroy, Nick Kalman, Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

What I hear from folks time and time again is nothing meaningful came out of these debates and they\u2019re often disconnected from peoples\u2019 lives,\u201d Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said Friday. Bullock spoke with reporters from Fox News, NBC News, and NPR after headlining the \"Politics and Eggs\"\u00a0speaking series, a must-stop for White House hopefuls in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire. BULLOCK ACCUSES STEYER OF BUYING HIS WAY ONTO DEBATE STAGE Bullock, who launched his campaign in the late spring, qualified for the second round of debates but didn\u2019t reach the Democratic National Committee\u2019s polling and fundraising criteria to make the cut for last month\u2019s showdown or Tuesday\u2019s debate, which will be held in Ohio. The DNC\u2019s raising the thresholds again for candidates to make the stage for November\u2019s fifth round showdown, which will be held in Atlanta. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is in a similar situation. He jumped into the race relatively late and qualified for the first two rounds of debates, but didn\u2019t make the stage last month and won\u2019t be in the debate spotlight next week. \u201cI had to make a decision on the debate stage, whether I was going to keep laundering money through Facebook to try to stay on a debate stage that was pre-season football, that wasn\u2019t going to make a difference in the standings, or whether I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire,\u201d Bennet explained in an interview on Tuesday with Fox News and NHTalkRadio.com. \u201cI decided I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire at a time when they were going to start paying attention to this race,\u201d he emphasized. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Twelve candidates have qualified for Tuesday\u2019s showdown. Bullock, Bennet, and four other contenders in the still extremely large but shrinking field of Democratic White House hopefuls failed to make the cut. Most of the lower-tier candidates have fired away for months at the DNC for their debate criteria, arguing it\u2019s unfair and winnows the field of candidates before voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina \u2013 the first four states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar, get to cast their ballots. A slightly more diplomatic Bullock said on Thursday that \u201cthe DNC was well-intentioned but I don\u2019t think the best example is for campaigns to be spending $50 or $60 to get each individual donor\u2026. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best way to pick a candidate or nominee.\u201d Pushing back against the criticism, DNC Chair Tom Perez told Fox News last month that the process has been \u201ceminently fair\u201d and added \u201cwe\u2019re going \u201cto continue to be transparent.\u201d Rep. Tulsi Gabbard \u00a0- who failed to qualify for last month\u2019s debate but made the stage for next week\u2019s showdown -\u00a0announced on Thursday that she may boycott next Tuesday\u2019s debate. GABBARD THREATENS TO BOYCOTT DEBATE TO PROTEST DNC The congresswoman from Hawaii accused\u00a0the DNC and its\u00a0national media debate partners of \u201crigging\u201d the primary battle against many of the lower-tier candidates and political outsiders running for the nomination. \u201cI am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media\u2019s effort to rig 2020 primary,\u201d she tweeted. Even though he\u2019s not making the stage, Bullock says he\u2019s marching on. He told Fox News he has enough campaign cash to survive until the first votes in the early voting states in February. \u201cWe\u2019re still 120 days out from any voter expressing preference. I still think there\u2019s a lot of time for this,\u201d he stressed. And Bennet took aim at the top-tier contenders for the nomination, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens.

Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He\u2019s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that\u2019s up 6 points and a new high for her.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month. While Biden\u2019s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June. The rundown continues with\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0at 5 percent,\u00a0Pete Buttigieg\u00a0at 4 percent,\u00a0Beto O\u2019Rourke\u00a0at 3 percent, and\u00a0Cory Booker,\u00a0Amy Klobuchar\u00a0and\u00a0Andrew Yang\u00a0each at 2 percent.\u00a0Michael Bennet,\u00a0Julian Castro,\u00a0Tulsi Gabbard,\u00a0Tim Ryan,\u00a0Tom Steyer, and\u00a0Marianne Williamson\u00a0receive 1 percent apiece.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s firewall still strong -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201c[Contrary] to the expectations of analysts, the fears of supporters and the hopes of rivals, Biden maintains a sizable loyal following. Nowhere is that more evident than in the African American community, recent interviews suggest, especially in states like South Carolina, which holds a crucial early primary.\u00a0Martha Beck, a retired high school teacher from Charleston \u2026 gushed about Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but said Sanders is \u2018too old and grumpy and he just shouts at people all the time.\u2019 And she doesn\u2019t think the same country that elected [Donald] Trump would put Warren, or any other woman, in the White House four years later.\u201d\n\nWill any Dem dare mention the swampy stuff? -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the one question about impeachment that no Democratic presidential candidate wants to answer head on. Should Joe Biden\u2019s son\u00a0Hunter\u00a0have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president? In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son\u2019s work and his service as vice president. \u2026 So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. \u2026 In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden\u2019s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback. The questions surrounding his son may be even more sensitive\u2026 Echoing an attack introduced and continually leveraged \u2014 in false ways \u2014 by Mr. Trump could risk raising Democrats\u2019 ire.\u201d\n\nJane Sanders takes starring role in husband\u2019s campaign -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife,\u00a0Jane Sanders. \u2026 When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders \u2026 stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, \u2018especially me,\u2019 had told him to slow down. \u2026 In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be \u2018egotistical\u2019 to call herself Mr. Sanders\u2019s top adviser but allowed that she was \u2018very much a close adviser.\u2019 Above all, she said, she was \u2018his wife.\u2019\u201d\n\nVoter intensity on both sides through the roof -\u00a0Gallup:\u00a0\u201cA year before the 2020 presidential election, roughly seven in 10 Democrats and Republicans say they have given \u2018quite a lot of thought\u2019 to the election. About half of political independents have done so. The lack of a Republican-Democratic difference in thought given to the election is notable because Republicans usually have an advantage over Democrats, including in each of the past seven final presidential pre-election surveys, as well as in most surveys conducted throughout presidential election years historically. The current results are based on combined data from interviews with more than 2,400 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, conducted between Aug. 15 and Sept. 30, 2019. Gallup has measured thought given to the election since 1952, and it has shown a relationship to actual voter turnout among all Americans in past elections.\u201d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: CLOAK AND DAGGER\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever nature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are sometimes requisite. These are cases where the most useful intelligence may be obtained, if the persons possessing it can be relieved from apprehensions of discovery.\u201d \u2013\u00a0John Jay,\u00a0Federalist No. 64\n\nTIME OUT: \u2018A STATUE OF FLORENTINE BRONZE\u2019\nParis Review:\u00a0\u201cIn the late summer of 1866, a black equestrian stuntwoman made her Paris debut and galvanized the city. She was known only as \u2018Sarah the African,\u2019 and history has left us few traces of her: just some battered posters, inky clippings, and burlesque scripts. Sarah was, in the words of the men who wrote about her, \u2018the finest horsewoman of the King of Morocco,\u2019 \u2018an Ethiopian,\u2019 or \u2018a statue of Florentine bronze.\u2019 A \u2018negress\u2019 who performed as neither slave nor clown, whose name evoked\u00a0Sarah Baartman, the Khoikhoi woman dissected by\u00a0Georges Cuvier\u00a0just a few decades before in Paris, and Selika, the queen heroine of Meyerbeer\u2019s hit posthumous opera,\u00a0L\u2019Africaine. She was a woman named for a whole continent. \u2026 On her debut in September she was billed above M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s the bareback horse, above a race of forty horses all mounted by women, above the rubber horseman,\u00a0William Meyer, and even above\u00a0Mlle Ad\u00e8le, who made her Sidy-Laraby dance with no reins.\u201d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\nBiden:\u00a028 points (\u2191\u00a01.2 points from last wk.)\nWarren:\u00a026.2 points (\u2191 3.4 points from last wk.)\nSanders:\u00a014.4 points (\u2193\u00a01.6 points\u00a0from last wk.)\nButtigieg:\u00a05.4 points (\u2193\u00a00.6 points from last wk.)\nHarris:\u00a04.2 points (\u2193\u00a01.4 points\u00a0from last wk.)\n\n[Averages include: Fox News, Quinnipiac University, IBD, Monmouth University and NBC News/WSJ.]\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a042.8 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00a053.4 percent\nNet Score:\u00a0-10.6 percent\nChange from one week ago:\u00a0\u2191\u00a00.4 points\n\n[Average includes: NPR/PBS/Marist: 45% approve - 51% disapprove; Fox News: 43% approve - 55% disapprove; NBC/WSJ: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 40% approve - 54% disapprove; IBD: 43% approve - 54% disapprove.]\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00a0\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

They have been named as witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI's New York field office and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, the same U.S. Attorney's office Giuliani ran before he became mayor of New York.\u201d\n\nFormer Ambassador to Ukraine cites Giuliani pressure campaign -\u00a0AP: \u201cFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine\u00a0Marie Yovanovitch\u00a0told lawmakers Friday that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to oust her from her position. Yovanovitch said in an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press that she was \u2018abruptly\u2019 recalled in May and told the president had lost confidence in her. She said she was told by an official that there was a \u2018concerted campaign against me\u2019 and that Trump had pressured officials to remove her for almost a year. \u2018Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,\u2019 Yovanovitch wrote in the statement.\u201d\n\nReport: Trump pushed Tillerson to help a Giuliani client -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201cPresident Trump sought to enlist then-Secretary of State\u00a0Rex Tillerson\u00a0in the fall of 2017 to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani to help stop the prosecution of a Turkish Iranian gold trader represented by the former New York mayor, according to people with knowledge of the request. Trump urged Tillerson in an Oval Office meeting to try to craft a diplomatic \u2018deal\u2019 to stop the U.S. case against\u00a0Reza Zarrab\u00a0on corruption charges in exchange for concessions from Turkey. The request shocked the then-secretary of state, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the president. At the time, Turkish President\u00a0Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00a0was personally lobbying Trump to get the charges dropped. Trump, in turn, repeatedly raised the topic with Tillerson \u2014 including directly in the Oval Office meeting, according to people with knowledge of the episode.\u201d\n\nPete Session\u2019s political revival threatened by Ukraine role -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cFormer Representative\u00a0Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who is seeking a return to Congress, was caught in the fallout of the Ukraine scandal on Thursday when he was referred to in the indictment of two presidential allies accused of campaign finance allegations. Mr. Sessions, who served 11 terms in Congress until he was swept out last year, is described as \u2018Congressman-1\u2019 in the indictment of\u00a0Lev Parnas\u00a0and\u00a0Igor Fruman, who were arrested and charged on Thursday with illegally funneling foreign money to American political candidates and campaigns. The two men are associates of\u00a0Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2026 Mr. Sessions\u2019s appearance in the indictment, which was filed just a week after he announced he would run for Congress in 2020, was an early and potentially damaging blow to his campaign. Mr. Sessions is not named in the indictment, nor is he accused of any wrongdoing. On Thursday, he issued a statement that denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by federal prosecutors.\u201d\n\nContinetti: We are all Ukrainians -\u00a0Free Beacon:\u00a0\u201cFrom Varsity Blues to Jeffrey Epstein, from China and the NBA to Ukraine and Hunter Biden, Americans are taking a crash course on the ways in which powerful people manipulate the system for personal advantage and globalization merges political cultures as well as economies. What has been uncovered as impeachment rolls on does nothing to spur confidence in the integrity of our system. America is exceptional, but our elites are not. Today we are all Ukrainians.\u201d\n\nTRUMP LEGAL TEAM TRASHES GOWDY\nYahoo:\u00a0\u201cThe president\u2019s decision to bulk up his legal team with former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy amid a widening impeachment inquiry is drawing criticism from one of his high-profile supporters. On Wednesday morning, the day after news leaked that Gowdy was set to serve as outside counsel to the president,\u00a0Victoria Toensing, a veteran Washington lawyer who has been working with Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, expressed concern and disbelief that the onetime advocate for congressional oversight would be coming onboard.\u00a0\u2018Trey Gowdy doesn\u2019t know s***,\u2019 she said. \u2026 \u2018He screwed up the Benghazi hearings, and he came out with the advice to Trump, \u2018Well, if you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, just talk to\u00a0Bob Mueller.\u2019\u2019 Toensing and her husband,\u00a0Joe diGenova, work with Giuliani though they are not officially on Trump\u2019s legal team.\u201d\n\nAnd he can\u2019t even join until January -\u00a0WashEx:\u00a0\u201cFormer Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy\u00a0cannot join President Trump's legal team until early next year, the president announced Thursday. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump said, \u2018Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy. I think there\u2019s a problem with, he can\u2019t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations.\u2019 It was only a day after\u00a0Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, announced Gowdy had joined the team to assist with the response to the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. \u2026\u00a0Gowdy, 55, is a former federal prosecutor who retired from Congress on Jan. 3 after representing the 4th Congressional District of South Carolina for four terms. He then rejoined his old white-collar law firm, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough. Despite his return to the legal profession,\u00a0federal law\u00a0prevents Gowdy from taking on Trump as a client in the impeachment fight until Jan. 3, 2020.\u201d DEMS DIVIDED ON TIMING OF IMPEACHMENT VOTE\nPolitico:\u00a0\u201cHouse Democrats are grappling with whether to take more steps to formalize their impeachment inquiry and silence a chief Republican criticism of their efforts, with competing factions beginning to emerge. President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill have hammered Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0for not holding a vote authorizing the House\u2019s impeachment proceedings \u2014 arguing that without a vote, the entire process is illegitimate.\u00a0Pelosi has refused to cave, dismissing Trump\u2019s demand last week and insisting it is not required under the Constitution or House rules. And allies close to the speaker say her position hasn\u2019t changed, describing the idea as the latest \u2018Republican canard\u2019 in a series of stall tactics the GOP will employ to protect Trump. \u2026 Yet some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, publicly \u2014 that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point. The debate is threatening to cleave Democrats\u2019 unified front as the White House makes the arcane procedural arguments the centerpiece of its impeachment defense.\u201d\n\nHouse members get an earful from voters back home -\u00a0Politico:\u00a0\u201cThe \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 hats were in the front row Thursday night at freshman Rep.\u00a0Anthony Brindisi\u2019s first town hall event since Speaker Nancy Pelosi blessed an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. But for all the criticism the centrist Democrat faced from pro-Trump voters, the sharper questions came from his own supporters about why he is one of just seven in his caucus who has refused to endorse the impeachment push. \u2026 Swing-district Democrats doggedly avoided the impeachment debate when they first got to Washington. Now they can\u2019t avoid it. \u2026 But at dozens of town halls over the two-week recess, Brindisi and other vulnerable freshmen had to fend for themselves \u2014 serving as the party\u2019s on-the-ground voices on impeachment. Whether they can deliver a message that resonates could determine Democrats\u2019 chances of winning over the public and holding on to their seats and the House majority in 2020.\u201d\n\nIndependents\u2019 support for impeachment jumps 10 points -\u00a0NPR:\u00a0\u201cA slim majority of Americans now approve of the Democratic House-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Fifty-two percent say they approve of the inquiry, while 43% disapprove. That's a slight increase in support from two weeks ago, when 49% approved and 46% disapproved. The numbers are in line with other polls that have been released this week also showing majority support or an increase in support for the inquiry. The uptick in support in the NPR poll comes mostly from a swing among independents. In late September, more independents disapproved of the inquiry than approved, by a 50-44% margin. Now, in a reversal, more independents approve of the inquiry than disapprove, by a 54-41% margin, a net change of 19 points. On the questions of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, Americans are split \u2014 49-47% in favor of impeachment and 48-48% on whether the Senate should vote to remove him.\u201d\n\nROMNEY STEPS UP HIS ROLE FOR GOP\nPolitico:\u00a0\u201cPresident Donald Trump wants to sideline\u00a0Mitt Romney\u00a0\u2014 but the Utah senator isn\u2019t having it. Even as he faces a barrage of attacks from the president and his allies, Romney is mapping out plans to play a central role in 2020 \u2014 headlining party events, shelling out cash from his campaign war chest, and hitting up his donor network for vulnerable senators on the ballot next year.Later this month, Romney will take his most aggressive step yet to insert himself into the 2020 campaign when he hosts a New York City fundraiser for Maine Sen.\u00a0Susan Collins, Colorado Sen.\u00a0Cory Gardner\u00a0and Michigan Senate hopeful\u00a0John James. All are establishment-aligned figures confronting tough races in swing states. Behind the scenes, Romney\u2019s team has also begun directing his donors to help GOP candidates in Senate battlegrounds. Romney aides say he's always intended to help in competitive Senate races and that his desire to do so has never been influenced by Trump\u2019s efforts to ostracize him.\u201d\n\nDems eye Chelsea Clinton for New York House seat -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cMs. [Nita]\u00a0Lowey\u2019s announcement set off a wave of speculation about other potential contenders, including\u00a0Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President\u00a0Bill Clinton\u00a0and\u00a0Hillary Clinton, as well as a state assemblyman,\u00a0David Buchwald. Last year, when asked if she envisioned running for elected office, Chelsea Clinton told The Journal News, which covers the Hudson Valley, that \u2018if someone were to step down or retire,\u2019 she would \u2018have to think if it\u2019s the right choice for me.\u2019 Ms. Clinton did not mention any particular office, although she is clearly familiar with Ms. Lowey\u2019s district: Her parents\u2019 house in Chappaqua, N.Y., is in the district. Ms. Clinton herself does not live in Westchester, but congressional candidates are not required to live in the district they represent. A representative for Ms. Clinton did not return a request for comment. Mr. Buchwald said he would make an announcement within a few days.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez draws credible primary challenger -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cA prominent New York City Democrat filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) Thursday to launch a primary challenge for the House of Representatives seat currently held by Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y. City Council member\u00a0Fernando Cabrera\u00a0said he believes a moderate Democrat such as himself could beat the socialist Ocasio-Cortez. He plans to target her far-left views and highlight his belief that she is a \u2018no show\u2019 in the district. \u2018Only a Democrat is going to be able to defeat her, and it\u2019s going to be a moderate Democrat,\u2019 Cabrera, who represents a Bronx City Council district, told Politico. \u2018She\u2019s a no-show in the district. She hasn\u2019t brought about anything except division within the party.\u2019 \u2018Socialism doesn\u2019t work,\u2019 Cabrera added.\u201d\n\nPompeo ally steps aside in Kansas Senate race -\u00a0The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle:\u00a0\u201cA Kansas business leader with longtime ties to Mike Pompeo will not run for U.S. Senate after weighing a bid for months \u2014 renewing speculation about whether the secretary of state will enter the race.\u00a0Alan Cobb, the president and CEO of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, in the past has said he would defer to Pompeo if the chief diplomat decided to mount a campaign. Cobb, a former Koch Industries lobbyist, advised Pompeo in 2014 during a congressional primary battle against former Rep.\u00a0Todd Tiahrt. He made no mention of Pompeo in a lengthy statement Thursday announcing his decision. Cobb said that \u2018after months of serious deliberation, analysis, and careful and prayerful consideration with friends, colleagues and my family, I have decided that the best place for me to pursue my passion is to remain as the President and CEO of the Kansas Chamber.\u2019\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nIt was the foreign policy he promised, but Trump still pays price -\u00a0NYT\n\nLocations and dates for 2020 general election debates announced Friday\u00a0-\u00a0CPD Judges rule in favor of House Dems seeking Trump\u2019s tax returns\u00a0-\u00a0NYT\n\nRead this: The pen pal who changed a president\u00a0-\u00a0Narratively\n\nReese\u2019s dominates Halloween candy favorites poll-\u00a0Monmouth University\n\nAUDIBLE: YOU DO YOU\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that\u2026 And I\u2019m going to say, then just marry one woman.

I understand the following: Trump has proclaimed that he is pulling troops from Syria after what has been a long involvement (partnering) with the Kurds. But, that doesn\u2019t happen overnight, right? Once Trump announced the pulling of troops, Turkey is waiting on the sideline frothing at the chance to attack. They then attack, even with threats from Trump that they better not or there will once again be sanctions. Now the number of Kurds killed are rolling in, but are our troops still there? If they are, what are they doing? Is there something that Trump picked up on that is going on with the Kurds? The conspiracist side of me thinks he sniffed something out. My husband is an Iowa farmer and I work in crop insurance. We don\u2019t have many ties to the military but sure understand how government a lot of the time just doesn\u2019t make sense. Any insight would be appreciated.\u201d \u2013\u00a0E\u2019Lise Bracker, Underwood, Iowa\n\n\n[Ed. note: No conspiracy here, Ms. Bracker. The number of U.S. troops in the disputed area was very small \u2013 measured in dozens. They were not a credible threat in terms of actually combating Turkey\u2019s forces but rather something of a marker. By having the troops there, we were telling the Turks to stay out and leave our Kurdish allies alone. It was a small-scale version of the U.S. forces in South Korea: To fight, the Turks would have had to kill Americans, thereby bring our military down on their heads. Upon the president\u2019s order, the U.S. troops were quickly out of the Turks\u2019 zone of aggression. The Americans went to Iraq and other U.S. spots in the region, clearing the way for the Turks to start pummeling their ancient Kurdish enemies.]\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI am a huge fan of the Halftime Report and never miss it! Your struggle to remain fairly balanced is appreciated, especially by this reader who also struggles mightily to find truth and facts amid the bias and innuendo currently being passed off as \u2018news.\u2019\u00a0 But I am confused by most of the polls' questions (especially the polls you quote) that seem to ask a compound question: Do you favor impeachment and removal of President Trump? I was under the impression that these are two distinct question.\u00a0 That impeachment is like a grand jury investigation, i.e. a procedure (in the House) designed to decide whether there are grounds for a trial (by the Senate) to decide if removal is warranted or not. Am I wrong?\u00a0 Please explain!\u00a0 And keep up the good work!!!\u201d \u2013\u00a0Tom Scherer, Udon Thani, Thailand\n\n\n[Ed. note: This is an excellent question, Mr. Scherer! Different pollsters do indeed ask these questions in different ways. The complexity of the situation is partly to blame. An \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d is not a thing. It\u2019s like a couple being \u201cpre-engaged.\u201d But some pollsters have been asking about it, which tends to screw things up. Getting respondents to differentiate between an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d and \u201cimpeachment\u201d is quite a lot of hair-splitting for civilians. Our poll does it the right way (obvi) and asks whether voters support impeachment, impeachment and removal or no impeachment. Those are the three constitutional possibilities. In\u00a0our poll, 4 percent of respondents said they wanted the president impeached but not removed. That adds up to 55 percent favoring impeachment and 51 percent favoring removal.]\n\n\n\u201cAll my teams have long gone home for the winter. So now we have your traditional Nine in the form of the quite surprising Cardinals playing your hometown Nationals (who should be the Senators and in the American League with Walter Johnson throwing flames, but oh, well). Where do your loyalties lie?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Mary Carol Miller, Greenwood, Miss.\n\n\n[Ed. note: Hometown!? Washington, D.C.!? My place of residence, certainly. And I do love living here. But c\u2019mon, Doc! My hometown is Wheeling, W.Va. and the Cardinals, whose order I lustily joined as a boy when my family moved to St. Louis for four years, are my baseball team.

The country's highest diplomat told the American Association of Christian Counselors in Nashville, Tenn. he wished the NBA would call foul on China's human rights abuses. MAN WHO HAD PRO-HONG KONG SIGN CONFISCATED AT NBA GAME IN WASHINGTON SAYS LEAGUE IS 'AFRAID' OF CHINA \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party is detaining and abusing more than 1\u00a0million Uighur Muslims in internment camps in the Xinjiang region of China. The pages of George Orwell\u2019s 1984 are coming to life there. I wish the NBA would acknowledge that,\u201d Pompeo said Friday. The NBA's starts and coaches have been uncomfortable, unwilling or unable to discuss the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and\u00a0mainland China's human rights abuses, and now the league is shutting down discussion altogether. STEVE KERR SAYS HE HASN'T BEEN ASKED ABOUT US 'HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES' WHEN ASKED ABOUT CHINA The league announced Friday it will not hold any media availability for the rest of its Chinese\u00a0jaunt, a day after Beijing prohibited any kind of news conference before or after a preseason exhibition game between the\u00a0Los Angeles Lakers\u00a0and the\u00a0Brooklyn Nets. \u201cWe have decided not to hold media availability for our teams for the remainder of our trip in China,\u201d the league said in a statement. \u201cThey have been placed into a complicated and unprecedented situation while abroad and we believe it would be unfair to ask them to address these matters in real-time.\u201d The NBA made the decision independent of the Chinese government,\u00a0ESPN\u00a0reported. ANDREW YANG RIPS CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S 'RIDICULOUS' DECISION NOT TO BROADCAST NBA GAMES The tension between the league and China started earlier this week after Houston Rockets\u2019 general manager Daryl Morey tweeted from his personal account a pro-Hong Kong message ahead of the Rockets'\u00a0own preseason trip to Japan. The NBA has tried to do damage control but instead has only caused more outrage by appearing to abandon western values to placate China. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM The league took more heat Thursday after a Rockets official shut down a CNN reporter\u2019s question --about the fallout from the tweet --to stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook. The league later apologized for the incident.

      "content": " Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., became the latest high-ranking target\u00a0of two notorious Russian pranksters who have been fooling politicians into thinking they're foreign officials. Alexey Stolyarov and Vladimir Kuznetsov, two radio hosts who also pranked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in 2018, managed to reach\u00a0Graham by phone and successfully impersonate Turkey's defense minister. Graham relayed President Trump's diplomatic interests offered to the senator during a private conversation between the two. None of the information appeared to be sensitive enough to raise concerns. Audio of the call, first released by Politico, showed\u00a0Graham repeatedly assuring the pranksters of Trump's interest in military and economic cooperation with Turkey -- specifically mentioning efforts towards\u00a0a free trade agreement and restoring Turkey's position in a joint airstrike fighter program. \"The president told me to tell President Erdogan that he wants to turn the discussion to a free trade agreement,\" Graham said at one point during the conversation.\u00a0He proceeded to offer to arrange a call between the two leaders about trade, something he hoped would strengthen relations as the threat of U.S. sanctions loomed over Turkey's decision to install a Russian missile defense system. TURKEY'S SYRIA ASSAULT TRIGGERS WAR WITHIN GOP, AS TRUMP BATTLES NEOCON WING Fox News was able to confirm the call with Graham's office. \"We have been successful in stopping many efforts to prank Senator Graham and the office, but this one slipped through the cracks,\" Kevin Bishop, Graham's communications director, said in a statement provided to Fox News. \"They got him.\" Graham serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has become a key figure in working the president on foreign policy. Initially opposed to Trump\u00a0in 2016, Graham has become an outspoken supporter of Trump's approach to Israel and North Korea.\u00a0 That August call came shortly before Trump caused an apparent rift with Graham by deciding to pull U.S. troops out of Syria\u00a0in October. Graham and other Republicans have criticized that decision as a permission slip\u00a0for Turkey to enter the war-torn nation and slaughter Kurdish allies with impunity. Despite their disagreement, Graham continued defending Trump against House Democrats accusing him of pressuring Ukraine's government to interfere in a foreign election. Trump aides have countered by suggesting that Schiff -- one of the chief Democrats pursuing the House's impeachment inquiry -- was willing to influence the 2020 election during a separate call with Russian pranksters. In a\u00a0clip posted by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Schiff\u00a0told\u00a0the Russian pranksters\u00a0that he would be willing to accept dirt on Trump from Ukraine. Stolyarov and Kuznetsov had posed as Andriy Parubiy, the former speaker of\u00a0Ukraine's parliament, while offering recordings of a Russian journalist and Russian model discussing compromising information about Trump. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Schiff and Graham weren't the only politicians to get tricked into believing they were talking to prominent politicians. The president himself spoke to comedian John Melendez, apparently thinking he was speaking with Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J. \"I find it astounding that the news media's not picking up the fact that I totally duped the president & got in touch... within in less than 2 hours while he was on Air Force One,\" Melendez tweeted in June of 2018.",

      "content": " Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told lawmakers behind closed doors Friday that she was recalled earlier this year after \u201cunfounded and false claims\u201d against her, as well as continued pressure from President Trump on the State Department to remove her -- as she denied being \u201cdisloyal\u201d to the president. \u201cAlthough I understand that I served at the pleasure of the President, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,\u201d she said in a scathing account of the way she was removed from her post. TOP DIPLOMATS TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS DESPITE OPPOSITION FROM STATE DEPT., WHITE HOUSE Yovanovitch, who was recalled in May, spoke as part of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into\u00a0Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- in which Trump asked the premier to \u201clook into\u201d the allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s conduct in the country. Trump, and his top attorney Rudy Giuliani, have focused on Biden\u2019s pressuring of Ukraine to fire in 2016 a top prosecutor who had been looking into Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings, on whose board Biden\u2019s son Hunter sat. The content of that call, revealed in a whistleblower complaint and a transcript also released by the White House, has led Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s conduct. In that call, Trump described Yovanovitch as \u201cbad news.\u201d Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and other critics have accused her of working to undermine Trump\u2019s interests in the region.\u00a0But in her prepared remarks, obtained by Fox News, she denied asking any Ukrainian official to refrain from investigating corruption, and said it was \u201cfictitious\u201d that she was disloyal to the president. \u201cI have heard the allegation in the media that I supposedly told the Embassy team to ignore the President\u2019s orders \u2018since he was going to be impeached.\u2019 That allegation is false. I have never said such a thing, to my Embassy colleagues or to anyone else,\u201d she said. She also denies that the Obama administration asked her to harm the Trump campaign, or to help Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, and said that she has never met Hunter Biden. TWO GIULIANI ASSOCIATED LINKED TO UKRAINE INVESTIGATIONS INDICTED ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE CHARGES \u201cAnd although I have met former Vice President Joe Biden several times over the course of our many years in government, neither he nor the previous Administration ever, directly or indirectly, raised the issue of either Burisma or Hunter Biden with me,\u201d she said. As for Giuliani, she said she was in contact with him three times as she can recall, none related to the controversy at hand -- and said that she did not know Giuliani\u2019s motives for going after her. \u201cBut individuals who may have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine,\u201d she said. That remark appeared to refer to the two associates\u00a0of Giuliani who have been linked to his investigations in Ukraine, and who were indicted for campaign finance violations after being stopped at Dulles International Airport in Virginia on Wednesday. Yovanovitch told lawmakers that she was told in April, just a month after her tour was extended a month before, to return \u201con the next plane.\u201d She then recalled a conversation with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who she says told her Trump had lost confidence in her after a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d and that he had been pressuring the department to remove her\u00a0since the summer of 2018. In her remarks, she said that the State Department had been attacked and hollowed out, and she predicted harm to the nation\u2019s interests. \u201cThe harm will come when private interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good,\u201d she said. \u201cThe harm will come when bad actors in countries beyond Ukraine see how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system.\u201d Her statement revealed no new details about the circumstances surrounding Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky about Biden. Trump has said he was investigating corruption, while Democrats have accused him of using U.S. military aid as a quid pro quo for an investigation into a political rival. On Friday, Democrats also accused the State Department of directing Yovanovitch not to appear before lawmakers. CLICK HERE FOR\u00a0THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM \"This is the latest example of the Administration\u2019s efforts to conceal the facts from the American people and obstruct our lawful and constitutionally-authorized impeachment inquiry,\" Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff., D-Calif., Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said in a statement. Yovanovitch is not the only diplomat who will face lawmakers in the coming days. On Friday, E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland announced that he would comply with a subpoena and testify next week, despite objections from the State Department.

      "content": " A federal judge on Friday blocked a Trump administration rule that sought to strengthen the ability of federal officials to deny green cards to immigrants deemed likely to rely on government assistance -- the latest defeat for the administration's aggressive immigration policy in the courts. Judge George B. Daniels issued a preliminary nationwide injunction, stopping the rule from taking effect on Oct. 15. New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who was part of the lawsuit, along with New York City and the states of Vermont and Connecticut, welcomed the decision. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BOOSTS ABILITY TO DENY GREEN CARDS TO IMMIGRANTS USING WELFARE PROGRAMS \u201cOnce again, the courts have thwarted the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to enact rules that violate both our laws and our values, sending a loud and clear message that they cannot rewrite our story to meet their agenda,\u201d James said in a statement. \"This rule would have had devastating impacts on all New Yorkers \u2013 citizens and noncitizens alike \u2013 and today\u2019s decision is a critical step in our efforts to uphold the rule of law.\u201d While a \u201cpublic charge\u201d inadmissibility standard has long been part of U.S. immigration law, it had not been formally defined by\u00a0statute. The rule, announced by U.S. Immigration and Citizenship Services in August, would have defined a \u201cpublic charge\u201d as an immigrant who received one or\u00a0more designated benefits for more than 12 months within a 36-month period. \u201cThe principle driving it is an old American value, and that\u2019s self-sufficiency,\u201d USCIS\u00a0Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli told Fox News in an interview in August. \u201cIt\u2019s a core principle -- the American Dream itself -- and it\u2019s one of the things that distinguishes us, and it's central to the legal history in the U.S. back into the 1800s.\u201d Those benefits that would be designated\u00a0included\u00a0Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), as well as most forms of Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),\u00a0commonly known as food stamps. The rule expands the number of benefits that can be considered from interim guidance issued in 1999. ICE CHIEF WARNS COURT RULING BARRING DATABASE ACCESS ENDANGERS PUBLIC, RIPS 'JUDICIAL OVERREACH' But Judge Daniels'\u00a0ruling said that the government had failed to provide a reasonable explanation for changing the definition of public charge. Daniels also objected to the government\u2019s inclusion of English proficiency as a sign of self-sufficiency. \u201c\"The United States of America has no official language. Many\u00a0if not most, immigrants who arrived at these shores did not speak English,\" he wrote. He went on to claim that the definition has \u201cno support in the history of U.S. immigration law\u201d and described the rule as \"repugnant.\" \"The rule is simply a new agency policy of exclusion in search of justification. It is repugnant to the American Dream of the opportunity for prosperity and success through hard work and upward mobility,\u201d he wrote. Cuccinelli responded to the ruling by predicting that the administration would ultimately prevail, arguing that \"an objective judiciary will see this rule lies squarely within long-held existing law.\" \"Longstanding federal law requires aliens to rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, sponsors, and private organizations in their communities to succeed,\" he said in a statement. \"The public charge regulation defines this law to ensure those seeking to come or stay in the U.S. can successfully support themselves financially and will not rely on public benefits as they seek opportunity here.\" CLICK HERE FOR\u00a0 THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM The legal defeat is the latest in a series of setbacks for the administration on immigration policy -- where it has faced legal defeats on both legal and illegal immigration. Trump last week issued a presidential proclamation that would require immigrant visa applicants to prove that they have health insurance, or the financial means to cover reasonable health care costs. That proclamation, scheduled to go into effect Nov. 3, was also expected to be hit by a legal challenge. The moves by the administration\u00a0have faced fierce opposition from immigrant activists, as well as many Democrats --\u00a0who have opposed measures to limit welfare for immigrants, while also calling for the extension of various forms of government aid to illegal immigrants as well.

      "content": " LOS ANGELES --\u00a0Many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are calling for sweeping affordable housing plans to address the chronic issue of homelessness, but advocates on the ground who see the issue up close say it doesn\u2019t go far enough and they wish candidates would assign it more urgency. Homelessness in Los Angeles County and across Western states is skyrocketing. In 2019 so far, the number of homeless residents in Los Angeles has risen 12 percent from 2018, according to county statistics. \u201cWe need a FEMA-like, Red Cross-like, National Guard-like [solution],\" said\u00a0Rev. Andy Bales, the CEO of L.A.\u2019s largest homeless shelter, Union Rescue Mission. \"Army Corps of Engineers needs to come and we need to figure out immediately how to get 44,000 people off the streets.\" Candidate plans that are more forward-looking, like five to 10\u00a0years down the road with millions of dollars in investment in affordable housing units, can be good in theory and are necessary, these advocates say, but don\u2019t address \u201cchronic\u201d homelessness, or those who have lived out on the streets for six months or more in the past year. HOMELESS MAN RANDOMLY PICKS UP 6-YEAR-OLD, SLAMS HIM ON CONCRETE: REPORT \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing $600,000 to $700,000 per person, per unit, and it\u2019s planned over the next 10 years and that will not get it done,\u201d Bales says. He added\u00a0that only one candidate has reached out to him on how to remedy the situation. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary under President Obama Julian Castro and Beto O\u2019 Rourke have actually visited homeless encampments on Skid Row, a notoriously expansive homeless encampment in downtown Los Angeles. O\u2019Rourke released a plan this week similar to Castro\u2019s and Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u2019 plans,\u00a0saying he wants to triple funding for homeless assistance grants through HUD providing $50 billion over the next 10 years, fully funding housing choice vouchers, capping rent increases, and pumping investment in dilapidated public housing units. But for those who study the issue of homelessness, they say the problem should be coming up more in candidate rhetoric and dialogue as they campaign. It\u2019s not so much to just have a job to maintain housing, they say, because rent prices have become so unsustainable. \u201cI think it\u2019s becoming an intractable issue because we don\u2019t have the investment and broader solutions to homelessness, which is why I think many of the presidential candidates are focused on affordable housing\u2026.it\u2019s still something that\u2019s just emerging and most of the candidates have not yet addressed,\" said Christopher Herring, a UCLA PhD student. Herring said affordable housing is the main way to go, but there needs to be more steps done to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place and notes that with Castro and Sanders\u2019 plans, respectively, much of the dollar figures they\u2019re proposing will be spent quickly and frivolously unless backed up by creating and maintaining affordable housing quickly and cost-efficiently. \"To put it another way, that expansion of the billions of dollars for homelessness in Castro and Sanders plans will be pissed away quickly and a waste of taxpayer money if not backed up by more robust structural reform in the production and preservation of affordable housing.\" TOMI LAHREN: CA DEMOCRATS IGNORING HOMELESS 'EPIDEMIC' IN FAVOR OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PUSH California\u2019s Democratic primary will be early in 2020, moving up to March from June, making the state in play again for candidates vying for the nomination with 500 delegates up for grabs. Voters in the state have homelessness high on their list of issues. Some in Los Angeles county say it even trumps traffic and the environment in what needs to be fixed first in the city. But ultimately, homeless people have very little, if any political power as a constituency, which could be why voters haven\u2019t heard about the problem in states other than California. \u201cFor the most part, the people who are experiencing homelessness are not voting, at least they\u2019re not voting en masse, they don\u2019t have a strong political voice, they don\u2019t have political champions, and elected officials who are sensitive to what their constituents want or else they\u2019re going to get voted out of office, it\u2019s not a constituency they have to pay a lot of attention to,\u201d said Adam Murray, executive director of LA\u2019s Inner City Law Center. California senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris is supporting a bill in the Senate to provide $13 billion in emergency relief to areas affected by chronic homelessness over the next five years. But Republicans are unlikely to bring it up for a vote, citing the huge price tag. Harris has blamed the Trump administration for cutting off funding to support what local government needs around affordable housing. President Trump, on the other hand, has spoken about the issue on Twitter and at his rallies numerous times, largely in irreverent tones. At a rally in Cincinnati in August, he said, \"What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country...It's a shame. The world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible conditions. Look at San Francisco, look at some of your other cities.\" Herring says California needs a federal response like what Trump is suggesting, saying, \"Trump has drawn attention to this and it\u2019s woken up the Democratic candidates to putting forward and putting pressure on them to make real solutions.\u201d",

      "content": " A divided federal appeals court panel ruled Friday\u00a0that\u00a0Ohio cannot enforce a 2017 law banning abortions when medical tests show the baby has Down syndrome. The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati upheld a preliminary injunction saying that the law was invalid because it had the purpose and effect of preventing some women from obtaining pre-viability abortions, which violates\u00a0Supreme Court precedents. Signed into law by then-Gov. John Kasich in 2017, the measure imposed\u00a0criminal penalties on doctors who perform abortions after learning of a fetal\u00a0diagnosis of Down syndrome. In February\u00a02018, the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio filed suit to block the law from taking effect. One month later, U.S. District Court Judge Timothy S. Black halted the law, saying it violated a woman\u2019s right to privacy. TRUMP TO NAME STATE DEPT. OFFICIAL JOHN SULLIVAN AS NEXT AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA On Friday the panel of three judges upheld Black\u2019s ruling in a 2-1 decision. A spokesman for Republican Attorney General Dave Yost said the state will ask the full 6th Circuit to review the case, according to Reuters. A large majority of the 6th Circuit court's members were appointed by Republican presidents, but Friday's majority consisted of Democratic appointees. \"The state\u2019s interest in preventing discrimination does not become compelling until viability,\" wrote Circuit Judge Bernice Bouie Donald, appointed by the Obama administration. Circuit Judge Alice Moore Batchelder, appointed by former President George H.W. Bush, dissented. \u201cOhio concluded that permitting physicians to become witting accomplices to the deliberate targeting of Down syndrome babies would undermine the principle that the Down syndrome population is equal in value and dignity to the rest of Ohio\u2019s population,\" Batchelder wrote, according to Cincinnati.com. BETO THREATENS TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF CHURCHES IF THEY DON'T SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE Batchelder, quoting a May opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, added that states have a \u201ccompelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.\u201d Under the law, doctors could have received up to\u00a018 months in prison for performing abortions with the knowledge that the mother had based her decision in part on a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome.

BULLOCK, LONG-SHOT 2020 DEM, INSISTS NOMINATION 'WON'T BE DECIDED BY DEBATES' The University of Utah in Salt Lake City will host the\u00a0vice presidential debate on Oct. 7, 2020. Each debate will begin at 9 p.m. ET\u00a0and run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks, the Commission announced.\u00a0Further details, including debate formats and moderators, have not yet been disclosed. Historically, the debates are aired by all of the major broadcast networks, drawing millions of viewers each night. PROTEST OUTSIDE TRUMP RALLY IN MINNEAPOLIS 'SICKENS MY STOMACH,' GOP SENATOR SAYS The Commission, which was established in 1987 and is not sponsored by the government nor by either political party, began soliciting bids from groups interested in hosting the 2020 debates about two years in advance of the election. Host criteria included having a debate hall measuring\u00a0at least 15,000 square feet with air conditioning, parking lots with space for at least\u00a040 television remote trucks, trailers and satellite trucks up to 53 feet in length, a guarantee of the complete city services, including public safety personnel, and a financial contribution. The CPD said it received bids\u00a0from six separate\u00a0groups to host a debate. Hartford, Conn. and\u00a0Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., put in bids but were not selected to host a debate. Eligible presidential candidates and their running mates will be invited to\u00a0participate in the scheduled debates after Labor Day 2020.

      "title": "California adopts nation's broadest gun seizure laws", 
      "content": " California\u00a0Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed 15 gun-related bills into law Friday, tightening\u00a0the state's already-stringent Second Amendment restrictions. One of the bills, which expands a so-called \"red flag\" law to allow co-workers, employers and educators to seek gun violence restraining orders against firearms owners they fear are a danger to themselves and others, was vetoed twice by Newsom's predecessor, Jerry Brown. Newsom also signed a companion bill allowing the gun violence restraining orders to last one and five years, although the gun owners could petition to end those restrictions earlier. The bill also allows\u00a0judges to issue search warrants at the same time as they grant the orders. The warrants can be used immediately if the gun owners are served with the relinquishment orders but fail to turn over the firearms or ammunition. \"California has outperformed the rest of the nation, because of our gun safety laws, in reducing the gun murder rate substantially compared to the national reduction,\" Newsom said as he signed the measures surrounded by state lawmakers. \"No state does it as well or comprehensively as the state of California, and we still have a long way to go.\" Between 1993 and 2017, the latest available, there was a 62 percent\u00a0decline in the gun murder rate in California, nearly double the 34 percent\u00a0nationally, Newsom\u00a0said. Co-workers who want to request a gun violence restraining order will have to\u00a0have \"substantial and regular interactions\" with gun owners, and co-workers and school employees will need to get approval from their employers or school administrators before seeking a restraining order. Those seeking the orders will be required to file sworn statements detailing their reasons for doing so. BIDEN WANTS TO GIVE ASSAULT WEAPON OWNERS TWO OPTIONS: SELL YOUR GUNS TO THE FEDS OR REGISTER The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) opposed the bill, saying\u00a0it \"poses a significant threat to civil liberties\" because a restraining order can be sought before a gun owner has an opportunity to dispute the request. Additionally, those\u00a0making a request under the new law may \"lack the relationship or skills required to make an appropriate assessment,\" the ACLU said. The bill's author, Democratic Assemblyman Phil Ting of San Francisco,\u00a0cited a recent study finding that gun restraining order laws may have helped prevent 21 mass shootings, though the University of California, Davis, researchers cautioned that \"it is impossible to know whether violence would have occurred.\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) and its state affiliate, the California Rifle and Pistol Association, opposed the new restrictions, according to the Los Angeles Times. The laws will take effect Jan. 1, 2020. GAVIN NEWSOM PREDICTS THE GOP WILL DEVELOP INTO A THIRD PARTY: 'THEY ARE FINISHED' The Democratic governor also signed a law that will limit Californians to purchasing one long rifle\u00a0per month, according to The Sacramento Bee. This law expands the current legislation that applies to handguns, and it will prevent people under 21 from purchasing semi-automatic rifles and other similar firearms. The collective measures\u00a0\"tweak\" the state's current laws and \"improve implementation,\" according to Amanda Wilcox, spokeswoman for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Ting also has a companion bill that would allow gun owners starting next September who are the subjects of restraining order requests to file a form with the court saying they won't contest the requests and are surrendering their firearms. Under current law, even those who agree to give up their guns must go through a court hearing, which Ting says wastes time and resources.

      "content": " California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday made his state the first to require public universities to offer abortion medication at campus health centers, beginning in 2023. Newsom\u00a0contrasted the progressive goals of his new law with restrictions recently enacted in other states. \u201cAs other states and the federal government go backward, restricting reproductive freedom, in California we are moving forward, expanding access and reaffirming a woman\u2019s right [to] choose,\u201d Newsom said, according to\u00a0The Sacramento Bee. \u201cWe\u2019re removing barriers to reproductive health \u2013 increasing access on college campuses and using technology to modernize how patients interact with providers.\u201d A number of states -- including Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Mississippi and Georgia\u00a0-- have in recent months enacted such abortion restrictions as banning the procedure after six weeks, when a heartbeat has been detected. A number of the restrictions have been challenged in court. Newsom\u2019s predecessor, fellow Democrat Jerry Brown, vetoed similar legislation last year, arguing such a requirement\u00a0wasn\u2019t necessary since abortion services were readily available off-campus. TERMINALLY ILL GROOM'S BUCKET LIST WEDDING TURNS OUT 'ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE' Democratic State Sen. Connie Leyva\u00a0first crafted the legislation three years ago. \u201cI am thrilled that Governor Newsom rejected the misguided paths that other states have taken in limiting access to abortion care,\u201d Leyva said in a statement. \u201cAbortion is a protected right, and it is important that everyone \u2014 including college students \u2014 have access to that right\u00a0if they so choose.\u201d The law will rely on private donations, not state dollars, to pay for the services. The state hopes to raise more than $10 million. APPEALS COURT BLOCKS OHIO BAN ON DOWN SYNDROME ABORTIONS Abortion medication is available to women who are less than 10 weeks' pregnant and requires taking two pills. The first pill blocks the hormone progesterone. The second, taken days later at home, causes an effect similar to a miscarriage. All 34 of California\u2019s public colleges would be required to provide the services. Religious and conservative groups objected to the legislation. \u201cWe oppose any effort to make it easier to abort a baby before he or she is born,\u201d Rudra Reddy, external vice president for the Berkeley College Republicans, told The Sacramento Bee. \u201cNewsom is opposed to the moratorium on the death penalty in California but he\u2019s perfectly fine executing unborn children.\u201d \"Governor Newsom\u2019s reckless support for a new abortion pill distribution scheme on California college and university campuses will put students\u2019 lives at risk and put schools at risk of lawsuits as conscience rights are violated,\" Students for Life of America president Kristan Hawkins said in a statement. \"The Pro-Life Generation will not sit back and watch their college and university campuses be turned into Planned Parenthood\u2019s new money-making machine.\" Republicans voted against the measure in committee hearings. A handful of Assembly Democrats abstained during floor debates. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Department of Finance, under Newsom\u2019s office, also opposed the bill, citing a lack of resources, personnel expertise\u00a0and private funds\u00a0to support a program of such \u201csize, scope or content.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

House Speaker Pelosi, D-Calif., blasted President Trump during a caucus call on Friday for his latest crude attack on former Vice President Joe Biden, accusing him of having become a \u201cpotty mouth\u201d -- before labeling the president \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d \u201cOne thing, I do want to say is that, POTUS \u2013 you know, that\u2019s the President \u2013 POTUS has become a potty mouth and children are listening,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThis is \u2013 this is beyond disgraceful.\u201d WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES IT WILL NOT COMPLY WITH 'ILLEGITIMATE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY She then defended Biden -- her party\u2019s potential 2020 presidential nominee -- after Trump ramped up his attacks on the former vice president during a raucous rally in Minnesota on Thursday night. During the rally, the president launched into a mock interview with Hunter, Biden's son, whom Trump called \"not too smart.\" \"Hunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly. Hunter, you're a loser,\" Trump said, his voice rising. \"Your father was never considered smart, he was never considered a good senator -- he was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's a--.\" During Friday\u2019s call, Pelosi said: \u201cFor him to say the thing that he said about Joe Biden last night was so far beyond the pale.\u201d TRUMP BELITTLES BIDENS WITH GRAPHIC LANGUAGE AT MINNEAPOLIS RALLY She then turned her attention to the ongoing impeachment inquiry -- and how the \u201cfacts\u201d of that should not stop anyone from making some of Trump\u2019s other behavior into an election issue. \u201cThat is about elections, and I will make my final point,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we are doing on impeachment is about the facts -- \u2018Just the facts, ma\u2019am\u2019 -- and the Constitution.\u00a0 His policy, his personality, his potty mouth, that\u2019s about the election, and let\u2019s make sure that we understand the reasons he is \u2013 the inquiry is because he has not honored his oath of office.\u00a0 We will honor ours.\u201d Pelosi then called Republicans in the Senate cowardly and said the impeachment inquiry is about saving the Constitution. WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY ADMITS CLIENT HAD CONTACT WITH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, AS LAWYER'S ANTI-TRUMP BIAS SURFACES \u201cThe Senate is saying, \u2018Now that you are doing that, we are not doing it.\u2019\u00a0 You know, just because we have the courage to honor our oath of office doesn\u2019t mean we have to fold to the cowardice of the Senate that is not going to honor theirs,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole point of this inquiry is to save the Constitution of the United States.\u00a0 The subpoena is the oversight that Congress has as a separation of powers \u2013 political branches of government have checks and balances on each other. \u201cI\u2019ve said before: Trump, himself, is not worthy of impeachment because it\u2019s divisive in the country.\u00a0 But our Constitution is worth it. Our democracy is worth it. And, our republic, if we can save it, is worth it.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s remarks came after the White House outlined in a defiant eight-page letter to the House Speaker and top Democrats on Tuesday why it will not participate in their \u201cillegitimate and unconstitutional\u201d impeachment inquiry, charging that the proceedings have run roughshod over congressional norms and the president's due-process rights. Trump administration officials called the letter, which was written by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and obtained by Fox News, perhaps the most historic letter the White House has sent. The document tees up a head-on collision with Democrats in Congress, who have fired off a slew of subpoenas in recent days concerning the president's alleged effort to get Ukraine to investigate political foe Joe Biden during a July phone call with Ukraine's leader. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pelosi said: \"This letter is manifestly wrong, and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump administration\u2019s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections. ... The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction.

Therefore, I am contributing the amount of their contributions to charities that serve abused women and children and the elderly in Central Texas.\" TWO GIULIANI ASSOCIATES LINKED TO UKRAINE INVESTIGATIONS INDICTED ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE CHARGES Federal prosecutors say that one of the arrested men, Lev Parnas,\u00a0urged an unidentified congressman to seek the ouster of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich\u00a0at the behest of Ukrainian government officials. That happened about the same time that Parnas and his co-defendant Igor Fruman committed to raising more than $20,000 for the politician. An indictment against Parnas and Fruman filed in the Southern District of New York\u00a0does not accuse Sessions of wrongdoing or mention him by name, simply referring to the person as \"Congressman 1.\" But donations made by Parnas and Fruman match campaign finance reports for Sessions. Sessions,\u00a0who served in the House of Representatives for 11 terms\u00a0before losing his seat\u00a0to Democrat Colin Allred in 2018, announced recently that he will be throwing his hat in the ring for Texas' 17th congressional district seat after GOP incumbent Rep.\u00a0Bill Flores\u00a0announced he'd be retiring ahead of the 2020 election cycle. Parnas and Fruman's shell company Global Energy Producers (GEP) allegedly contributed $325,000 and $15,000 to separate committees in May 2018, \u201cto obtain access to exclusive political events and gain influence with politicians,\u201d the indictment says. They allegedly incorporated GEP around the time the contributions were made. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP According to FEC records, GEP contributed $325,000 in May 2018 to pro-Trump super PAC America\u00a0First Action.\u00a0In a statement, a\u00a0spokesperson for America First Action noted that a complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in July 2018 over this contribution in addition to\u00a0separate litigation in Florida. The statement said\u00a0that the money was placed \"in a segregated bank account,\" was not used, and \"will remain in this segregated account until these matters are resolved.

      "content": " President Donald Trump held a second campaign rally in as many nights Friday, this time taking the stage in\u00a0Louisiana in the hope of rallying Republican voters against the state's Democratic Gov.\u00a0John Bel Edwards. \"Tomorrow you will head to the polls and vote to replace a liberal democrat who has sold you out, John Bell Edwards, with a great Republican governor,\" Trump said in his opening remarks. The president is expected to be joined onstage in Lake Charles by both\u00a0U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone, but not endorse either candidate in order to\u00a0maximize chances that Edwards will fall below the 50 percent\u00a0vote threshold needed to avoid a runoff in Saturday's gubernatorial \"jungle primary,\" in which all the candidates appear on a single ballot. The president's trip to\u00a0Louisiana\u00a0comes one day after another fiery rally in Minneapolis, Minn., during which Trump slammed House Democrats who have launched an impeachment inquiry against him. Trump slammed the \"rage-filled\u00a0Democrat party that has gone completely insane\" accusing them of waging a \"nonstop battle\" to \"overthrow\" his presidency. He also went after Joe and Hunter Biden over their\u00a0Ukrainian business dealings\u00a0for the second night in a row, accusing the media of covering up potential Biden corruption and claiming that claims against the pair are \"unsubstantiated.\" Other top Republicans, including Vice President Pence and Donald Trump Jr. have paid visits to the\u00a0state, which Trump won\u00a0by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016. Neither Abraham nor Rispone has been able to break away as the top competitor, even as Rispone poured $11 million of his own personal wealth into the campaign.\u00a0Party leaders' efforts to keep the men from fighting each other have failed, raising concerns the backbiting could wound both GOP contenders and help Edwards. Republicans blame attacks among their own candidates for helping to elect Edwards four years ago. Edwards isn't the type of liberal, anti-Trump Democrat with whom the president usually clashes. Louisiana's governor is an anti-abortion, pro-gun West Point graduate who avoids criticizing Trump, talks about his strong rapport with the White House and calls the impeachment inquiry a distraction for Washington. While Edwards' efforts to keep the president at bay in the governor's race have been unsuccessful, the Democratic incumbent isn't complaining about the rallies. Instead, he has downplayed them, calling it unsurprising that Trump backs members of his own party in the \"hyperpartisan\" environment of Washington. He said he would continue to \"work well\" with the president and focus on his own, bipartisan approach to governing. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \"When my opponents realized just how much support my campaign had from the people of Louisiana, they started calling in help from forces in Washington, D.C.,\" Edwards said. \"My opponents are obsessed with political partisanship because the only way they think they can win is to divide the state of Louisiana.\" Republicans nationally have targeted Edwards for ouster since his longshot election victory four years ago. But work to unify around one major contender failed, with the state's top-tier, well-known GOP officials passing on the race. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

McAleenan issued a statement Friday night following the president's announcement, thanking him for \"the opportunity to serve alongside the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security.\" \"With his [Trump's] support, over the last six months we have made tremendous progress mitigating the border security and humanitarian crisis we faced this year, by reducing unlawful crossings, partnering with governments in the region to counter human smugglers and [addressing] the causes of migration, and [deploying] additional border security resources,\" he said. McAleenan took over in April after Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen quit, and he was the fourth person to lead the department in two years. Trump hasn't named anyone to the job yet -- the acting deputy is David Pekoske, the head of the Transportation Security Administration. McAleenan, a longtime U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, was seen as a level head who could effectively manage the border crisis, but like many other former administration officials who came before, Trump eventually soured on him. The 240,000-person department is tasked with election security and cybersecurity, disaster response and even the Secret Service. But for Trump, the Department of Homeland Security means one thing: immigration. The president's signature issue makes the department his focus and his ire. Balancing a White House eager to push major changes with the reality on the ground is a constant challenge. On Monday, McAleenan was shouted off stage during a speaking engagement at Georgetown Law School by audience members protesting the\u00a0Trump administration\u2019s\u00a0policies on immigration. He told \"Fox & Friends\" that \"part of the irony here is that this is supposed to be a group of immigration law experts who wanted to hear the facts of what's happening on the border. The facts of what's broken about our immigration system.\" \"I was going to challenge them on how we could talk and start a dialogue about how to fix it,\" McAleenan said. \"But, apparently [I] didn't get that opportunity.\" When it was clear that\u00a0Georgetown Law Center\u00a0was \"not going to change that direction of that dialogue,\" McAleenan realized it was \"time to go.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Law Center released a statement sharing McAleenan's regret and said: \"Georgetown is deeply committed to freedom of speech and expression.\" McAleenan had said the border crisis\u00a0was at its \"breaking point\" during a visit to\u00a0Texas in March, reiterating there were not enough agents to respond. Before serving in government, McAleenan practiced law in California. He attended Amherst College in Massachusetts and holds his law degree from the University of Chicago.
