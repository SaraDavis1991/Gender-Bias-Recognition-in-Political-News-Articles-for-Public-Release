      "title": "Schweizer & McLeod: Hunter Biden Helped China Acquire \u2018Strategically Sensitive Assets\u2019", 
      "content": " Schweizer and McLeod provide further details on the investments former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, facilitated via his Chinese-backed investment firm. In 2013, less than two weeks after accompanying his father on an official visit to Beijing\u2013and despite his lack of pertinent expertise\u2013Hunter Biden secured $1 billion (later raised to $1.5 billion) from the state-owned Bank of China for his newly formed investment firm, Bohai Harvest RST (BHR). This was in addition to the first-of-its-kind deal the Chinese government awarded Biden\u2019s private equity firm Rosemont Seneca in the recently formed Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, a deal that allowed the firm to focus on international acquisitions. \u201cWith the backing of the state-owned Bank of China, one of the country\u2019s \u2018big four\u2019 financial institutions, BHR had access to the types of deals that most Western firms only dreamed of, including IPOs of state-owned companies,\u201d Schweizer and McLeod write, noting that Biden\u2019s firm \u201cinvested in strategically sensitive assets in both China and the United States.\u201d They write: In December 2014, BHR became an \u201canchor investor\u201d in the IPO of China General Nuclear Power Company (CGN), a state-owned nuclear company involved in the development of nuclear reactors. Not only is CGN a strategically important company in China, it was also facing legal scrutiny in the United States. In 2016, CGN was charged with espionage by the Justice Department for stealing US nuclear secrets. As a \u201ccross-border\u201d investment fund, Bohai Harvest was interested in making deals outside of China. In 2015, BHR acquired Henniges Automotive, a Michigan-based producer of vibration-dampening equipment, alongside Chinese military contractor Aviation Industry Corp. of China (AVIC). Given the military applications of Henniges\u2019 technology, the deal required federal approval. Like CGN, AVIC was suspected of stealing US technology for its purposes. Not long after the Henniges deal closed, AVIC debuted its new J-20 fighter \u2014 incorporating designs allegedly stolen from the US\u2019 F-35 program. Schweizer and McLeod conclude by asking, \u201cDid the Chinese give favorable treatment to Hunter Biden to curry favor with his vice-president father? The American public deserves to understand what exactly Hunter Biden was doing overseas and the extent of then-Vice President Biden\u2019s involvement.\u201d The timing of Hunter Biden\u2019s business deal is particularly problematic. His father was negotiating U.S. policy with China at a time when the regime\u2019s behavior had become increasingly menacing to U.S. allies in the region. Vice President Biden\u2019s kid-gloves treatment of China during that trip\u2014a fact which was widely criticized by U.S. allies at the time\u2014also raises questions in light of the lucrative business deals his son secured just two weeks later. Biden\u2019s BHR focused on strategic energy and defense projects, including U.S. companies specializing in technology used by our military, as Breitbart\u2019s Haris Alic reported: In 2015, BHR and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) \u2014 an aerospace and defense conglomerate owned and operated by the Chinese government \u2014 made\u00a0a $600 million bid to purchase Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company. The sale required approval from the Obama-Biden administration\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), as AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges produced \u201cdual-use\u201d anti-vibration technology with U.S. \u201cmilitary applications.\u201d CFIUS, which is\u00a0made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies including the Departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, is\u00a0required\u00a0to review any transaction with national security implications. When the AVIC and BHR\u2019s bid was first announced, alarm bells went off in certain sectors of the defense industry.\u00a0In particular, many noted that AVIC\u00a0was \u201creportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,\u201d which it later \u201creportedly incorporated \u2026 into China\u2019s J-20 and J\u201131 aircraft.\u201d Despite the national security concerns, CFIUS approved the deal with AVIC, purchasing 51 percent of the company while BHR took ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter\u00a0stated\u00a0the deal was the \u201cbiggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.\u201d The acquisition of foreign technology is a key component of China\u2019s aggressive \u201cMade In China 2025\u201d (MI2025) strategy to overtake the United States economically and militarily by dominating key technologies of the future (i.e. artificial intelligence, robotics, electric vehicles, 5G telecommunications, etc.). A 2017 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce explained the role private equity firms like Hunter Biden\u2019s play in this strategy. The Chinese government \u201cis injecting state funds into private equity to fund foreign acquisitions\u201d of companies with technology identified as a priority for MI2025, according to the report. In his extensive report last February on China\u2019s \u201cwhole-of-state\u201d strategy for global dominance, Florida Senator Marco Rubio also noted\u00a0the communist regime\u2019s reliance on \u201cintellectual property acquisitions\u201d to achieve its ambitions. \u201cChina is becoming a significant shareholder in U.S. industries, and is selectively targeting those with strategic implications,\u201d Matt Stoller and Lucas Kunce wrote in The American Conservative last June. Their analysis exposes the extend to which China has co-opted Wall Street against the longterm interests of the American economy and national security. For example, they write: Jennifer M. Harris, an expert in global markets with experience at the U.S. State Department and the U.S. National Intelligence Council, researched a\u00a0recent explosion\u00a0of Chinese strategic investment in American technology companies. She found that China has systematically targeted U.S. greenfield investments, \u201ctechnology goods (especially semiconductors), R&D networks, and advanced manufacturing.\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s attorneys told ABC News last June that Biden still sits on BHR\u2019s board and owns a minority stake in the fund. At his campaign rally in Minneapolis yesterday, President Trump called out Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings with China while his father was negotiating U.S. policy with the communist regime. \u201cBiden allowed China to rip off America for eight years as vice president,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cAnd Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and we are not doing that anymore. Those days are over. The Bidens got rich, and that is substantiated, while America got robbed. That\u2019s what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends sold out America.\u201d The House Democrat impeachment inquiry has brought renewed interest in the sweetheart deals Hunter Biden\u2019s private equity firm secured while his father was vice president, as detailed in Schweizer\u2019s 2018 bestseller\u00a0Secret Empires. Democrats allege that President Trump attempted to coerce the Ukrainians into investigating corruption charges against former Vice President Biden during a July phone with his Ukrainian counterpart. The allegation centers around\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s lucrative dealings with a Ukrainian oligarch-owned energy company at a time when his father was mediating U.S. policy towards Ukraine. The natural gas firm Burisma Holdings paid Hunter Biden over $50,000 per month for his work as a board member, despite his total lack of experience in Ukraine or the energy sector. Just a few months prior to landing this Ukrainian deal, Hunter Biden had been dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Navy Reserve for testing positive to cocaine use. A Ukrainian corruption probe into Burisma Holdings was scuttled in 2016, when Vice President Biden\u00a0threatened\u00a0to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to the country if the Ukrainian government did not fire the prosecutor who launched the corruption investigation. Withholding the loans would have thrown the former Soviet republic into insolvency at a time when it was fending off attacks from Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. Both Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denied the Democrats claim that Trump delayed military funding to Ukrainian in order to pressure Zelensky\u2019s government to investigate the Bidens. The Trump White House has refused to cooperate with the Democrat impeachment inquiry, declaring it a \u201cpartisan and unconstitutional\u201d investigation.

      "content": " The two-time Oscar-winning star said she wants to see fossil fuels phased out over 30 years and wants the government to stop leasing permits for fossil fuel development on public lands and waters. The 81-year-old Jane Fonda was arrested Friday after she and a group of fellow sign-wielding agitators refused to move from\u00a0the steps of the U.S. Capitol building where she was participating in her \u201cFire Drill Fridays\u201d protest for the environment. In a recent interview, Fonda said that she convinced Netflix to give her four months off before shooting the final season of Grace and Frankie. \u201cWell, I went to Ted Sarandos who\u2019s the [chief content officer] of Netflix, and I asked him if he could give me a year off,\u201d she told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cAnd he tried and couldn\u2019t because of the contracts. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of actors in the mix. And so four months is what I could get. And then when we finish, it\u2019ll be a longer season because it\u2019s out last season. Then I\u2019ll come right back.\u201d Fonda said she is moving to Washington \u201cto be at the epicenter of the fight for our climate,\u201d in a statement on her official website. \u201cEvery Friday through January, I will be leading weekly demonstrations on Capitol Hill to demand that action by our political leaders be taken to address the climate emergency we are in. We can\u2019t afford to wait.\u201d  The Netflix star said she was inspired by young people, including 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. \u201cI mean, I knew about Greta, I didn\u2019t know she was on the spectrum. And I really didn\u2019t know what Asperger\u2019s meant,\u201d Fonda told the Times.\u00a0\u201cOn the spectrum, if they are interested in something, they have a laser focus on that and whatever the denials and rationalizations the rest of us indulge in, that doesn\u2019t come into play with her.\u201d Fonda also talked about her feelings about President Donald Trump.\u00a0\u201cI did not expect it would be this bad. I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. The Klute actress also said she called Jared Kushner, who is the president\u2019s son-in-law and advisor, about environmental issues. Fonda said that Kushner told her to speak to his wife, Ivanka Trump. \u201cAnd so I called her And she said, \u2018I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u2019 Nothing,\u201d recalled Fonda. On her website, the actress says, \u201cI will be on the Capitol every Friday, rain or shine, inspired and emboldened by the incredible movement our youth have created. I can no longer stand by and let our elected officials ignore \u2013 and even worse \u2013 empower \u2013 the industries that are destroying our planet for profit.

      "title": "Mexican President AMLO to Nancy Pelosi: Pass USMCA Already!", 
      "content": " President Donald Trump announced the USMCA one year ago, after extensive negotiations with both Canada and Mexico. The trade deal will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which Trump has long criticized and which he promised to replace. The new deal includes terms more favorable to U.S. businesses and workers, and is one of the most significant economic and foreign policy achievements of the Trump presidency. While Democrats have spoken favorably about the USMCA, they have also suggested changes to the agreement. They are also reluctant to acknowledge Trump\u2019s success and to approve anything for which he will later take credit. Obrador, known also by the acronym AMLO, told reporters Friday that he had sent a letter to Pelosi urging her to pass the USMCA. \u201cThere\u2019s agreement, and I took the opportunity to send Mrs Pelosi a letter explaining that it\u2019s in the interest of the three peoples, the three nations, that this deal is approved,\u201d he said, according to\u00a0The Hill. Republicans also pressed the House Speaker to stop stalling. When Pelosi posted a subtweet \u2014 a tweet that attacks someone without using their Twitter handle \u2014 targeting Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), Ernst fired back about the USMCA:  A poll in February showed that Americans wanted Congress to pass the USMCA \u201cby a nearly four-to-one margin.\u201d Joel B.

      "subtitle": "Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch on Friday told House Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to remove her from her post because he had \u201clost confidence\u201d in her.",

      "title": "Former Ambassador to Ukraine Tells Congress: Trump Pressured State to Remove Me", 
      "content": " In written testimony prepared for her deposition in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, Yovanovitch declared that she was \u201cabruptly\u201d told to return to Washington in late April. Yovanovitch served as the American ambassador to Ukraine from August 2016 through May 20, 2019. She now serves as a State Department fellow at Georgetown University. In her written remarks, obtained by the Washington Post and other news outlets, the former ambassador noted that she met with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan to discuss \u201cwhy my posting ended so suddenly,\u201d adding: He said that the President had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador. He added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the [State] Department had been under pressure from the President to remove me since the Summer of 2018. He also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause. I departed Ukraine for good this past May. Yovanovitch testified before House Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry despite the White House indicating earlier this week it would block all officials from testifying. In a letter to House Democrat leaders, the White House dismissed the probe as unfair and \u201cillegitimate.\u201d The Trump administration attempted to block her deposition, prompting House Democrats to issue a subpoena for her appearance that ultimately compelled her to testify, the chairmen of the House panels leading the impeachment probe said in a joint statement. On Tuesday, the State Department ordered U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland not to testify, prompting House Democrats to subpoena him. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the following day vowed that his department would fulfill its legal obligations in responding to the impeachment inquiry. Pompeo noted, however, that the State Department would take its cues from the White House Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported in early October that Trump ousted Yovanovitch \u201cafter months of complaints from allies outside the administration, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, that she was undermining him abroad and obstructing efforts to persuade Kyiv to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201d The former ambassador denied those allegations in her written remarks, saying: [F]ictitious is the notion that I am disloyal to President Trump. I have heard the allegation in the media that I supposedly told the Embassy team to ignore the President\u2019s orders \u201csince he was going to be impeached.\u201d That allegation is false. I have never said such a thing, to my Embassy colleagues or to anyone else. Next, the Obama administration did not ask me to help the Clinton campaign or harm the Trump campaign, nor would I have taken any such steps if they had.\n\n\u2026\n\nAlthough I understand that I served at the pleasure of the President, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an Ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives. The former ambassador said she had \u201cminimal contacts\u201d with Giuliani. The \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d complaint fueling the impeachment inquiry mentions Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster as an example of what the leaker described as the U.S. president\u2019s abuse of power. According to the \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d Trump attempted to coerce Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating allegations of corruption against Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange for aid during a July 25 call. Trump and Zelensky have denied the allegations. A partial transcript of the calls released by the White House cites Trump as telling Zelensky the former U.S. ambassador is \u201cbad news.\u201d",

When the Court ruled in the 2008 Heller case that the Second Amendment protected a fundamental right, it was clear that this right belongs to everyone, not just the residents of an individual state. The Seventh Circuit held in Moore v. Madigan that the carrying of firearms in public for self-defense is a fundamental right, but under existing Illinois restrictions, that right has been limited to Illinois residents and citizens from only four other states. On December 11, 2012, Breitbart News reported the Seventh Circuit ruling that brought concealed carry to Illinois. Judge Richard Posner wrote the court\u2019s Majority Opinion, saying: We are disinclined to engage in another round of historical analysis to determine whether eighteenth-century America understood the Second Amendment to include a right to bear guns outside the home.

      "title": "Greta Thunberg\u2019s Cause Could Have Cost Her Peace Prize: No Science to Connect Climate\u00a0Change to Conflict", 
      "content": " Thunberg was a bookmaker favorite to win the prize, and her almost 3 million Twitter followers also were hopeful she would win for her attempt to convince world leaders that the United Nations is correct in its estimation that man-made climate change could lead to mass extinction. But the prize committee disagreed. It chose Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who put in place a peace process to finally end a 20-year conflict with neighboring Eritrea. But the Washington Post reported Thunberg\u2019s cause may not be the right vehicle for a peace prize, and then tried to make the case that it should be. According to the report: Henrik Urdal, the head of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo, omitted Thunberg from the\u00a0Nobel Peace Prize shortlist he publishes.\u00a0He explained his decision to the Washington Post, saying there \u201cisn\u2019t scientific consensus that there is a linear relationship between climate change \u2014 or resource scarcity, more broadly \u2014 and armed conflict.\u201d The link between climate change and conflict is hotly debated. But climate change scholars say that while there isn\u2019t a straightforward relationship,\u00a0there is a recognition that climate change adds to stresses in regions that could spark political instability and conditions that could foster conflict. The Pentagon has called climate change a\u00a0\u201cthreat multiplier.\u201d The prize has gone to environmental champions before. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and former vice president Al Gore won \u201cfor their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.\u201d In 2004, it was given to Wangari Maathai \u201cfor her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace.\u201d In 1970, it went to Norman Borlaug, sometimes called the \u201cfather of the green revolution.\u201d Urdal told the Post that those awards could be a thing of the past because of what Alfred Nobel hoped the prize would represent. \u201cIn his will outlining the prize, Nobel wrote that the recipient should be someone who has advanced the \u2018abolition or reduction of standing armies\u2019 \u2014 which some have interpreted as requiring a direct connection to peace and conflict,\u201d the Post reported. \u201cIf you make it too broad, it becomes a bit meaningless,\u201d Urdal said. The Post then checked in with a politics professor at the University of Oslo, who called Thunberg a \u201cwild card\u201d nominee. \u201cThe link between climate change and conflict is still \u2018quite tenuous at this point,\u2019 she said in the Post report. \u201cEveryone sees flooding can cause conflict, migration and so on, but this is no way well established as a security policy issue yet.\u201d The Post also speculated that it could have been poor timing for Thunberg since the committee puts together its shortlist of nominees at the end of January \u2014 before the teen made a splash with her transatlantic sail from Europe to New York on a solar-powered racing yacht and her fiery speech at the United Nations calling out adults for failing to address climate change. On Friday when the announcement was made Thunberg was in Denver with other teens who skipped school to protest climate change. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

On the Angel Family\u2019s Facebook page, Justice for Jared Vargas, they celebrated the life sentence of the illegal alien who took their loved one\u2019s life. \u201cLife!!!\u201d the Angel Family posted. A photo memorial of 20-year-old college student Jared Vargas, a loving brother to his twin and little sister, who was murdered by an illegal alien in June 2018. (Photo via Facebook) Vargas, a cybersecurity student at the University of Texas at San Antonio, was found murdered by Esquivel-Garcia on June 18, 2018, when firefighters arrived at the scene of an apartment set ablaze. Prosecutors said the illegal alien had brutally strangled and stabbed Vargas to death before setting his body on fire in the apartment complex.\u00a0Throughout the trial, Esquivel-Garcia and his attorneys had used a defense and smear against Vargas to justify the murder, claiming that the illegal alien killed Vargas in self-defense because he believed that he was under threat of being sexually assaulted. The murder occurred after Esquivel-Garcia had been twice released from police and federal custody back into the U.S. and was only given a voluntary deportation order despite having a criminal record. In March 2017, the illegal alien was arrested for drunk driving and was eventually turned over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. Though he was placed into deportation proceedings, an immigration judge allowed him to post bond, and he was released back into the interior of the country. In May 2018, a month before Vargas was murdered, Esquivel-Garcia was again put into ICE custody and local police custody but was able to post bond and be released back into the U.S. with only the promise that he would self-deport. Esquivel-Garcia is eligible for parole in 30 years, and if ever released on parole, he will be deported by federal immigration officials to Mexico. Jared Vargas leaves behind his twin brother, in college, and a little sister, in high school, as well as his parents and countless loved ones and friends. A\u00a0GoFundMe page\u00a0has been set up in his honor to help his twin brother and little sister in their schooling. John Binder is a reporter\u00a0for Breitbart News.

Liu He. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to a very substantial phase one deal,\u201d Trump said, noting that it would soon be written and signed by both parties. The president said that China had agreed to $40 billion to $50 billion in agricultural purchases, as well as an agreement on intellectual property and financial services. \u201cThat\u2019s the largest order in the history of agriculture,\u201d Trump said.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that they had also reached an agreement surrounding China\u2019s currency after the United States labeled the country as a currency manipulator. Trump said that the deal was still \u201csubject to getting written,\u201d but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that the\u00a0scheduled tariff hike from 25 percent to 30 percent on October 15 would not take place as a result of the agreement. Trump said he would likely sign the potential deal with President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in Chile in November. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be a problem getting it papered,\u201d Trump said, referring to the agreement. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the Chinese technology Huawei was not part of the deal and would be dealt with separately. The stock market jumped over 500 points on Friday in reaction to the news but closed at 315 points. Lighthizer confirmed the scheduled December 15 tariffs would remain in place for now. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time to make that decision,\u201d Lighthizer said. Trump said that it was possible that phase two and phase three part of the deal would happen afterward. \u201cCongratulations on the 70th\u201d Trump said, referring to the Chinese Communist party in China celebrating their 70th anniversary. He described the military parade and event \u201camazing to watch.\u201d The Vice Premier thanked Trump for his congratulatory remarks about the Chinese government\u2019s anniversary and expressed optimism about the future talks between the two countries. \u201cWe have made substantial progress in many fields, and we are very happy about it,\u201d Liu said. Liu also presented Trump with a letter from Xi Jinping to the president who took it out of the envelope and showed it to reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re working on enforcement right now,\u201d Trump said, noting that the deals would be written and set for the signed agreement in November. \u201cWe think that China wants it badly and we want it also,\u201d he said.

We know that LGBTQ youth are much more likely to experience homelessness, which is one of the reasons why we need to invest more in youth homelessness in general and do the opposite of what this president is doing, which is allowing rules to go forward that would actually make it harder for transgender youth to access homeless services. \u201cThat is just wrong, and it will end in my administration,\u201d Buttigieg said. In fact, while the HUD rule \u2014 posted in spring 2019 \u2014 does allow for shelters to make decisions based on privacy and safety, it specifically states that discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation and gender identity\u201d will not take place: This proposed rule provides that grant recipients, subrecipients, owners, operators, managers, and providers (Shelter Providers) under HUD programs which permit single-sex or sex-segregated facilities (such as bathrooms or temporary, emergency shelters and other buildings and facilities with physical limitations or configurations that require and are permitted to have shared sleeping quarters or bathing facilities) may establish a policy, consistent with state and local law, by which such Shelter Provider considers an individual\u2019s sex for the purposes of determining accommodation within such shelters and for purposes of determining sex for admission to any facility or portion thereof. The proposed rule permits Shelter Providers to consider a range of factors in making such determinations, including privacy, safety, practical concerns, religious beliefs, any relevant considerations under civil rights and nondiscrimination authorities , the individual\u2019s sex as reflected in official government documents, as well as the gender which a person identifies with. The proposed rule does not dictate a required basis for making determinations other than that they be consistent with an overall policy. The proposed rule continues HUD\u2019s policy of ensuring that its programs are open to all eligible individuals and families regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Buttigieg joined eight other Democrat candidates at the marathon town hall, including Sens.

      "content": " \u201cWhen Turkey notified us of an imminent military operation, we relocated a small contingent of less than 50 special operations soldiers out of the immediate zone of attack,\u201d he said. \u201cThis decision was made to ensure that American troops were not caught up in the fighting between Turkish and Kurdish forces.\u201d \u201cThe safety of our men and women in uniform remains our top priority,\u201d he added. Esper said Turkey\u2019s decision put the U.S. in a tough situation, given that Turkey is a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally. He said: The impulsive action of President Erdogan to invade northern Syria has put the United States in a tough situation, given our relationship with our NATO ally Turkey, who has fought alongside the United States in the past, and the Syrian Democratic Forces who helped us destroy the physical caliphate of ISIS, and the safety of U.S. military personnel. He said, \u201cRather than get pulled into this conflict, we put the safety of our soldiers first, while urging Turkey to forego its operations and working hard with us to address their concerns through the development of a security zone along the border.\u201d Despite the administration\u2019s decision to take U.S. troops out of a pending military clash, critics have attacked the administration for \u201cabandoning\u201d the Syrian Kurds, who the U.S. armed to defeat the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria. Critics have accused the Trump administration of \u201cgreen-lighting\u201d a Turkish incursion into northern Syria, where the Kurds had staked out a semi-autonomous region during the Syrian civil war. The Turks, who consider the Syrian Kurds to be terrorists and an existential threat, have long wanted to move against them in Syria. Esper said the U.S. had tried to prevent any pending attack, but that ultimately Turkey decided to make a move. He and other senior national security officials have adamantly denied that the administration gave Turkey the green light. \u201cWe oppose and are greatly disappointed by Turkey\u2019s decision to launch a unilateral, military incursion into northern Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cThis operation puts our SDF partners in harm\u2019s way, it risks the security of ISIS prison camps, and will further destabilize the region.\u201d \u201cFrom the president on down, we have communicated with the Turks on this issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke with Turkish Defense Minister Akar yesterday to express our strong opposition to Turkey\u2019s actions, and reiterated the damage this is doing to our bilateral relationship.\u201d He also said the U.S. was not abandoning the Syrian Kurds. \u201cTo be clear, we are not abandoning our Kurdish partner forces and U.S. troops remain with them in other parts of Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cWe remain in close coordination with the Syrian Democratic Forces who helped us destroy the physical caliphate of ISIS, but I will not place American service members in the middle of a longstanding conflict between the Turks and the Kurds. This is not why we are in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to work with members of the defeat ISIS coalition and the Syrian Democratic Forces to ensure the defeat of ISIS,\u201d he said. In addition, he said the Syrian Defense Forces have transferred two ISIS terrorists to U.S. custody who were involved in the kidnapping and murder of U.S. and U.K. citizens in Syria. He said they were being held in a safe and secure location in the U.S., but outside of Syria. Follow Breitbart News\u2019s @Kristina_Wong.",

      "title": "Report: Democrats Privately Urging Pelosi to Hold Impeachment Inquiry Vote", 
      "content": " So far, Pelosi has refused to schedule a vote, arguing that the Constitution and House rules do not require the lawmakers to do so. Meanwhile, the White House and its Republican congressional allies contend that such a vote is necessary to legitimize the inquiry per the recognized standards of previous impeachment efforts. Politico reported: Some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, publicly \u2014 that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point. \u2026 Though a small but growing chorus of Democrats has started urging a vote simply to undercut this GOP talking point, others say that nothing will stop Trump and his supporters from claiming Democrats\u2019 efforts are unfair and inconsistent with past impeachment procedures. They say the party shouldn\u2019t take the White House\u2019s bait, arguing that the president\u2019s defenders will simply find other reasons to not comply with the inquiry. The \u201cprivate\u201d debate on whether or not to hold a vote \u201cis threatening to cleave Democrats\u2019 unified front\u201d in favor of impeachment, the news outlet added. Rep. John Yarmuth (D-KY) publicly called for a vote, telling Politico,\u201cIf Nancy asked me, I would say sure, let\u2019s have a vote. Everybody\u2019s on record, so they\u2019re not going to vote any differently. What\u2019s the danger in having a vote to formalize it?\u201d House lawmakers voted to allow an investigation into whether to impeach President Bill Clinton and President Richard Nixon. Republicans have pointed to those votes as evidence that Democrats are acting in an unfair and illegitimate manner. Politico noted: Democrats have long argued that they don\u2019t need a vote to launch formal impeachment proceedings, even if that had been the practice in prior presidential impeachment processes. In fact, House lawyers backed by Pelosi have made that argument in a succession of court cases seeking evidence to support their impeachment inquiry, and proponents of that position worry a formal vote would undercut their legal claims. Similarly, Democrats are worried that a near-term floor vote would drive away a handful of Republicans who are wavering over whether to support impeachment proceedings. A party-line vote would hand the White House another talking point, they argue: that impeachment is a purely partisan effort by Democrats. In a letter to Pelosi and the House chairmen pursuing the impeachment inquiry, the White House said the Democrats were conducting a \u201cconstitutionally invalid\u201d and \u201cillegitimate\u201d impeachment probe that absolves lawmakers of \u201ctaking political accountability.\u201d The White House said it would not cooperate with the ongoing \u201cpartisan\u201d impeachment investigation. Although the letter stopped short of explicitly calling on Pelosi to hold a vote, it all but dared the Speaker to do so. Most of the 235 members of the House Democratic Caucus support the impeachment probe, but there are still eight who did not, as of Thursday afternoon, a tally from the New York Times revealed.",

      "title": "All Eyes on Louisiana: Gubernatorial \u2018Jungle Primary\u2019 First Election in Nation Since Impeachment Inquiry", 
      "content": " The primary pits incumbent Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards against Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-LA) and Republican businessman Eddie Rispone. Edwards has been hovering in recent polls just a few points under the 50 percent majority he will need to avoid a November runoff election against Saturday\u2019s second place finisher. Abraham and Rispone have been jockeying for the second spot, with both registering between 20 percent and 25 percent in recent polls. President Trump has been attacking Edwards vigorously in recent days, portraying him as another Democrat in lockstep with the impeachment inquiry announced two weeks ago by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). On Tuesday, White House Counsel Pat Cippolone sent a powerful letter to Pelosi, calling the inquiry an illegal and unconstitutional violation of the president\u2019s due process rights. For his part, Edwards has attempted to deflect the president\u2019s attacks while avoiding a direct confrontation, as The Advocate reported on Friday: Hours before President Donald Trump\u2019s planned rally in Lake Charles Friday, Gov. John Bel Edwards said voters should not take cues from the \u201cpartisanship\u201d of Washington, D.C., and touted his working relationship with the president on the eve of the open primary election in the governor\u2019s race. Edwards, the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, responded to Trump\u2019s Twitter missives against him, noting he has long held a pro-gun stance and saying Trump doesn\u2019t know him or Louisiana. \u201cI don\u2019t think Louisiana should be taking its inspiration from the partisanship of D.C.,\u201d he said in a half-hour-long press conference at SOWELA Community Technical College in Lake Charles. \u201cI think Washington, instead, should take inspiration from the bipartisanship of Louisiana.\u201d The Washington Post noted that Edwards\u2019 efforts to avoid a runoff may fall short: As the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, John Bel Edwards appeared to be doing everything necessary to win a second term in Louisiana, a state whose populist Democratic roots seem to fray a bit more each year. Edwards signed some of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws . He cozied up to President Trump, scoring an invite to a state dinner at the White House. And in a state with a robust Catholic population, Edwards aired television ads showing him shaking hands with Pope Francis. But all that still might not be enough for the governor to win his reelection battle outright on Saturday, as Trump holds an 11th-hour rally to boost support for the two leading GOP challengers. Early voting results suggest that the impeachment inquiry has created massive increases in Republican and Independent turnout, as Breitbart News reported\u00a0on Sunday: Early voting in the October 12 \u201cjungle primary\u201d between incumbent Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and two Republican candidates ended on Saturday, and the turnout is massive, particularly among Republicans and Independents. \u201cAs of last night, 374,190 Louisianians either early voted by person or by mail in ballot (340,480 in person, and 33,710 mail in ballots). To put this number in perspective, this is the highest early voting turnout EVER for a non-Presidential election, and is the second highest early voting turnout EVER (only the 2016 Presidential election has seen a higher in person + absentee voting turnout with 531,555 early votes),\u201d Louisiana-based JMC Analytics reported on Sunday. \u201cRepublican turnout volume is up 84%, while Independent turnout is up 80% and Democratic turnout is up 36%,\u201d JMC Analytics concluded. On election eve, the question of whether Edwards will surpass the 50 percent margin needed to avoid a runoff remains in doubt. The outcome is likely to be determined by Republican turnout on election day. Historically, about 80 percent of all votes in the gubernatorial jungle primary are cast on election day. Should Edwards fail to reach 50 percent, Republicans are expected to rally around the second place finisher in the November runoff, whether it be Abraham or Rispone. That possible Republican consolidation in a potential November runoff election may be easier for Abraham than Rispone, since Abraham has focused his campaign attacks on Rispone, while Rispone has criticized both Edwards and Abraham.",

Smith, known for his critical coverage of President Donald\u00a0Trump, said in a statement: Recently I asked the company to allow me to leave FOX News and begin a new chapter. After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged. The opportunities afforded this guy from small town Mississippi have been many. It\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor. I\u2019ve worked with the most talented, dedicated and focused professionals I know and I\u2019m proud to have anchored their work each day \u2014 I will deeply miss them. According to CNN, staffers inside Fox News were \u201copenly weeping\u201d over the news of Smith\u2019s departure and said some \u201cwere here and have stayed here solely\u201d due to the anchor. Smith joined\u00a0Fox News in 1996 and covered copious\u00a0breaking news stories for the network for over two decades. In a statement,\u00a0Fox News president and executive editor, Jay Wallace, said Smith will leave his post as chief news anchor and managing editor of the outlet\u2019s breaking news unit. Wallace said in a statement: Shep is one of the premier newscasters of his generation and his extraordinary body of work is among the finest journalism in the industry. His integrity and outstanding reporting from the field helped put FOX News on the map and there is simply no better breaking news anchor who has the ability to transport a viewer to a place of conflict, tragedy, despair or elation through his masterful delivery. We are proud of the signature reporting and anchoring style he honed at FOX News, along with everything he accomplished here during his monumental 23-year tenure. While this day is especially difficult as his former producer, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network. Smith\u2019s departure comes as President Trump\u2019s relationship with Fox News continues to deteriorate. On Thursday, the president knocked Smith in a pair of tweets that were critical of a Fox News poll that found a record 51 percent of voters support his impeachment and removal from office. The president\u00a0tweeted: Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Speaking to reporters ahead of his rally in Louisiana, President Trump questioned whether Smith\u2019s exit from Fox News was prompted by his ratings. \u201cI\u2019m assuming he\u2019s leaving because of bad ratings,\u201d the president said. \u201cI wish him well,\u201d he added.",
