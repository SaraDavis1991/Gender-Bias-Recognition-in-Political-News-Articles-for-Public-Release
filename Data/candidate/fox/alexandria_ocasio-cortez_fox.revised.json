Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,\u00a0will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally designed to generate excitement for the senator\u2019s campaign following his recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate,\u00a0Fox News confirmed. SANDERS PROMISES NEW JOBS FOR 'TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS' DURING DEMOCRATIC DEBATE In addition, CNN reported that Rep.\u00a0Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event. \"Bernie is leading a working class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity and geography,\" Omar was quoted as saying in a statement posted on Twitter by the Sanders campaign \u2014\u00a0and that Omar retweeted on her own Twitter page. \"I believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020,\" Omar added. The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who, like Sanders, has been representing the party\u2019s progressive wing. Word of the endorsements also followed Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate in Ohio, where Warren was under attack from multiple candidates after rising in the polls in recent weeks.

There was no indication that the fourth member of the Squad, Rep.

SEAN HANNITY, HOST: I get an e-mail today that says help save Tucker. And I'm like, what's wrong with Tucker? Tucker is fine. He's there. OK, we are glad you're OK. Anyway, welcome to \u201cHannity.\u201d Thank you, Tucker. Tonight, the disgraceful radical extreme Democratic socialist party, they had what will likely be the first of many failed votes to attempt to impeach a duly elected president. Will somebody please give these people a copy of the Constitution? We'll have more coming up. Also, we begin tonight to the members of the, quote, squad ramping up their attacks on anyone and everyone who dares to disagree with their extreme, radical, socialist ideas. Now, the 2020 hopefuls -- they have been put on notice. Everyone in the Democratic Party, you better fall in line or, A, you might be called a racist, or B, they are keeping the squad, the equivalent of an enemies list of fellow Democrats that oppose them, I guess, so that they can campaign against them. It's getting that ugly. Now, the squad has already lobbed racism charges against both President Trump and even their own speaker, Nancy Pelosi. And while Nancy Pelosi is totally powerless, as we've been telling you, to defend herself, the president is firing back in a big way. Just moments ago, the president wrapped up what was a massive rally in Greenville, in North Carolina, where he had a very special message for the new radical leaders of this Democratic extreme socialist party. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: So, Representative Omar blamed the United States for the terrorist attack on our country, saying that terrorism is a reaction to our involvement in other people's affairs. Her colleague Representative Rashida Tlaib agreed with Omar's characterization of 9/11 and said members of Congress who support Israel forgot what country they represent. Cortez said that illegal immigrants are more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be. Can you believe that? That's what she's saying? She describes contemporary America -- that's you. That's me. That's all of us -- as garbage. Garbage. And they are so angry. Even yesterday, they went on the stand, I say, let me watch this, and the anger -- they were trying to be nice, but it's hard. It's hard for them to do that. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: You know, smelly Walmart voters, irredeemable, deplorables, people that cling to their god, their guns, their bibles, their religion. Few politicians have had the courage to call out the radical base of the Democratic Party, but that's why you, we, the American people elected Donald Trump in spite of what New York, California, Washington, and other liberal states wanted. And while the media mob, the Democrats attacked the president, they do compulsively, obsessively, well, the approval rating among Republicans keeps going way up. And today, new poll show the president's numbers actually increased by five points. According to another poll, 49 percent of likely voters, certainly a plurality believe the accusation of racism against President Trump are nothing more than a political ploy. That is up six percentage points over the last poll conducted. And here's why: let me help educate the radical masses. While you may not like it, the term love it, love America, leave America, there's nothing to do with race. And, by the way, it is hardly a new characteristic or concept to the loudest critics of the -- what we call dell blame America first crowd. Was it racist for Senator Kamala Harris to tell President Trump that he needs to \"go back from where he came from\"? She did that today. And get this -- in 2016, scores of celebrities, other media elites, remember they all vowed to leave the United States if President Trump was elected. Oh, yes, there are their names. Well, there is nothing racist about that. They didn't like him. The only problem, none of them actually left. Even offered a plane with caviar and champagne, but they had to promise to never come back. And tonight, when the media mob and the Democrats focused their daily attacks on the president every second, minute, hour, of every 24-hour day, it's just one pathetic last ditch effort to take the president down. They still have not accepted the 2016 election results of we, the people. A nine-month FBI investigation, we'll use the words of Lisa Page, nothing. They found nothing. Peter Strzok, no \"there\" there as it relates to a conclusion, conspiracy to conspire with Russia. The bipartisan Senate investigation -- same result, nothing. The House investigation, nothing. Mueller concluded, no conspiracy at all with Russia, no collusion. And, of course, no obstruction as per the attorney, deputy attorney general and office the legal counsel. So, their phantom charges of obstruction and collusion all fell short. And the likelihood is that one week from tonight, I am looking forward to this, when Mueller testifies before Congress, and I would even argue at this moment, if he is silly enough to testify before Congress, because he'll have to answer real questions from real Republicans, I would say the odds are very high that it will be another boomerang against the Democrats. Even if Devin Nunes is right, they are likely coordinating what they are going to say and how he's going to respond -- why do I suspect that they would do something like that? Now, what do Democrats have left in their playbook? All right, Russia, Russia, Russia. That is a dud. Obstruction, obstruction, a dud. OK, we'll try racism, racism. That will be a dud too. Let's use the playbook the Democrats use in every election season, although it's not every two and four years anymore. As I've always laid out and to show you ad after ad after ad that they aired and the history of. No, it's like every day now. You have hysteria boiling over. The Democratic Congressman Al Green, he actually launched what was the first of probably many pathetic attempts to impeach the president resoundly defeated in the House of Representatives. This is a national embarrassment. Will somebody please get these radical Democrats a Constitution and tell them to read it? If not, maybe we can have somebody read it for them. Whatever they want to, because they don't clearly understand it. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I just heard that the United States House of Representatives has overwhelmingly voted to kill the most ridiculous project I have ever been involved in, the resolution. How stupid is that? On impeachment. I want to thank those Democrats, because many of them voted for us. The vote was a totally lopsided 332-95-1. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Now, of course, Congressman Green is just doing the bidding of the new leaders of the Democratic Party. Remember this, from newly elected congresswoman, remember Tlaib, remember she said this? So nice. So welcoming and warm and inclusive. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RASHIDA TLAIB, D-MICH.: When your son looks at you and says, mama, look, you won, bullies don't win. And I said, baby, they don't, because we are going to go in there and impeach the (EXPLETIVE DELETED). (CHEERS) (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And during an interview today on CBS today, Tlaib offered no apology or retraction for her vile comments about the president of the United States. I -- why would you ever apologize for doing that? Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TLAIB: From day one, I truly believe that he has committed impeachable offenses and meet, you know -- GAYLE KING, CBS HOST: But even if you believe that, the fact that you called him -- TLAIB: But I didn't do it on the House floor. And I'm going to be unapologetic to myself. Seventy percent of Americans curse. I am real. This is who I am. I am rooted in where I have come from and it's very common for me and many of my residents to say things like that. KING: So, you don't regret -- you don't regret that? TLAIB: Absolutely not. I'm unapologetic about it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: All right. These radical Democratic Party is in a very dark, very scary place. There are no more moderates in today's extreme Democratic Party, as socialism has completely and radicalism completely taken over. Even far left liberal Nancy Pelosi, the San Francisco liberal treat, is now considered too moderate. The so-called squad is controlling all aspects of the Democratic Party's message and their platform, and anyone who gets in their way or doesn't fully support their radical dreams is accused of either bigotry or whatever, and today, Congresswoman Tlaib became the second member of the squad to actually accuse her own house speaker, Nancy Pelosi, of racism. This is number two -- two of the four with liberals that are leading in the house and influencing the 2020 Democratic candidates. Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KING: Are you speaking to Nancy Pelosi? REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: Our teams are in communication. Our chiefs are meeting -- KING: But shouldn't it be a face-to-face with you and the speaker -- TLAIB: I agree. (CROSSTALK) KING: As opposed to, as opposed to your people and her people-- OCASIO-CORTEZ: Right. KING: Shouldn't it be a face-to-face with all of you? REP. ILHAN OMAR, D-MINN.: We're missing, I think, the bigger -- TLAIB: We are new, but we are new members of Congress -- KING: I know, but I want you to answer that question -- TLAIB: But no, I'm very protective -- KING: With all due respect, she doesn't need protection. TLAIB: All right. KING: I want to know if you are speaking -- TLAIB: She's the new member, not the speaker. KING: No, but I want to know-- TLAIB: She has every right to sit down with her in any moment, anytime, with any of us. She is speaker of the House. She can ask for a meeting to sit down with us for clarification. The fact of the knowledge is -- and I've done racial justice work in our country for a long time. Acknowledge the fact that we are women of color, so when you do single us out, be aware of that and what you're doing. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Pretty serious accusation against the so-called speaker, really the speaker named only, Nancy Pelosi. And as I keep reminding you, she is now nearly a bystander in this new, radical, socialist, extreme Democratic Party, which is why she can't even defend herself from their attacks. Remember, she asked last week, if you have anything to say, say it to my face. What did AOC do? She went to Twitter and runs out publicly and attacks her again. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPORTER: Are you concerned that the president is goading you? REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: No, you know what? With all due respect, let's not waste our time on that. We are talking about what we are going to do to help the American people. Our caucus is unified on all of that. Throughout the whole campaign, I said to the candidates, don't even mention his name. Everybody knows who he is. You don't have to describe him to anybody. We are not having him set our agenda. We are setting our own agenda. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: She is not setting the agenda at all, right? Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, Omar and Pressley are running the show. The 2020 presidential hopefuls, they are all sucking up to this new leadership. Their beliefs are beyond scary, it would destroy America as we know it. We know about their dreams to turn America into a socialist eco-state known as the Green New Deal. But perhaps even more alarming are their views by some in this group of four on Israel and the Jewish people. Congresswoman Tlaib who you just saw actually wrote for Louis Farrakhan's racist anti-Semitic newspaper. She also pals around with a known bigot, her name, Linda Sarsour. In fact, Sarsour was invited guest at Tlaib's swearing in. Sarsour openly support Sharia law, blamed her bad reputation on the, quote, Jewish media. And as you can see, Congresswoman Omar also hangs out with Linda Sarsour, no surprise there. Omar has frequently tweeted anti-Semitic tropes. She once accused lawmakers of being controlled by, quote, Jewish money. Remember the phrase, it's all about the Benjamins. Omar even accused evil Israel of hypnotizing the world. But in today's interview with Gayle King, well, Congresswoman Omar said she had no regrets. She regrets nothing. Actually burst out laughing when they asked about anti-Semitism. Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OMAR: Oftentimes there are things that you might say might not hold weight for you but to someone else, right? The way that we hear and consume information is very different than how the next person might. KING: So you don't regret your words either? OMAR: I do not. KING: Would you like people to -- OMAR: And I never really wanted to-- KING: Would you want to make it clear that you are not anti-Semitic? OMAR: Oh, certainly not. Yes. KING: Would you like to make that clear? OMAR: Yes. I mean that -- nothing I said, at least to me, was meant for that purpose. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Well, at least to me. OK, well, yes, no, anti-Semitism. No laughing matter, neither is al Qaeda or the way Americans talk about those that killed 3,000 of our Americans on 9/11, or the terrorist group Hezbollah. Yet Congresswoman Omar finds apparently all that to be somewhat humorous and funny as we previously have played on this program. Now, her behavior, obvious beliefs are pretty vile, pretty sickening. Omar now plans to introduce the resolution declaring her support for the anti- Semitic BDS movement which is a boycott all things Israel. And Omar and other members of her squad are now the perfect representation of today's two-faced Democratic Party, built on selective and phony and feigned moral outrage. Each week, they call Trump, other Republicans racist, sexist, you know the routine. Yet no outrage over Omar's virulent anti-Semitism, no concern over Tlaib's work in Farrakhan's paper. Meanwhile, Democrat Ralph Northam, you know, the governor of the commonwealth of Virginia, apparently sleeping peacefully in the governor 's mansion after his fellow Democrats didn't really seem to care that he dressed up either in blackface or in a Ku Klux Klan outfit. I wonder if Donald Trump did that how they would react. 2020 Democrats are kissing the ring of Reverend Al Sharpton, who became well known for anti-Semitic bigoted language. We played a lot of it last night. Hillary Clinton's mentor, she said her mentor, Robert Byrd, used to be in the Ku Klux Klan. Al Gore's father tried to block the 1964 Civil Rights Act, that historic legislation. Lyndon Johnson relied on Republican support to get it passed. The Democrats went forward with a filibuster. The list goes on. We don't even have time to list all of the creepy, crazy, sleepy Uncle Joe's racist remarks and policies over the years. And let's talk about charges of sexual misconduct, again, selective, feigned moral outrage. Only when it's a Republican or Donald Trump or Donald Trump supporter or Donald Trump appointee. Remember that the I-believers in the Kavanaugh hearings? Well, they're nowhere to be found when a Democrat is accused of wrongdoing. Case in point, the lieutenant governor of Virginia who Gayle King interviewed, two women, one accused of a rape, another said violent sexual assault both telling people at the time he's still in office and I haven't heard a word from one of the I-believers. You got Keith Ellison. He got a promotion. Bill Clinton served two terms as president. What about the issue of Russia collusion? What, two and a half years of conspiracy theories, lies and a hoax, Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier put together by a foreign spy with funneled money filled with Russian lies as John Solomon will join us in a minute points out. Even the FBI knew 90-plus percent of it was a lie. And now, we also know that it was unverifiable, because, of course, Christopher Steele never stood behind his own dossier. I have no idea if it was true what he said under oath. And don't forget, the media just spent months hyping phantom claims of obstruction against Trump. Did any of them ever talk about Hillary's subpoenaed emails that she deleted and then the Bleach Bit to the hard drive, and acid washed the 33,000 emails, and then, of course, beating up the devices with hammers, removing SIM cards, and by the way, other evidence, all of that happening. So when you turn on conspiracy theory, Democrat state TV, either MSDNC or fake news CNN, and you hear the echo chamber and their fully typical daily freak out mode, just know that it's more selective moral outrage. They don't really care about these issues, they only care about them if they can use them to bludgeon a Republican, a conservative, or Trump or anybody that likes Trump, and nobody calls their bluff better than President Trump. Senator Lindsey Graham will join us in a moment with reaction. First, we turn to a very important story that we told you about last night. It's from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, investigative reporter. Last night, he presented an incredible new piece of evidence proving the FBI knew Christopher Steele's dirty Russian dossier that Hillary paid for was untrue, was unverifiable trash before it was used to acquire a FISA warrant against Trump campaign associate Carter Page to spy on then campaign Donald Trump, then transition team Trump and then President Trump. And according to Solomon, the FBI actually constructed a spreadsheet showing the validity of each of the dossier's lies, 90-plus percent garbage. They knew that it was garbage. They were warned before they even signed the FISA warrant it was garbage. And it is important to remember what Rod Rosenstein said about FISA warrants in May of 2018. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROD ROSENSTEIN, FORMER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: There is a lot of talk about FISA applications and many people that I see you talking about it seem not to recognize what a FISA application. A FISA application is actually a warrant, just like a search warrant. In order to get a FISA search warrant, you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information in the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. And that's the way that we operate. And if it's wrong, sometimes it is, if you find out that there is anything incorrect in there, that person is going to face consequences. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Well, face consequences, much more coming up on this story. We are joined by the executive vice president, investigative reporter from \"The Hill\", John Solomon. John, I want you to add context to texture especially in light of Rod Rosenstein's remark. If I remember correctly, didn't he sign the four FISA application? This was nine months in, the third renewal application? JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT: He did, and by my reporting last night, and the new reporting I did today, it is clear to me that at the moment, Rod Rosenstein signed the fourth FISA warrant, the FBI was acutely aware of the credibility issues with Christopher Steele. And specifically the key claim they made in all four FISA warrants that Carter Page had met with these two Russians, Igor Diveykin, and Igor Sechin. By that point, the FBI was acutely aware that those meetings likely did not happen and could not be corroborated. There is no evidence that they corrected that information before the court. So as the deputy general said there should be consequences for not disclosing that information. And I think he is accurately telling the truth. HANNITY: By Kavalec and Bruce Ohr, not only that, their own spreadsheet, they knew 90 percent of it was garbage, that is even before all of it was signed, is that what you're saying tonight? SOLOMON: Absolutely. There's not any doubt about it from my reporting today and from several members of Congress who are confirming that what I reported last night they had been told about in recent days. HANNITY: Wow. All right. John Solomon, thank you. Joining us now with reaction to our top story, and that story, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. So, Kathleen Kavalec and Bruce Ohr -- SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: Right. HANNITY: -- before the first FISA warrant was ever signed, said Steele hates Trump, Hillary paid for it, and it's unverified, but they used it anyway. GRAHAM: Right. HANNITY: And then you heard what Rod Rosenstein said. And then you just heard John Solomon's report. Help me out, Senator. It sounds to me like they premeditated conspiracy to commit fraud of the court to undo -- a first stop and then undo a presidential election, that's how the way I interpret it. GRAHAM: Well, McCabe also said, without the dossier, there would have been no warrant issued against Carter Page. So, McCabe says under oath, it was outcome determinative. And everything you said about the garbage nature of the dossier I think is true, but this is when we had Mr. Horwitz looking into this. And I can't wait until he tells us what he found. HANNITY: Yes. All right. So, where do you go with this? Because you are the one guy that can bring them all in. GRAHAM: Right. And I really do hope, Senator, that the people that did this were also involved in rigging the investigation into Hillary. The evidence is pretty overwhelming she violated the Espionage Act and then she obstructed justice from my little -- you know, my little TV studio, the little that I know about these things. GRAHAM: Well, I want to ask Comey, what did you tell the president in January of 2017? Here is the dossier, we don't -- I can't verify it, why don't you know about it? And he used the same document and told the court that it was reliable on four different occasions. I want to know when McCabe reaffirmed again that without the dossier, there'd be no warrant. I want to find out, did Papadopoulos tell them upfront that, you know, if I was working with the Russians, that would be a crime and I would never do that. I want to know a bunch of things. HANNITY: I want to know a lot. OK, so you're going to get to the bottom of all of that. Let me ask you this question. So, we've got new leadership. The 2020 Democratic hopefuls all seem to be reacting to and adopting the policies of the squad, as I guess they are called now. GRAHAM: Right. HANNITY: And I think -- I look at the New Green Deal, and I look at every Democrat saying yes, Medicare-for-All, everything is free, no oil, no gas, no combustion engine, planes or cows, and I say, OK, that's the end of the United States as we know it if that is ever implemented. GRAHAM: Yes. So, their policy choices would devastate free enterprise. It would make us weak. It'd be the end of Israel as we know it. It would be devastating to the American way of life, our prosperity and our future. Compare that to what Trump is doing. Name one person in my lifetime that has been a better friend to Israel. We've got the strongest economy in decades, and we got the military on par with what Ronald Reagan did. And we got a foreign policy that makes sense. I think compare and contrast campaign is going to lead to a very big Trump victory. HANNITY: OK. So, do you think in the time that Donald Trump has been elected until now, do you think that he has lost any, if -- or some of the supporters? They seem pretty passionate in North Carolina, and do you think maybe the best employment situation since 1969 and record low unemployment for all of these very -- demographic groups, when you break down, some traditionally vote Democratic -- do you think he's got a shot at those voters now? GRAHAM: Here's what I think. I think that he has united the Republican Party. Every corner of the party believes that President Trump is doing a great job with a few outliers. If you're a strong national security guy, he's like Reagan. If you believe in cutting taxes as a conservative Republican, he did it. If you believe in conservative judges, nobody has done better. So, from a Republican point of view, you don't have a lot to complain about. Compare that to our friends on the other side who are cracking up. HANNITY: All right. Senator, how you really feel. GRAHAM: Yes. HANNITY: All right. Headline, Lindsey Graham on \u201cHannity.\u201d All right. I can see that you really want to agree with that and to revise and extend your remarks. Thank you, Senator. When we come back, media fawning over the squad. They love the squad. We've got the tape to prove it. We'll get reaction, Jeff Lord, Joe Concha. Jim Jordan, Gregg Jarrett weigh in on this huge big breaking news from John Solomon. We've got a lot of ground to cover. We're glad that you are with us. News you won't get anywhere else, I'll tell you that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: And I have to say this, and I'll say it just once. What happened to me with this witch hunt should never be allowed to happen to another president of the United States. Never, ever again. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: The president earlier tonight, North Carolina, slamming the two- and-a-half year Russia witch hunt. Of course, left wing political cast does not stop there, because also tonight, Democrats voted to hold the Attorney General Bill Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt over the controversy about asking about citizenship on the census, which isn't being asked on the census. Here with reaction is Congressman Jim Jordan, and the author of the upcoming book, a sequel to his number one bestseller \"Witch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in America Political History\", FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. You know, the president is right here, but I only see one way in preventing that. And we have had issues with the CIA in the past, and the Church Committee, et cetera. And I guess I ask you -- how do we possibly prevent it, Jim Jordan, if, in fact, the people that were involved in all of this -- REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OH: Yes. HANNITY: -- based on the reporting of John Solomon, are not held accountable? JORDAN: Read Emmet Flood's letter, if they can do it to a president of the United States, imagine what they can do to you and me, or to any of our constituents, anyone in this country. That is scary. Understand this about the dossier. John Solomon's reporting is so good. Understand this -- when James Comey said it was salacious and unverified, it turns out that was an understatement. It was complete garbage. Yet they took it to the court and but for that dossier, Andy McCabe told us this in his deposition, they don't get the warrant. Final point on this is, when Jim Baker, the Chief Counsel of the FBI and we deposed him, Sean, we asked him why - he told us he reviewed this FISA, normally he didn't review FISA. This is one of the very few he reviewed. We asked him why. He said, because I knew I'd be sitting in a committee room like this someday. They knew from the start this thing was a problem and they did it anyway. And as the President said, if they can do it to a President of the United States in his campaign, imagine what they can do to you and me. HANNITY: So, they were warned Jim Jordan before they sign the first warrant and warned about - it's not verified, it's political. Hillary paid for it. And that Steele hates no one before. Now we know according to this report tonight that the FBI knew before they signed the warrant. JORDAN: Yes. HANNITY: They knew then that 90 plus percent was BS. JORDAN: Yes. HANNITY: And Baker's comments are key. Now we also had Jim Comey. Yes, you're right. He signed the October 2016 FISA application. And then in January 2017, he told the President it's salacious and unverified and he might have signed a second one the month before, Gregg Jarrett would know that not me. JORDAN: Yes, they signed three more Sean. And they even signed one, renewed the third FISA renewal happens after Bob Mueller is already named Special Counsel. So, they did it. They surveilled an American citizen for the better part of a year on something that was complete bogus. HANNITY: Gregg. GREGG JARRETT, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Congressman Jordan is absolutely correct and all those people who signed off on it from Rod Rosenstein to Andrew McCabe, Sally Yates and James Comey, they were lying to a court and that's a felony. It's a crime, in fact, it's five other felonies as well. And it will not be enough for people like James Comey to say, I put my name on that, but I was trusting in the work of others. That is not a defense to defrauding the court because he fixes his name for a reason. He is swearing under oath that the information he is providing is authentic, it is true, and it is verified. So, Comey and the other people I mentioned are in a world of trouble. I guarantee you that Horowitz, the Inspector General has the goods on them. HANNITY: Now, Jim Jordan, one week from tonight, we expect - we've already booked you to be on this program as a guest. You will be here hopefully one week from tonight. If Mueller testifies Now, why do I think like everything else involving all of this, I suspect that what the Democrats are fearful of now and we are beginning to see that fear emerge. First of all, they don't want Republicans to ask questions which is amazing because the rules say they must know. JORDAN: Yes. HANNITY: What I think is going to happen here is Mueller has already said what he has to say, he'll refer to the documents. JORDAN: Right. HANNITY: Unless David Nunes is right and they're kind of talking with each other which would not be a good thing, but you're going to ask questions, aren't you - won't you have an opportunity to ask questions to Robert Mueller. JORDAN: Yes. HANNITY: What are the things that you think you might be going into without giving away every detail. JORDAN: Yes. No, look, we're working on that. The whole committee, all the Republican committee we're meeting trying to figure out what's the best approach to take. But I will tell you this, he did sign that for FISA. Well, Bob Mueller didn't sign it, but they signed it after he's named Special Counsel. I think that's significant. I'm sure someone's going to ask about that question. But there is a whole bunch of others we want to get into as well. HANNITY: And Gregg Jarrett if you remember Congress what would you most want to ask? JARRETT: Well, I would certainly ask that question. But I'd want to know why didn't you recuse yourself when the President in the Oval Office talked to you about his reasons for firing James Comey, the day before you took the job to investigate the President. Under regulations, you can't be a prosecutor and a witness in the same case. HANNITY: Great point. All right. Let's see if he shows up a week from tonight. I don't know if he's going to show. When we come back, Joe Concha, Jeff Lord, they're going to weigh in on your corrupt fawning media, fawning all over the squad. That's next. Also, later, the woman who is going to challenge, that's right, Ocasio-Cortez, the real Speaker of the House will join us. First interview, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. As we have predicted, mainstream corrupt media mob running interference for the squad and their feud with the President. They can't help themselves. Why? Because they're state TV. You've got conspiracy TV, MSDNC and fake news CNN. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I felt we're very impressive. They're very committed. They're very passionate. They are very committed to making change that they think is better for the constituents who elected them. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A lot of people believe that the right of Americans is to criticize the country, not being criticized by the governor. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's why they threw the tea in Boston Harbor. It's kind of the very beginning, the very beginning of the American experiment is that you have the right to complain. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The women at the center of the controversy say Republicans are putting the President first. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Other than endangering the lives of these four Congresswomen that he targeted in those racist tweets. Do you believe he's putting - do you believe he'd have blood on his hands if there were a racially inspired attack? (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Now, get this fake news CNN. They did a focus group with conservative women voters about how they feel about the controversy. And they're not buying the fake news media narrative that CNN had to hear this. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DENA MILLER, REPUBLICAN: He was saying that if they hate America so much because what we're seeing out of them and hearing out of them, they hate America. If it's so bad. There's a lot of places they can go. SHARON BOLAN, REPUBLICAN: I'm a brown skinned woman. I am a legal immigrant. I agree with you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You don't think that's racist. GINA O'BRIANT, REPUBLICAN: Not at all. I'm glad that the President said what he said, because all they're doing is, they're inciting hatred and division. And that's not what our country is about. It's not about that at all. And I don't-- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Isn't what the President does with some of his own comments, his own racist comments. O'BRIANT: But he didn't say anything about color. MILLER: Why are they not racist? How come they haven't befriended one of their white female congresswoman colleagues and her-- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because they won't. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Here now with reaction, author of Swamp Wars, the bestseller. Conservative columnist Jeffrey Lord. And from The Hill, media reporter Joe Concha. Good to see you both. You know, I look at the YouGov poll, Jeff Lord, and I find it reveals majority Republicans, 88 percent support the President. And by the way, that's five points higher than it once was. And then you have another poll out there that, yes, that's pretty much the same thing. The rest views and poll, they like it a lot because they feel like they're trying to use it to bludgeon the President yet again. And that's the feeling. JEFFREY LORD, AUTHOR, SWAMP WARS: Well, that's right. I mean, and the reason is pretty obvious to anybody who doesn't have blinders on, the President is out there as he was tonight standing up for America and the squad so-called is out there trying to divide Americans by race, which comes from the culture of their political party for 219 years. On the record for slavery, segregation, lynching the Klan. Now, it's identity politics. The son of segregation. It's all racist. And the American people don't like it. And they know exactly what's going on with the President, and so they stand up with him. HANNITY: You know, Joe, every two and four years for a long time, every election cycle, I would always play pasts elections where the race card is played. But now it seems like it's not just every two and four years. Now it's like every second of every day. That's just, you know, normal course of being for the Democrats. But what's so interesting to me is not only are the Democrats and the 2020 hopefuls, they are sucking up to the squad and more importantly, adopting these extreme policies and the so-called leadership of the Democratic Party seems powerless and afraid. JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER OF THE HILL: I'm not sure why they're afraid, Sean, considering that the squad is not pulling in almost every poll that I've seen well and look-- HANNITY: Well, that's not fair. CONCHA: OK. HANNITY: Omar has a 9 percent approval rating and Ocasio-Cortez with 22 percent. You're not being fair. We're calling you out on that. CONCHA: Well, thank you for that. I appreciate that. Look, everything comes down to race these days, right. And you said that every second of every day you're hearing about the race card. This week we almost saw that literally. Do you know that since Sunday-- HANNITY: Well, I'm saying we're hearing about hating Trump, whatever manifestation it is for that second? CONCHA: Oh, no, I hear you, Sean. But I'm saying that there is an actual number around this now that since Sunday, according to Gray Beard Media (ph), the word racist has been said on CNN and MSNBC alone more than 2200 times. I don't even know if that's physically or mathematically possible, but that's what's been happening this week and has been the myopic focus completely. And that's for the squad. Look, the media loves nicknames, right? I mean, I guess the dream team was taken from the 92 team with Charles and Burton Magic. So, they went with the JV squad here instead. And we saw it with Ocasio-Cortez from the very beginning. She was on the cover of Time magazine five minutes after she was sworn into office called The Phenom. She got a 60 Minutes interview only a couple of weeks after taking office. And she even got a town hall on MSNBC before all the other presidential candidates did. HANNITY: It's MSDNC, get it right. CONCHA: A lot of corrections going on in the segment now. Certainly, you toss it back to-- HANNITY: Correct. CONCHA: To Jeffrey Lord please. Thank you. HANNITY: OK, Jeff. LORD: Sean, look. HANNITY: I mean we could just tell Joe to be on time. No offense. Go ahead. CONCHA: It's a lot of rain out here. So, give me a little slack. It's monsoon in Manhattan. HANNITY: OK. LORD: The number that Joe cited is just absolutely incredible. And I have a column coming out on this tomorrow in The American Spectator. I mean, when you've got CNN and MSNBC standing up for people who are self-identified as anti-Semites and racist, that's pretty bad. HANNITY: Well, again, how - the question is, has Trump lost voters from 2016? You look at the enthusiasm in North Carolina tonight. And record low unemployment, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment. One has to wonder if people say, wow, we're doing a lot better than 30 million more Americans on food stamps and 8 million more in poverty under Biden. Obama. All right, guys, good to see you. CONCHA: Independence are the whole key, Sean, though, independence. HANNITY: Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez has a formidable new rival. Republican wants to take her seat in Congress. That woman challenging AOC will join us next. Also, Lawrence Jones asking New Yorkers, what do they think of AOC? We've got the tape straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right, the new extreme Left is running the Democratic Party from the economy, killing, Green New Deal, higher taxes, open borders, amnesty and a new crop of radicals led by Congresswoman, the real Speaker, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. They are setting the agenda. And by the way, want to talk about a dumpster fire, a far-Left radical socialism which fails every single time, it is tried. By the way, my invitation to Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman continues. I'd like her to spend an hour right here on this set. We'll talk about every issue. We'll take our time or offer three hours on 618 of the best radio stations if she'll come. Here's just a small sample of what we have seen from the real speaker so far. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change. And your biggest issue is - your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it? How many years until the world ends again? We have 12 years left to cut emissions by at least 50 percent, if not more. Medicare for All would save the American people, a very large amount of money. Maybe we shouldn't be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner. You mean more than 10 million in one year? Your 10 millionth and one dollar gets taxed at 70 percent. Capitalism has not always existed in the world, and it will not always exist in the world. Should - is it OK to still have children? But we're here to say that an agency like ICE, which repeatedly and systematically violates human rights does not deserve a dime. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Today we learned that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is also facing a serious challenge in New York's 14th District because rising GOP star, Scherie Murray is an immigrant and entrepreneur. She announced her candidacy today. This is her first interview. Thank you, ma'am, for being with us. We appreciate you joining us. Thank you. SCHERIE MURRAY, R-NY, CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: It's a pleasure to be with you this evening, Sean. HANNITY: You know, you just heard what she said. And we have 12 years. It doesn't matter how we're going to pay for it. 12 years left and we shouldn't be eating hamburgers for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I don't know anybody that does that and the concentration camp, et cetera, comments and everything that you just heard. What is your reaction? MURRAY: Well, it's disgusting. I think the narrative on the national level, it needs to be dialed back. And that's why I'm in the race. I'd like to represent the constituents in Queens, and the Bronx. And we see AOC from the time she's been elected. She put out policy like the job killing, Green New Deal. She then went on to kill the Amazon deal in New York, which would have put some 25,000 jobs in Queens. And so, these are some of the reasons along with kitchen table issues that I do believe that AOC has neglected in her limelight bid to focus on in the congressional district. HANNITY: Those 25,000 jobs in the district, you're running against her. An average pay 150 grand. I did think the governor and the Mayor of New York were crazy and their giveaways. And I think it's unfair to give benefits to one company and not another company. But that's a different story. But saying, do we have to question having kids? They did say the Green New Deal, whether you're willing or unwilling to work. Basically, everything is for free. No more oil or gas in 10 years. I don't understand it. If we only have 12 years left and we have to do this all in 10 years, why don't we just party the next 12 years and it's over anyway? MURRAY: Well, Sean, you have some points there. And I do believe that we have to start talking about the issues that are important to the constituents of the 14th Congressional District in Queens and in the Bronx. We have infrastructure that is important to the constituents. Our subway system is crumbling. Our roads are in desperate need of repair. Also, Sean, our education, we need to really tackle our education system. The diversity here in New York, the education system, we really need to start talking about policy that's going to connect with the everyday Americans. She mentions no children, right. Or kids. I'm a mom-- HANNITY: Let me ask you this, how would you describe yourself politically and how do you feel about President Trump in the two plus years or two and a half years he's been in office? MURRAY: Well, I migrated here from Jamaica, and I know firsthand what it is to not just be an immigrant, but to go through the process. Right. And so, what do I think about what the President is doing? I think that the President is delivering on his promises when he got elected. HANNITY: Well, so you are announcing your candidacy and we're going to watch this very closely. I have noticed that a lot of people in the district diverse. 25,000 jobs, $150,000 on average. She let that go. I don't think that was a good move. MURRAY: Sean, I just want to get all of your viewers to go to my website so that they can learn a little bit more about-- HANNITY: What is it, real quick. MURRAY: About me. scheriemurray.com. Follow me on Twitter. It's been overwhelming the level of support that I've received so far. The enthusiasm. So, I just want to say, thank you to all of your viewers and everyone out there that has just encouraged this campaign on our launch today. Thank you, Sean. HANNITY: Scherie Murray, thank you for being with us. We'll follow your campaign very closely. Coming up, a horrific story over California. Over 20 MS-13 gang members arrested in what prosecutors are describing as a medieval style slaying. Trace Gallagher. Full report. Straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. A gruesome story tonight out of California. Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast Newsroom with the very latest. Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: Sean, of the 22 MS-13 gang members arrested for a series of brutal murders recently in Southern California. Federal investigators say, 19 of them are in the country illegally and all 19 came within the last few years that of course mirrors the timeline that California has been fighting to support sanctuary cities and fighting against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The feds say the way MS-13 gang members rise in the ranks is by committing murders. And they are now accused of systematically and viciously killing at least seven people, using medieval style killing techniques that law enforcement authorities have not seen in two decades. One victim was killed for crossing out MS-13 graffiti. Another was a homeless man who made the fatal mistake of falling asleep in a park that MS-13 considers its turf. The 22 gang members arrested are also thought to be responsible for hundreds of other crimes in several other states. But they are all based here in Los Angeles. Sean. HANNITY: Chilling. All right, Trace Gallagher in our West Coast Newsroom. Thank you. All right. Thank you as well for being with us. We'll never be the hate-Trump, psychotic media mob. Let not your heart be troubled.

      "content": "This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" July 18, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right, Tucker. Great show as always. Everybody, buckle up. Welcome to \u201cHannity.\u201d Tonight, we are tracking multiple breaking news stories, including a bombshell new discovery from Judicial Watch, showing what is a possible link between Obama and officials and the Russia collusion witch hunt in the fall of 2016. This is big news, what have always we been saying? What did Obama know? What did Biden know? When did they know it? We'll also have the very latest on the radical, socialist, anti-Semitic lawmakers that are running the show of the Democratic Party. But first, big news tonight out of the Persian Gulf. Today, the president announced a U.S. Navy ship destroyed a uranium drone over the Straits of Hormuz. Boom! Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: The Boxer took defensive action against an Iranian drone which had closed into a very, very near distance, approximately 1,000 yards, ignoring multiple calls to stand down and was threatening the safety of the ship and the ship's crew. The drone was immediately destroyed. This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Now, mark my words on this, the president -- there will be no shipment of $150 billion of cash and other currency and cargo planes being delivered to the mullahs of Iran, that was the Obama-Biden era. There's not going to be any bribery, no appeasement. And the world's leading sponsor of terror, those who chant \"death to America, death to Israel,\" burn the American flag, the Israeli flag, they must never, ever be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. Here now with the very latest, our very own Trace Gallagher in the West Coast newsroom tonight -- Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: Sean, this happen in international waters just as the USS Boxer, an amphibious assault ship was leading the Strait of Hormuz and entering the Persian Gulf. The Pentagon says that the unmanned aerial vehicle began closing on the Boxer within 1,000 yards and ignored numerous calls to stand down. That's when the ship took defensive action and used that anti-drone electronic jamming device which effectively render the drone useless and brought it down. Today, the Iranian foreign minister issued a statement saying that his country has no information about losing a drone. This, of course, is just the latest event that could lead to a military confrontation. In recent months, Iran has been accused of attacking oil tankers and shooting down an American drone. After the drone shot down, President Trump ordered a retaliatory strike, but called it off at the last moment. It's also notable that earlier today, Iran said it's Revolutionary Guard seized a foreign oil tanker and its crew for smuggling fuel out of the country. That shape appears to be from the United Arab Emirates -- Sean. HANNITY: All right. Trace Gallagher, we'll continue to update you throughout the hour. Very interesting, remember when the American drone was shot down, all of the people on the left, the Democrats, the media mob, what were they saying? Oh, my gosh, Trump is going to start World War III. Here's the president -- steady, in control, and on top of it all, no briberies, no cash payments to radical mullahs that, of course, chant \"death to America\". We turn now to a brand-new story out of the deep state, because just moments ago, Judicial Watch published a trove of documents and e-mails from Obama State Department, including one exchange from a top State Department official, Victoria Nuland, and a close associate of Christopher Steele. This is from September of 2016. Nuland wanted to discuss, quote, the Russian matter face-to-face. One more piece of evidence that numerous officials at the highest levels of the Obama administration were desperate to get something, anything on President Trump. They knew, they were warned about Christopher Steele, they knew he hated Trump. They knew Hillary paid for the dossier, and they knew that it was unverified. The FBI was warned twice before the first FISA application that James Comey signed. The DOJ knew, the State Department knew, they all knew about the glaring red flags, what is now what we now know to be unverifiable material, Steele's rampant bias, Russian lies, the stories that never added up from the beginning. But they use those Hillary Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies to what? First, well, leak to the American people through hacks and conspiracy theorists like Michael Isikoff, and \"The Washington Post\" and David Corn to impact to the election. And then, of course, they were spying, not only on the Trump campaign, but then the Trump transition and then the Trump presidency, four warrants of full year of spying. Members of your government, they used this trash, these Russian lies, even \"The New York Times\" saying from the beginning, it was likely Russian disinformation to obtain FISA warrants to directly spy on one American, denying that American his several liberties, his civil rights, and using it as a catalyst to what has now been a never-ending witch hunt, lies, conspiracy theories, a hoax, and the media mob peddling those lies and conspiracy theories for two-plus years along with a Democratic friends. Four separate investigations, no collusion. But now, they want a fifth and sixth investigation. This, though, is the tip of the iceberg. This might go right to the White House of Barack Obama, and the vice president's office, Joe Biden. Here with more, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. Tom, to me, this is a breakthrough. We have and asking the question how high up, we know that the deep state actors are now turning on each other, Page, Strzok are pointing the finger at then Attorney General Loretta Lynch. And we've got, of course, James Baker saying, I knew from the beginning this was a bad idea. Then, of course, you've got the deputy FBI Director McCabe saying, we would not have gotten a FISA warrants without the dossier, the dirty dossier, the unverifiable dossier. And then you have Brennan and Clapper hating Comey, and Comey and McCabe going at each other. So I would assume between all that infighting and all the finger-pointing and what is a civil war and circulatory firing squad, I think we're going to get to the truth finally. TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH PRESIDENT: Well, certainly now we need to expand the investigation into the Obama State Department. Jonathan Winer, who was close to Christopher Steele, the Russia -- I mean, the Libya expert for John Kerry State Department was shepherding Steele and actually helping him write the dossier or a part of it that was laundered into the FBI and Justice Department. The Steele dossier was written in part, according to Winer, he admitted this in the op-ed in \"The Washington Post,\" he admitted that he helped write a summary of other material he was getting from the Clinton gang and then laundered it through Steele to the DOJ and FBI. This new e-mail show that he was in communication with Victoria Nuland and they wanted to meet in New York about the Russian matter. We were suing for Russia-gate documents related to Steele. So, we know it's about that. And this meeting took place almost simultaneously with a meeting that Glenn Simpson had with the State Department about to Russia- gate as well. Remember Victoria Nuland had blessed the meetings between the FBI and Christopher Steele in the U.K. of the summer of 2016, and that other documents show that she was working with Steny Hoyer's office to get this Russia material through, and then pushing classified information to make Trump look bad just before the inauguration. The State Department is at the center of the storm in terms of the abuses of the Obama administration against then candidate Trump, and then the incoming president, Mr. Trump. HANNITY: So, we know this. We know that Bruce Ohr and Kathleen Kavalec all warned about the dossier bought and paid for, and unverifiable, Steele's agenda before the first FISA warrant application when in. At the top of the FISA warrant, I am told, it says verified. Comey signed it anyway. Then John Solomon's report which, of course, is -- the FBI had their own spreadsheet. Even they knew that to 90 percent of it was garbage. So, then on top of this, now we are seeing just how high up it goes. Do you think we get to the question of when did Obama know it? When did he know it? FITTON: Well, the big meeting occurred just before Comey went and ambushed then candidate Trump with the dossier in January 2017. There was an Oval Office meeting where Comey brought up the dossier with Mr. Obama, Mr. Biden, Susan Rice was there. And I think Brennan was there. So, they all discuss the dossier. Susan Rice was there as well. Obama knew about the dossier and the text messages between Strzok and Page. The White House wanted to know about this. Look, when it came to going after Trump on the dossier and the Obama administration, it was all hands on deck and was orchestrated out of the White House. And I think the big issue is for the media and investigators, why isn't President Obama being asked to serious questions about this? HANNITY: Not one time, very interesting. I know sleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Biden is going to be asked at some point. Tom Fitton, great work as always. Judicial Watch. Now, this weekend, the president called out the radical socialist new leaders in the Democratic Party in a huge way. He rebuked a lot of the anti-American comments, essentially told them -- love it or leave it, and when you fix a country you came from, well, then you can come back and show us. There's been a lot of media mob Democratic outrage. But today, the president after last night, he denounced the chant that called for Congresswoman Omar to be sent back. Here's what he said. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I disagree with it, by the way. But it was quite a chance, and I felt a little bit badly about it. But I will say this, I did, and I started speaking very clearly, but it started up rather fast as you probably noticed. REPORTER: So, you will tell your supporters never -- TRUMP: Well, I would say that I -- I was not happy with it. I disagree with it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: As I said last night, \"love it or leave it\" is not a new concept that has been discussed in the country. There's a big difference between love it and leave it and send somebody back who is a citizen. The president -- well, he was right in that sense. And I disagree vehemently with Congresswoman Omar. But I also understand something that I think is a lot deeper here, and that is who is Congresswoman Omar? Why has she said that things that she has said? She is an American citizen duly elected to serve her district. She belongs in Congress because she is duly elected as much as any other person. Her views are downright scary. We do have a duty to call them out, especially since she and other members of the so-called \"Squad\" are now the brain trust of the Democratic Party. They are the only ones that seem to be influencing the Democratic 2020 candidates. The 2020 candidates are all adopting some version of the Green New Deal. And this week, Congresswoman Omar again, more controversy introducing a BDS resolution, calling for the boycott of Israel, the only democracy in the region, one of our closest allies. Now, keep in mind, Omar vehemently opposes sanctions against the world's leading sponsor of terror, Iran, the people that fight and fund terrorism like Hezbollah and fight proxy wars and kill Americans in Iraq. Ever call for the boycott of them. She also opposes sanctions against the Maduro dictatorship in Venezuela. Yet here she is advocating for sanctions in Congress against our biggest ally, the only democracy in the Middle East. And the resolution, she actually took it a step further on top of other things that she has said, she compared Israel to Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, apartheid South Africa. Now, this is -- this BDS resolution that is now evidence of two things, one, Congresswoman Omar, frankly, the evidence is incontrovertible. She is bigoted. She is an anti-Semite, in my opinion. No surprise there. Constantly using anti-Semitic tropes on Twitter, hangs out with radicals like Linda Sarsour, who supports Sharia law, and she once accused Israel of hypnotizing the world. She claimed that lawmakers were being controlled by, quote, Jewish money. It's all about the Benjamin's. Number two, this BDS bill is one more piece of evidence that Speaker Pelosi, speaker in name only, when she has zero power over the radical caucus of these freshman congresswomen, remember, in the last two weeks, she has been pretty much called racist twice by two separate members of the, quote, \"squad.\" And four months ago, Pelosi declared that the BDS movement was bigoted. She said it was bigoted and dangerous. We have the tape to prove it. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: I simply declared to be anti-Semitic is to be anti-American. It has no place in our country. We must also be vigilant against bigoted or dangerous ideologies masquerading as policy. And that includes BDS. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Then remember, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats -- they were scared to death to actually call out the congresswoman by name. Remember the watered down condemnation, we'll condemn everybody, but they were supposed to go after her. But again, more selective moral outrage, everything we get from Democrats these days. And a freshman lawmaker in her party is advocating for a policy that Nancy Pelosi herself called racist, dangerous, and anti-American. If Speaker Pelosi had any control over her party, she would come out and denounce Omar by name right now. That's not going to happen. Her speakership, she knows, hangs in the balance. In the past week alone, members of \"The Squad\" twice now called Pelosi racist. Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley demanded that all minorities get on board with her radical ideas or get out of the Democratic Party. Of course, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez said no one is heartbroken at the prospect of losing private health insurance, and she wants to get rid of the Department of Homeland Security on top of the Green New Deal that every 2020 Democratic hopefuls signing onto. And Congresswoman Tlaib doubled down on her promise to impeach the MF-er in the Oval Office. She said that on day one. And Congresswoman Omar told Gayle King of CBS that she doesn't regret any of her anti-Semitic language. These lawmakers are now defining the Democratic Party. One recent poll showing that Omar has a whopping 9 percent approval rating among voters in swing districts. The same poll showing that socialism was viewed in a positive light by a whopping 18 percent of voters. Pelosi has been in politics quite a while. She knows that \"The Squad\" is political poison as radical left as Pelosi is. Let me reiterate, she is now powerless to stop them. Here with more on the future of Omar's resolution is our own Capitol Hill senior reporter, Chad Pergram is with us -- Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, SENIOR CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Good evening, Sean. Well, Ilhan Omar's resolution does not specifically mention Israel or the BDS movement. Omar frames this around free speech and First Amendment rights. Republican New York Representative Lee Zeldin slammed Omar. Zeldin accuses Omar of bringing, quote, her hateful twist, propping up the BDS movement and blaming Israel. Zeldin notes that Israel is the best ally the U.S. has in the Middle East. Now, also sponsoring Omar's resolution is her fellow member of the squad. That's Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib. Tlaib is the first female Palestinian American lawmaker in the Congress. Now, it's unclear if the House would ever consider the resolution. A lot of times, members just introduced resolutions and bills important to them or their districts even if it is not going anywhere. Some Democrats think this is a bad time to bring up such a resolution that could set up a clash because the president just united Democrats with his attack on the squad and Democrats don't want to drive a wedge through their caucus. This comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could bar Omar and Tlaib from entering Israel. The Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell today criticized the House for not approving what he called, quote, straightforward resolutions condemning anti-Semitism. McConnell says the House won't deal with a measure like that because it is a tough vote. Sean, back to you. HANNITY: All right, Chad. Thank you, from Washington tonight. Tonight, there are now multiple polls showing just how unpopular \"The Squad\" has become. A new Economist poll has the approval ratings of Congresswoman Tlaib, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, and Omar well underwater. Here know what the reaction to all of this is Fox News contributor, our friend Dan Bongino. You know, I look at -- let's take Congresswoman Omar for just a second here, because that's who the president said, OK, we know what the laws are in Somalia. If you in any way contribute to an abortion or have one, you are going to jail. If you happen to be gay or lesbian, you're going to jail. Draconian laws that contradict American values. And I suspect when the president said, OK, you can go back there and then come back and show us how, I think there was a certain amount of, do you realize how great we are compared to countries like Somalia? DAN BONGINO, CONTRIBUTOR: Sean, the odd thing about Representative Omar is that she -- her story is the American Dream. I mean, do you get it? She comes to the country as a refugee. The country takes her in and embraces her, elects her to the United States Congress, pays her a healthy salary, gives her power, the accoutrements of office, right? And yet, she turns around after this wonderful opportunity of what will be a fantastic story otherwise and then in every opportunity seems to take a gut shot at the United States of America. Now, listen, I get the criticism of some of the language on both -- whatever. You -- I don't mind a political fistfight. Some people do. That's your thing. But can you at least see it from the liberal -- listen, because I know that you watch this show. Can you see it as reasonable that hardworking Americans who love this country would be like, is there even a moment of gratitude where you say to yourself, gosh, I'm glad to be in the United States in the position that I am because this story, Sean, is not replicable anywhere else on the planet. HANNITY: Hey, Dan, when there was al-Shabaab's terrorist attack on a Kenyan shopping mall, remember, she blamed America's involvement in other people's affairs for the cause. No, we did not cause terrorists to act. When you compare Israel to Iran and Nazi Germany, and Ocasio-Cortez was claiming, making an analogy about concentration camps and then voting against improving the conditions, which is a little bit ironic. But I think the worst thing that Omar has done is she is laughing at the idea, oh, the way that Americans pronounce the words al Qaeda after 3,000 of our fellow citizens were slaughtered that day. People jumping out of the windows of the Trade Center towers. Then, of course, the Pentagon, and the hijacked plane into the Pentagon. And then, of course, the field in Pennsylvania. There is nothing funny to me about the way that we pronounce al Qaeda. Not one bit. And you don't compare Israel to Iran and Nazi Germany. And just like you don't compare the detention centers where people were given food, water, medicine, cots, blankets, baby formula, and supplies to death camps in Nazi Germany. That's what we have from \"The Squad.\" BONGINO: Sean, Representative Omar and Representative Tlaib as well aren't even hiding open anti-Semitism anymore. They're not hiding it. Let's be crystal clear. This BDS movement is targeted at Jews in Israel. Not Muslims in Israel. It is pathologically a discriminatory measure at its nature. They openly support this. They pal around with Linda Sarsour. Have you heard some of the stuff, the vile stuff coming out of the mouth of Linda Sarsour? HANNITY: The one that supports Sharia? That one? BONGINO: Exactly, I mean, these are pictures that would be devastating to a GOP or conservative candidate if somebody with the resume of Linda Sarsour was photographed with you. HANNITY: So, let me ask you this question -- BONGINO: But the media doesn't want to do any homework. It's over. Yes. HANNITY: So, when the president said, and he actually tweeted out, which I thought was interesting in the media would never talk about, it is up to people to decide whether to stay or leave. He is very clear about that. But she comes from a country where abortion is imprisonment or even assisting in such, where if you say anything bad about Islam, you are going to jail. If you happen to be gay, you are going to jail, and the president says, all right, go fix that country of origin, you are a citizen, he said, it is up to you if you want to stay or go, but then you can come back and tell us how to fix this place after you fix that place. I think the people of North Carolina were taking, I don't think they were saying send her back as much as they were saying, these views are repugnant. BONGINO: Sean, I think there is a large portion of America that is tired of this. Listen, we are a country that has had our flaws. We have our battle scars. You know, we lost hundreds of thousands of men defeating the scourge of slavery in the initiation of our country. But we have come so far. And people like Omar succeed in the United States with a uniquely American dream. And people are tired of having this country crapped on constantly by far leftist that can't admit that overall we're a great place. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: That's what the people were chanting last night in North Carolina about how outrageous, this is a country that has opened its hearts to people from every country around the world. Was that what they were angry about? BONGINO: I think so. I think we take millions of people come in the most benevolent country on earth. I would not say send her back. I think the president has spoken out about that as well. HANNITY: He did. BONGINO: But I get why people would be upset. And I wish liberals would understand our position like we try to understand theirs. HANNITY: Dan Bongino, thank you. My friend Barry Farber says, there's never been a country in the history of man that has accumulated more power and abuse at less than this country. I add to that, never been in country in the history of man that has accumulated more power, abused it less, used it to advance the entire human condition, and used it to spread liberty and freedom more than this. We paid the price. A great country. Greatest country God gave man. When we come back, prominent Democrats starting to get extremely worried about the squad's influence over their party. Karl Rove, Mike Huckabee. Later the great one, Mark Levin, he's got a lot to say tonight, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Right now as the new extreme left takes control of the Democratic Party, some prominent liberals are already sounding the alarm. Just listen to Obama strategist David Axelrod lay out his theory. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID AXELROD, FORMER OBAMA SENIOR ADVISER: If you listen to what he and other -- his strategists are talking about, they want to paint a portrait of the Democratic Party as a far left socialist party for open borders and so on. And so, these women, these young members of Congress have now taken that place. And I think that he saw a chance in the fight between Pelosi and them to elevate them. And I think that they believe that there are still more votes out there that they did not get in 2016 in their base, and that if they turn up the temperature that they can mobilize them even further. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Also get this, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez tonight is also out there promoting her radical green agenda, and using this summer's heat, imagine that, heat in summer as evidence of climate change. You can't make this up. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: There's a lot of times people will say, climate change does not affect me as we are sweltering hot in the middle of D.C. summer. In New York, we are about to -- you know, when I head back to New York, we are about to land in one of the biggest heat waves that we've had in very recently. We are about to hit 110 degrees this summer, this weekend, in New York City, and it's only July. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: It may get cold in August, who knows? Wow, weather changes. I am shocked. Here with reaction, Fox News contributors Karl Rove and former Governor Mike Huckabee. All right. Both of you guys have been in a lot of elections and I'm listening to all this, and I'm watching all of this. And the New Green Deal and the new leadership of the Democratic Party, how does this play out? Governor, we'll start with you tonight. MIKE HUCKABEE, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, David Axelrod is half right when he says that this is exposing just how socialist and how far to the Left the Democratic Party has become. It's not the Democratic Party even of Barack Obama and they're going to have a hard time selling this to America, especially the part of America that lives somewhere between the two coasts. So good luck with that Democrats, you have just taken a sharp Left turn right off the California coast, swimming in the Pacific. Hope that works out well for you. HANNITY: You know, Karl Rove, I see one big influence on the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, they've all adopted some version of the New Green Deal, which we know means no oil, gas, no combustion engine, everything's free, eventually we get rid of cars, planes and cows. I don't know if that's going to sell. Maybe I don't know that much about politics, though. KARL ROVE, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I don't think it sells. And I think neither do Democrats, which is why when the Senator McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, brought up the bill up in the House - the Senate floor. Chuck Schumer attacked him for doing so, calling it a stunt. They don't want to be forced to vote for it. But isn't that amazing, we have these four young freshman members who are exerting an enormous influence over the Democratic Party. And as I said in my column in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today in reference to AOC, they're unusually shallow. I mean, that Green New Deal draft that she produced which talked about cow flatulence and unspecified actions that were going to curb people's ability to go get on an airplane and travel on their vacation and all kinds of sort of Left-Wing Nostrum that would turn us into new Venezuela. Not too many Democrats stood up and said, you know what, that's really nutty Democrats. Democrats stood up and say, \"Well, I think it goes in the right direction. Same on immigration, it is this four that have taken very firm stances in favor of open borders. I wrote my column today about Ocasio-Cortez coming out last week for the abolition, not only of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but the entire Department of Homeland Security. And where are the Greybeards inside the Democratic Party who say, \"No, that's too extreme. We're going to reform the agency\". No, no, they're keeping their mouth shut, because they don't want to be on the other side of the so-called justice Democrats that \"The Squad\" represents the sort of Left-Wing fringe of the Democratic Party. HANNITY: You can add free health care for illegals and then we can have during birth and after birth and fantasize by way more Democrats than I ever thought possible in my lifetime and then we can add to it everybody seems afraid of them Governor. HUCKABEE: People aren't that stupid. I mean you've got to be really stupid in order to believe that somehow everybody's going to get free education. That open borders are going to make America a safer and a better place and less expensive to live in, and that somehow we can take vacations to Hawaii by swimming there rather than taking an airplane. I mean, there's just a point at which they're stretching everybody's capability of suspending their belief to a point where they could buy into the Democratic platform. And then they've taken it to a new level, Sean. The anti-Semitism, the hate for Israel, the disgust for America, I think that's simply the most dangerous thing of all, the other stuff is silly. But this is serious stuff. When you show that level of anti-Semitism that these four have shown and you show no capacity to appreciate what America has done. America is not a perfect place. I'll be the first to admit. There's a lot of things we ought to fix. But by golly, I've grown up in this country, have come a long way from what I've seen when I was a kid to what I see now, experience a lot of the blessings of this country. And I don't think these four represent the optimism, the hope and the resilience of the America that many of us have lived in. HANNITY: Let me ask Karl Rove this last question. Let's look at the people of North Carolina last night, Karl. Were they reacting to virulent anti- Semitism and the idea that you laugh at the way Americans talk about Al Qaeda after 9/11? Or well wanting leniency for nine people that wanted to join ISIS and all the other anti-Semitic remarks? Do you think maybe they hear that and they're disgusted, because that's what I sensed? ROVE: Well, I think that's part of it. I think, though, it's the whole package. They look at them and sort of are bewildered that that people are in the United States Congress could be so far Left and so antagonistic to our free enterprise democratic system. And in there is a lesson, if the if simply the President, but our Senate candidates and House candidates on the Republican side do three things. They pick out these issues that the particularly the Left Wing of the Democratic Party is forcing on the entire party, and they say this is bad policy and explain why. And then say here's why it's not in keeping with our values. And finally the most difficult things say, we on the center-right of American politics. That conservatives have a better idea. If we do those things systematically, we'll be in good shape. The President did it in that speech. I thought we saw it in the State of the Union address when he sort of foreshadowed this. America is not a socialist country. He had a pretty deliberate, pretty focused, indictment of those - of \"The Squad\" as they call themselves. I think if the President continues to do that, and focuses on the issue - less on the personality, more on the issue and does those three things. Here's why it's bad policy for America, here's why it's not even keeping with our values and we've got a better idea for the future - of the country we'll be in a better place in 2020. HANNITY: They had a hell of a track record. The best employment in situation since 1969 and for every demographic group, thank God. Thank you both. All right, when we come back, buckle up he is fired up over all of this, \"The Great One\" Mark Levin. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right a new crop of radical extreme socialist Democrats led by, yes, \"The Squad\". That would be Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez's squad, are now sowing chaos in the Democratic Party and they have taken the battle of the President. But are they merely playing into Trump's hands. Here now this is eight weeks in a row. #1 for six. The author of \"The New York Times\" #1 bestseller \"Unfreedom of the Press\". I call him \"The Great One\". \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" #1 Sunday nights at Fox. He also syndicates a radio show that I made him do, but that's a back story that we'll tell you another day. \"Great One\" how am I? MARK LEVIN, \"LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN\" HOST: All right. Sean, I want to thank you for having me on tonight as I watch this idiocy that's taking place in our country. President Trump was addressing the content, of the character of these four women, not the color of their skin. But the media wanted to be otherwise. The media are projecting and the media are insisting on the opposite, because they want the narrative of racism. He didn't talk about race. He didn't talk about skin color he didn't talk about religion. He talked about them, the content or lack thereof of their character. On the other hand, Omar, Tlaib, AOC, I don't know this Pressley that well. They are degrading an entire faith, an entire people - Jew, Israelis, an entire country - Israel. So it shouldn't surprise anybody that their venom for America is same as their venom for Israel and vice versa, that's typical of the radical hard Left. And the evidence is overwhelming that these women are anti-Semite bigots and they don't hide it. They don't hide it. The BDS movement, their constant references to Hitler and the Third Reich and concentration camps, they have no knowledge of history. They've never visited these sites. Their families really have done nothing for this country. I'm going to be very blunt about it. I don't know what they've done in support of this country, while they rip this great country apart, while we have men and women in uniform of all faiths and all colors in one hellhole after another all over the world trying to defend people and promote freedom. We have this fifth column in our country, and they're not alone, the media's of fifth column too, undermining us at home, while our brave men and women are fighting abroad. So they hate the President because he has two strikes against him. He loves America and he's the greatest President that Israel has ever seen. Recognizing their capital in Jerusalem, moving our embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing sovereignty of Israel over the Golan Heights, kicking the PLO the hell out of our country, cutting off funds for terrorists that are linked to the Palestinian Authority, and it's driving these three anti- Semites nuts. That's what's going on. Now, 50% of the hate crimes in this country are against Jews. The media don't mention. You know Democrat Party, you have a high tolerance for anti- Semitism in your ranks, maybe you ought to tone it down maybe. You ought to tone it down Omar and Tlaib and AOC. But no, they're celebrated. They're promoted. Now let's look at Donald Trump's record when it comes to Muslims and women of color, particularly overseas. Let's take a look at Syria, where this Commander in Chief ordered attacks on Syria to prevent that regime from gassing women of color, men of color, babies of color, Muslims. It was this President who stepped in, not Obama. It's this President who ordered his military to destroy ISIS and the Caliphate that was killing women of color, men of color, babies of color, Muslims, Yazidis and Christians too, but primarily Muslims. It's this Commander in Chief that oversees the war in Afghanistan to protect Muslims from the Taliban. That would be men, women, children of color. Now what the hell of Omar and Tlaib and AOC done for men and women and children of color? Not a damn thing. Now let's talk about the southern border. It's this President who said look - and I didn't even agree with this, 1-1.2 million individuals who are here illegally, most of them south of the border, from south of the border, I'll give them legalization, maybe even citizenship if we can cut a deal on immigration. The Democrats said no. Does that sound like a racist to you? It's this President who was prescient and said secure the border, you have people coming into this country, some of them have been kidnapped little kids, brought into this country. We need to have a rational, humane process for immigration. It's the Democrats who first said, 10 years ago secure the border, then call this a joke, a manufactured crisis. Now they created the crisis. They created the lack of the detention space. They created the lack of physical barriers. And now they blame the President who tried to prevent it. The media have allowed this to happen. They are a disgrace. They have a high tolerance for racism and anti- Semitism. Why? Because they are the mouthpiece for the Hard Left. This President is not a racist. This president is a patriot. HANNITY: Wow. That's why I call you \"The Great One\". Mark Levin, powerful monologue. Thank you my friend. Don't forget Mark's show every Sunday night. You see his book there \"Unfreedom of the Press\". But here at Fox 10:00 Eastern Sunday nights. When we come back, what's going on in these liberal cities across the country, Trace Gallagher has a full report. We'll also see and hear from our special correspondent Lawrence Jones, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. We have a reporting on this show by liberal cities all across the country. Wow, the people that have the most compassion for other people, through all at a total crisis. Last night we were reported on the brutal MS-13 slayings in California. Tonight there are major eruptions again of violence in the City of Chicago. Fox News Chief Breaking News Correspondent Trace Gallagher again from our West Coast Newsroom. When are we going to solve this problem and save lives, our treasure, our family? This has gone on for how many years? TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR: And that's the $60,000 question, Sean. But even Chicago Mayor, Lori Lightfoot acknowledges that police are quote \"Losing the streets\". The Mayor made the comments while visiting New York. And despite Chicago being smaller, its homicide rate is higher than both New York and Los Angeles. Take a look at these numbers. Over the Memorial Day weekend 43 people were shot in Chicago, seven of them died, that's despite deploying an additional 1,200 police officers. Over the 4th of July holiday weekend, an additional 1,500 police were on the streets and yet 66 were shot, six died. And last weekend - ordinary weekend, 40 were shot, nine fatally. Mayor Lightfoot says, \"She's not ready to change police leadership. But that leadership needs to do better\". And here in Los Angeles were learning more about the horrific string of murders by MS-13. The indictment says the gang has recently seen an influx of young Central American migrants who rise in the ranks by committing murders and police say they have committed seven murders. It's notable, this comes at a time when California is fighting to support sanctuary cities and fighting against tougher immigration policies. HANNITY: All right. Trace Gallagher, thank you. Joining us now with reaction the Host of Fox Nation's \"Keeping up with Jones\". Is it Jones or Jones'? LAWRENCE JONES, CONTRIBUTOR: Jones. HANNITY: Jones. Lawrence Jones. JONES: Yes. Thank you, sir. HANNITY: There you go. I just bought Lawrence dinner - anyway, and our Special Correspondent. Also with us Fox News Contributor, radio talk shows nationally syndicated big troublemaker. I saw what you did to that media guy out in the Rose Garden. I kind of-- SEBASTIAN GORKA, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: He deserved it. HANNITY: You know what I wished you did, though, because that guy was out of line and said, \"I have bunch of demons\" or whatever he said. You're so big, I wanted you just hover over him, because he said, \"I'll take you on the back\". I love - like Jim Acosta says. \"I want to meet Hannity in the schoolyard\". I said, \"OK, I'm free the week of the 4th. But I'm not promoting your crappy book that only sold 8,000 copies in two weeks\". Levin as sold a half a million plus. Why didn't you stand over him? GORKA: Because the second I got in his face, Sean, the punk Brian Karem looked at his shoes like the little girl that he is. I made my point. HANNITY: I'm in the school yard, no, memories of traumatic past, fighting in the school yard. All right. You've been in liberal cities one after another. You know Rush made a point that I really agree with. We played it one night. He said, California, you don't have to fix things, because that's 55 guaranteed electoral votes. Why should they bother helping in San Francisco and LA? JONES: Well, I'll tell you this. Although, it's a guaranteed, there are people across this country that are getting very upset. When you talk about Chicago, my hometown Dallas, Texas, where murders after murders, they essentially have made the cops because of the unfair standard - of course you've got some bad apples in police departments. But a lot of the police officers are standing down because of the public pressure. These mayor's office are making this political, not given due process when it's deserved and the community is hurting. HANNITY: By the way, I'm going to call you out on something. JONES: Don't. Stop. HANNITY: No, I'm not going to do it now. Don't do it. I want you to tell your mom and dad what I'm - what I said to you tonight. All right, last word Dr. Gorka? GORKA: Think of the America we now live in, think of those cities, those municipalities that wish to make America great again. And then think of the sanctuary cities that have caused the deaths of Americans, because they've actually ignored detainer requests from ICE, from DHS. People have been released and killed again. And think about the fact, Sean, that this is the most disgusting of all. The Speaker of the House is giving advice to illegal aliens who have been giving a deportation notice-- HANNITY: Nancy Pelosi. GORKA: --how to evade the authorities-- HANNITY: Nancy Pelosi. GORKA: Nancy Pelosi is schooling - is schooling - yes, aiding and abetting illegal aliens who have a deportation notice. That is a crime. This is - choose. 2020 is choice between America and those who hate America, Sean. HANNITY: Good to see you both. All right. Your secret's safe. Just tell - you know that your secret is safe. More \u201cHannity\u201d right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Unfortunately, that is all the time we have left. Now, tomorrow night for the full hour, we are going to discuss this new extreme, radical, socialist Democratic Party, because 2020 is going to be the biggest choice election, tipping point election in the history of this country. So we are going to have a studio audience, that's tomorrow night, 9:00 Eastern right here on Fox. We will never be the destroy-Trump, rage, media mob. And not let your heart be troubled, there she is, Laura Ingraham. How are you? Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., late Thursday shared a video put together by Means TV, which describes itself as \u201can anti-capitalist on-demand digital streaming platform launching in late 2019.\u201d The group\u2019s website outlines how it plans to grow into being \u201can anti-capitalist media institution together,\u201d featuring \u201cyour favorite Leftist influencers, comedians, writers, organizers, and voices.\u201d TUCKER CARLSON: SOMEDAY, THE AOC MOMENT WILL PASS AND DEMS WILL REJOIN ADULT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IMMIGRATION Ocasio-Cortez plugged the video with her own commentary on the ills of the capitalist system. \u201cHow on earth could young people, whose wages are flat, costs of living skyrocketing, experiencing increased social instability via bigotry, addiction, + violence, expected to live shorter lifespans than previous gens dare question the larger economic forces in their lives?!\u201d she tweeted. The video itself featured comedian Sara June sarcastically explaining how capitalism works, and how to succeed in it. \u201cAnother beautiful day under capitalism, the greatest most functional economic system that has ever existed,\u201d the clip begins, before June spits out a sip from a cup of coffee. \u201cUnder capitalism, there are two ways to make money, and you definitely have to make money. If you\u2019re lucky, you own something like an apple farm, or a glue factory. That makes you the owning class.\u00a0If you don\u2019t own anything, you\u2019re part of the working class and you make money by selling your labor. You pretty much sell your labor until you retire. Sorry, let\u2019s take that again. You pretty much sell your labor until you die.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The clip wraps up with the line: \u201cIn conclusion, capitalism is a fun and efficient way to consolidate all the world's resources in the control of a tiny group of massively rich individuals at the expense of everyone else.\u201d",

Those of us who stuck it out, and actually live here, care about our future, and need representation.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez used her deceased father\u2019s Bronx condo on her voter registration since 2012, but has since denied reports that she doesn\u2019t live in the Manhattan borough. Meanwhile, Papazian \u2013 the daughter of Egyptian immigrants\u00a0who currently lives with her widowed mother \u2013 has accused the headline-making\u00a0freshman representative of never responding to concerned people in the district \u201cwho have serious questions about her unrealistic and unworkable policies,\u201d and claims\u00a0that she \u201chas a mostly unstaffed office in Queens, and when constituents call her office in DC to ask for help, they get phone recordings with full message boxes.\u201d WHAT CHINESE SPIES WANT FROM AMERICANS But for this Bronx Republican, it is\u00a0the incumbent\u2019s economic policies that are the driving force behind her own political aspirations. \u201cIt has been galling listening to Ocasio-Cortez push really hackneyed big government ideas that have failed around the world. These include her Green New Deal and Medicare for all,\u201d Papazian said. \u201cThis district is home to first and second-generation immigrants. It is a middle-class district, because our families came here, worked hard, bought houses, and flourished. Many of us come from families that escaped socialism. No one wants it here.\u201d And as\u00a0Papazian fears, some U.S. businesses also view the Ocasio-Cortez-led socialist economic plug as a possibility rather than\u00a0a delusional fantasy. Independent retailer Metals.com last month surveyed more than 100,000 of its members across the country to gather insights on the attitudes and behaviors of U.S. retirees aged 60 and over, with some 91.5 percent labeling the Democrat party \u201cas more socialist\u201d since the 2018 election. \u201cAs Democrats control the House, they are becoming openly bold about socialist programs \u2013 like Medicare for All, confiscatory tax rates for top earners and a Green New Deal, their hard-left turn is no longer a matter for discernment,\u201d said Metals Vice President Deric Scott. A\u00a0Gallup poll last year found that more Democrats \u2013 some 57 percent \u2013 now have a more \u201cpositive\u201d view of the word socialism than they did ten years ago amid the financial collapse. Papazian insists there is nothing optimistic about what her area\u2019s representative is promoting. \u201cOcasio-Cortez seems to have zero understanding of how our economy works to create the relative wealth and comfort people have made for themselves and their families. The Whitestone Bridge connects the East Bronx and Northwest Queens portions of the district. Her policies are literally a threat to our way of life,\u201d Papazian said. \u201cMontefiore Hospital is the biggest employer in the Bronx part, and her Medicare for All plans would bankrupt them. Tens of thousands of well-paid healthcare workers would be out of work.\u201d BERNIE SANDERS GRILLED ON SOCIALISM BY HARVARD STUDENT WHOSE FAMILY FLED SOVIET RUSSIA She also argued that Jet Blue and the airports are the biggest employers in the Queens part of the Ocasio-Cortez district and that her Green New Deal, \u201cwhich would get rid of air travel, would make tens of thousands of well-paid avionics workers jobless.\u201d Papazian said that she has\u00a0established an \u201cexploratory committee\u201d to begin crafting her running plans, and will file her official papers with the Federal Election Commission in the next few months. She also noted that the issues she intends to run on are centered on \u201cpro-growth tax policies for economic diversity, affordable private health insurance, border control as a national security issue, less government intrusion and regulation, strong defense and fewer wars\u201d and the local matter of fixing the \u201ccrumbling roads and subway system\u201d rather than bolstering the cost for vehicles heading into Manhattan as part of the Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo-backed push for a 2021 \u201ccongestion tax.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And while she is a rookie when it comes to an office run, Papazian is no newcomer when it comes to stymying political correctness and niceties. On her Facebook page, Papazian takes almost daily aim at Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 whom she refers to as the \u201cBronx Bolshevik\u201d \u2013 illuminating her policies with both dismay and derision, lambasting the young Democrat for everything from failing to respond to her constituency and adequately staff her office, to her \u201creality show\u201d struggles to set up IKEA furniture while the people in her district are left languishing amid real-life struggles, to suggesting she move\u00a0to the ravaged socialist nation of Venezuela. \u201cSeeing her in action, my shock turned to indignation at this takeover of an office that exists to meet our needs,\u201d Papazian added. A spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but her representatives have previously stated that they \u201cwelcome\u201d competition and Democratic values.",

According to Politico,\u00a0a video surfaced in 2014 of Cabrera\u00a0praising Uganda\u2019s restrictive anti-gay laws. In response, Cabrera, who is also a pastor, pointed out that he has voted in favor of every piece of legislation supported\u00a0by the LGBT caucus while on New York's city council. Cabrera was first elected to the city council in 2009, and he lives about a mile outside of the district which he is running to represent.

      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 who has already proven she knows almost nothing about her beloved socialism, the environment, energy, science, economics, job creation and government \u2013 has now shown she knows almost nothing about history. But hey, why let facts get in the way of a good tweet or soundbite for TV? Ocasio-Cortez certainly never has. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted Thursday on behalf of statehood for Washington, D.C. \u2013 a long-cherished goal of Democrats, because the city\u2019s overwhelming Democratic voter registration would guarantee that party two more seats in the Senate and one in the House. OCASIO-CORTEZ PROMOTES DC STATEHOOD, CLAIMS 'RIGHT TO VOTE IS DENIED' The District of Columbia Board of Elections reported in August that a whopping 76 percent of the city\u2019s registered voters are Democrats, but only 6 percent are Republicans. Never mind that 19 other U.S. cities have larger populations than Washington, D.C. Democrats don\u2019t argue for statehood for those cities. In tweeting on behalf of D.C. statehood, Ocasio-Cortez wrote: \u201cDC was the 1st territory in the United States to free the enslaved. It\u2019s where Black Americans fled the tyranny of slavery & towards greater freedom, to DC. Yet today it\u2019s where 2nd class citizenship reigns, and the right to vote is denied.\u201d Uh, not really, Madam Congresswoman. The National Archives \u2013 which employs real historians as opposed to politicians who just make stuff up \u2013 says that: \u201cSlavery remained legal in the District until April 16, 1862, when President Abraham Lincoln signed into law an act abolishing slavery in the District.\u201d This took place when the Civil War (perhaps you\u2019ve heard of it, Congresswoman?) was well underway. In fact, Vermont abolished slavery in 1777. By 1804\u00a0every Northern state had passed laws to abolish slavery. It took a few years for abolition to phase in in some states. When confronted with these historical facts, Ocasio-Cortez tried to explain away her obviously false tweet, writing on Twitter: \u201cThe right is pushing back on this. To clarify in 280 chars, DC was the first area where enslaved people were freed by the US government.\u201d OK, but that\u2019s not a clarification. It\u2019s a correction of a blatantly false statement \u2013 something Ocasio-Cortez could not bring herself to admit. Ocasio-Cortez also stated falsely in her tweet that \u201cthe right to vote is denied\u201d to residents of the nation\u2019s capital. In fact, the people of Washington elect their own City Council members and mayor. And since 1961 D.C. residents have been allowed to vote for candidates for president and vice president, and the district has been able to cast ballots in the Electoral College. It\u2019s true, however, that because Washington, D.C., isn\u2019t a state, it doesn\u2019t have voting representation in Congress, although it does have a non-voting representative in the House. But that\u2019s a far cry from claiming D.C. residents are \u201c2nd class\u201d citizens who don\u2019t have the right to vote. Why are Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s ignorance and false statements about slavery and the lack of voting rights for residents of Washington important? Because they illustrate her cluelessness and dishonesty (if she actually believes the nonsense she is peddling) about a lot of other things. And because she has become a magnet for media coverage and has a huge social media following, the 29-year-old first-term congresswoman \u2013 who worked as a waitress and bartender before her surprise election victory last year \u2013 has enormous influence on the left. Some of her enthusiastic supporters even want her to run for president after she turns 35, the minimum age for a president set in the Constitution. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER It would take a book to list all the false \u2013 and frankly ridiculous \u2013 statements Ocasio-Cortez has made in her meteoric rise to media stardom. For example, she has come up with the Green New Deal to fight climate change and restructure our entire society to bring about a socialist revolution. In reality, the Green New Deal requires actions that are scientifically impossible, enormous tax increases on us all, the destruction of many industries and millions of American jobs, and trillions of dollars in new government spending that would bankrupt our country. And on top of it all, the Green New Deal wouldn\u2019t even affect climate change, because it would do\u00a0nothing to reduce carbon emissions in other countries. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In addition, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s embrace of the failed system of socialism is downright scary. If she seriously thinks Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea, China and the old Soviet Union are role models for what the U.S. should be, she needs to go back to elementary school and catch up on lessons she missed. The congresswoman could have a great career as a writer of fantasy and science fiction. What comes out of her mouth \u2013 and her Twitter feed \u2013 is so divorced from reality that no one who has made it past kindergarten should take it seriously.

GREG GUTFELD, HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and she nearly drowned in a dew drop, Dana Perino. \u201cThe Five.\u201d The Trump re-election campaign kicks off tonight in Orlando. That's in Florida. DANA PERINO, HOST: Thank you. GUTFELD: You know what to expect (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I gladly stand up next to you. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I thought that was the sun in my eyes. It's these stupid lights. What are they doing? That runway is like an ice skating rink. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: And the first step I said, you know, this sucker is slippery. This is the worst damn stage I've ever seen. Cow cash cow shoe. But I like I-10 much better. Can we go by I-10? Do you mind? Last night I watched Alfred E. Newman. Beto. Beto is falling fast. What the hell happened? I was made for this. He was made for it. He was made to fall like a rock. And I don't know what the hell happened to Biden. And Bernie, you know Bernie is crazy. Bernie is crazy. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Now compare all of that to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: My name is Joe Biden, and I'm running for this case, running for President in the United States. Look me over. If you like what you see (INAUDIBLE) not vote for the other person. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am really enjoying this process of running for President of the United States. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will always be real with you. I will be bold without the bold. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Yikes. It's a roller coaster versus the little pony carousel. Santa elves versus the big orange rhino. It's a fact, at Trump rally is really fun unlike those socialist infomercials that induce vomiting. That's because Trump's a phenomenon that combines the powers of persuasion, pro-wrestling, reality TV, and celebrity roast into one giant fireball. It's a historical and hysterical first. But it's also early. So who knows who can match Trump for thrills and chills? But how can the Dems have 20 candidates but not a single clue? They're meeting the Donald with the dull. Here's what to consider watching tonight's rally. Would any of the energy and humor make any sense if America wasn't doing great? Would any of Trump's words feel bizarrely off if we were in deep trouble? Of course, but they won't because we're not. If there were big wars, unemployment, high crime, a dead economy, there'd be no place for this at all. Sure, if you're obsessively furious at Trump you'll say it's the worst of times. But measure his performance using practical evidence and not his tweets or his behavior, it might be the best. So the rally will be fun and loud and unpredictable because the mitigation of other bigger problems make it so. In fact, all the stuff from impeachment blather to media meltdowns are products of an age when big problems are being tackled in new ways. Of course, millions will love the rally. Millions will hate it. And millions won't care. But their ability to happily decide is brought to you by one sturdy fact. America is better off now than it's been in years. All right. So, Juan, maybe I pose this question to you, energy isn't what America wants after four years. Maybe they want a comfy sweater. Maybe the Democrats are right to come at this and maybe a more muted way. JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: I think that's right. I think that this is a referendum on Donald Trump. Donald Trump loses. Because if you look at the polls, he's under water. He's strongly under water. So he's got -- you know, Democrats have to say here's someone who's stable, someone who is rational, who doesn't tweet off crazy stuff, someone that you can trust in critical moments. And I think that's why Joe Biden right now has the lead. And I think last night I read he said he had 20 million bucks in the bank. So he's really raised more money than any other Democrat. So that -- those are all the reasons. I think the only strategy left for Trump, and I think we'll see it tonight at the rally, Greg, is for him to attack and smear his opponent. So he'll talk about the socialist. He's going to talk about nasty women. He's going to talk about tired, Sleepy Joe. That's what he has to do because if it's just about Donald Trump, he loses. So he's got to, you know, nasty up his opponent to the point where people would say, you know what? I'll go with Trump. By the way, in response to your things, you always say things are so great. If things are so great, Greg, why did Democrats capture 40 seats in the midterms? Why are we sending troops to the Middle East? Why do you think that it's farmers are complaining about the lack of a trade deal and the tariffs are driving up prices at Walmart and Costco? I mean, there's a reason people are saying this guy is not a good president. GUTFELD: Those are -- when you compare to the overall world view, Jesse, low unemployment, booming economy, a shrinking military footprint while having a huge military, he doesn't necessarily have to insult anybody. He can just go by his record. JESSE WATTERS, HOST: I can't believe a president is going to attack his political opponent, Juan. How dare them? That's never happened before. WILLIAMS: Never heard of it. WATTERS: And you know, I can't believe, you know, a Republican president might lose seats in a midterm. That's never happened before either. Didn't yesterday I showed you every single person that won the presidency since 1984 had been down in the polls in June and they came back and won? WILLIAMS: Yeah, but they didn't fire their pollster? WATTERS: OK, Juan, listen -- GUTFELD: For leaking. WATTERS: -- they're going to fire you if you keep on disrespecting the audience. Listen, the polls right now mean nothing. The polls said Hillary was going to beat Trump. Polls said Hillary was going to beat Trump in Florida, OK? And he won by 100,000 votes in Florida after being outspent 53 to 1 down the stretch. He's got, in Florida, two Republican senators. He's got a Republican governor. And the Quinnipiac poll actually said both of those guys, Desantis and Scott were going to lose by seven in the midterms and they won. So, the fact that that polls show from Quinnipiac, Biden beating Trump by 7, in Florida, doesn't really mean much right now. The media knows there's no one that can compete against Donald Trump at these rallies. They see a line. They see people in tents camping out. They see the raucous connection he makes, and the crowd goes wild. And they'll do anything they can to denigrate him because they know a Democrat can't pull it off, so they'll go after his supporters. You'll see tonight reporters on the ground. They won't interview Hispanic or black Trump supporters. They'll look for the craziest people with the most radical signs and they'll actually debate them. But the ironic thing is the more they attack the president and his supporters, the stronger that connection gets. GUTFELD: Dana, you know, the only way Dems can get people showing up in tents is by making them homeless. We'll be right back. No, what do you expect tonight out of Trump? I know what you're going to say, but I want you to say it. PERINO: No, please, why don't you just speak for me? GUTFELD: I don't think -- I don't think he should ramble. PERINO: I wasn't going to say that, but I agree. GUTFELD: Oh, thank you. PERINO: But, no, actually people love the rambling. What are you talking about? GUTFELD: I think going long. I don't think so he should go long. PERINO: OK. Well, I'll let you give him that advice. But like, you just showed that montage which is hilarious because he was rambling -- GUTFELD: Yeah. PERINO: -- about things that are not in the script when he's talking about the lights and -- GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah, yeah. PERINO: -- the floor and everything. I think this, you can't capture lightning in a bottle twice. And if I were them, I would down play all comparisons to 2015, because now he has a record to defend, and as you say, you know, the record is all these amazing great things. So he can talk about those things. Before, he was the insurgent. He was the I am going to come in there, I'm going to shake things up, I'm going to be the outsider, and he has done all of those things. But now he also is an incumbent, and incumbency gives you so many tools to use. It is so hard to beat an incumbent president. Very, very difficult. If you think it only happened twice since World War II. So I think the polling right now it doesn't really matter. It matters for Biden because he can figure out a way like raise more money. But for the polls right now that doesn't really matter. You're going to see a lot more after the debates. I would say that his biggest strength right now, the war chest is huge, it's got all of this money, didn't have it the first time, the RNC firmly behind him from the jump. He's got a huge amount of organization, so they've got all these get-out the vote pieces, the numbers of people that they can talk to. People getting their cell phones with their pictures on it so that they could send it to their friends. All that stuff they didn't have a way to capture it before and they do now. That said, it's still going to be a big race. And there's all of these states that they're going to have to pay a lot of attention to. GUTFELD: Emily, bring us home with the most thoughtful analysis on this network today. EMILY COMPAGNO, HOST: Glad to. What is so telling and also should be so encouraging to the Trump team right now is, you know, people were waiting in line for 40 hours for this. And the closest we've ever seen to something like that was the Obama nomination in 2008, right, at the Denver Bronco's stadium. And obviously, that was media reported 75,000. Amway only holds 20,000. And obviously, this is a very different event. But the point to note is that Obama failed to generate that kind of enthusiasm in 2012 the next time around. And here we have the incumbent with people standing in line for 40 hours for this announcement. PERINO: Yeah, it's true. GUTFELD: Well, that was good. PERINO: That was the best analysis all day. GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. By the way, just one point, Orlando Sentinel already, ahead of the rally, issued a non-endorsement without knowing the other candidate. Isn't that kind of garbage on the part of a paper? WILLIAMS: Doesn't that tell you something about Trump? GUTFELD: No, it's an emotional response, though. That's an emotional response of a paper. That's why nobody likes these papers is that that's so -- it's such a delusional like, oh, we don't like him. We don't care who's running against him. That's the paper. WILLIAMS: If they think -- if they say that they as thoughtful people -- this is an editorial -- this is an unsigned editorial by the whole newspaper -- GUTFELD: Yeah, a bunch of babies. WILLIAMS: And they're saying, listen, the state of the country, the defensiveness, the anger -- GUTFELD: But those are all emotional issues not practical evidence. Orlando Sentinel, stick to the facts. Anyway, all right, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez outrageous comments comparing our southern border to concentration camps. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez facing criticism after she made this comparison. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: The United States is running concentration camps on our southern border. And that is exactly what they are. They're concentration camps. The fact that concentration camps are now in institutionalized practice in the home of the free is extraordinarily disturbing. And we need to do something about it. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: After Representative Liz Cheney criticized those remarks, Ocasio-Cortez doubled down tweeting, quote, hey, Representative Cheney, since you're so eager to educate me, I'm curious, what do you call building mass camps of people being detained without a trial? How would you dress up DHS's mass separation of thousands of children at the border from their parents? Dana, I just think it was a poor choice, a poor framing by Ocasio-Cortez that allowed -- and she said the shrieking Republicans to blow back at her. But, do you think that she has a point? PERINO: I think she love the blow back. It's like her fuel, right? So it -- she doesn't care what she says. I mean, that was a false and alarming - - it was alarming and false equivalence of the unparalleled evils of what happened in the holocaust. She says never again in her -- in the original comments. And then later, she tries -- well, no, that's actually not what I meant. That can work for some people. And some people will defend you when you do that. But there's no -- there's like three Democrats who are defending her. So I think that's when you know that you are out there on a limb, and then you're like Bugs Bunny sawing off the end. I think that Pelosi, as a speaker, has a choice to make. Remember, they've had this several times. Are they going to try to get these younger members in check? I don't think so. I mean, because AOC's -- she's her own phenomenon. And I don't think she minds at all the controversy. She just let's it roll right off her back. She doesn't mind what she's saying is a false equivalence. She doesn't care. It actually fuels her. WILLIAMS: All right. So let me go to the magazine editor because, Greg, she says she's really referring to an Esquire article in which the political editor said a concentration camp is not a death camp, not Auschwitz or Dachau, but, you know, where you, as she said in the tweet there, where you simply separate and concentrate a group of people. GUTFELD: I mean, she's basically playing with words. And how great is it that she's referring to Esquire Magazine for her expertise on what a concentration camp is. That's called the media loop. That's right. So she refers to Esquire and then Esquire refers back to her, and they just sit there, it's just a self-reverential massage. Who's -- here's a question. Who is a biggest expert on anti-Semitism, AOC or Israel? Because right now she's criticizing Trump, right? Basically, that's what she's doing. Israel just named a town after Trump, right? WILLIAMS: Yes. GUTFELD: I mean, it's not Cortez Heights. It's Trump Heights. Case closed. I mean, what she did -- this is a measure of character. Look, she throws -- she's a bomb thrower. Trump is a bomb thrower. She's got a talent. But the fact is, the talent has to be how to do it correctly. And she's got to own up to her mistakes. She made a mistake. Unless she thinks like concentration and concentration camp means thinking really hard, it doesn't mean that. And by the way, buried in all of this is she has no solution for these temporary encampments. Which, by the way, Obama had as well and used the same place, which is -- if you don't have a place to put these people then they just come right in. So you're basically saying you're for no borders, if you're against -- just these -- the temporary holding. And it's so mean to the people who work with these -- work with the people, the agents. I mean, are they concentration camp guards? Is that what you're inferring? I'd like to see her apologize. She should person up. WILLIAMS: All right. So, Emily, the president tweeted overnight in advance of today's rally that there's going to be a mass deportation effort led by a large number of agents in the next week. Apparently, ICE was surprised by. We know that Kirstjen Nielsen and Ron Vitiello, with the former ICE director, both were reluctant to do this. That's why they were forced out. But how does that this fit in to what Ocasio-Cortez is talking about? Because it does instill fear in the immigrant community. COMPAGNO: I don't know how it fits in other than she is failing at her job, which is if she has an issue with a policy that she inherited as a lawmaker then get off livestream and start drafting a bill. Then change that policy because my tax dollars are paying your salary and you should earn that dollar. The policy of ICE after final order of deportation is such that within 90 days they institute removal proceedings. And, unless the subject voluntarily, basically, leaves on their own, they actually have no duty to do so. It is ICE's duty to come within 90 days and institute those removals. And you basically get a letter in the mail and it says meet here at this time, and it's kind of like a self-surrender. So if she has an issue with that too, then why don't you change it? Why don't you garner some type of collective cogent agreement on the hill rather than loving your livestreaming and not knowing what you're talking about and making inflammatory false equivalency that are horrendously offensive? WILLIAMS: By the way, Jesse, you know, Emily makes a really good point. I think I saw in the polls it's 70-plus percent of Americans think the dreamers should be allowed to stay. Sixty percent say the way that we can deal with the border is to just have more border agents, more judges, what do you think? WATTERS: Well, I think 100 percent of Americans don't agree with AOC that we're running concentration camps. WILLIAMS: Well, I hope not. WATTERS: And she's becoming more extreme because she's running out of steam. You never want to compare anything to the holocausts. It diminishes the genocides. It makes you look stupid. She's only doing this because she doesn't have a real solution. Only thing she's offered, she wants to abolish ICE, she says global warming is pushing the migrants north, and she says we're running concentration camps. She a member of Congress, we forget sometimes because she sounds like a bomb thrower on cable. She can do something. She hasn't sponsored one piece of legislation at all. And now she's backpedaling and trying to distinguish between it's a concentration camp versus a death camp. She's really losing this issue. She's dragged her party so far to the left on impeachment, on global warming and on the border. Some of these positions nationally that she's taken to are unelectable. And she's been sparring with Pelosi. Her best friend has been accused of anti-Semitism. Yes, on the whole, maybe she offers a lot of youth enthusiasm, fund raising, fresh glamour, perhaps, but on balance, I don't think she's been beneficial to the Democrat party. COMPAGNO: Greg, to your point, the vice president of the National Border Patrol Council invited her personally, Art Del Cueto, says please come down, I will tour you around these facilities. I think she should take him up on that, and then she should livestream it. Let's hear her thoughts, you know, at that same time -- PERINO: Absolutely. COMPAGNO: Exactly \u2013 WATTERS: She won't go. COMPAGNO: Exactly. WATTERS: She won't go. WILLIAMS: All right. Well, I think a lot of the people have trouble on the Democratic side with the way people are treated at the border. Fox News contributor Lawrence Jones getting harassed at an impeach-Trump rally. The video, so sad, next on \u201cThe Five.\u201d (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: All right. Just new examples of double standards coming from the left. First, Fox News contributor Lawrence Jones was at an impeach-Trump rally here in New York over the weekend when he was taunted by liberal protesters hurling racist comments at him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obviously, the people before us. (INAUDIBLE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go back to Kenya now. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Lawrence, expanding on the harassment on Hannity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LAWRENCE JONES, CONTRIBUTOR: These guys come up to me and they say, you know, go back to Fox News to pick cotton. They say go back to Kenya. This is who these people are. They know that with our report and exposing the poverty and the failure of policies that all these Democrat cities have been doing to many people that look like me, they don't want this to be exposed. They've believe that all black people need to think it the same way. They want us to stay on the welfare system so we can't progress in life. And I'm going to expose it every single day. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Next, we have Parkland shooting survivor and second amendment advocate, Kyle Kashuv, he had his Harvard acceptance rescinded over racial remarks he posted on social media and texted to his friends when he was just 16. Some are comparing to this to Virginia's Democratic governor Ralph Northam's yearbook photo. Remember he was the one in black face standing next to someone in the KKK attire, he's still governor. And then, you have liberal actor John Cusack who shared an anti-Semitic cartoon on twitter. The cartoon showing a giant hand with a Star of David pushing down a group of people with the words to learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize. Cusack added his own sentiment writing, quote, follow the money. Cusack eventually deleting the tweet and blaming it on a bot. I don't know, Dana. Where do you want to begin there? PERINO: Well, maybe just make a general comment that for a long time conservatives operated sort of individually. They would maybe have a small group of friends and they hung out together and they, you know, were subscribers to the National Review and then fast forward. There's the Reagan revolution, OK? You can see a little bit more. There's television. You've got Fox News. Social media, however, has been the great equalizer, I believe, for conservatives. So, you now have exposure of this kind of thing and an ability to talk about it and it gets out there and it makes -- I think it makes people pretty uncomfortable -- that's unfair, that's unfair. But there can't be two sets of rules for people that are conservatives or liberal. Like we're all put on this planet. Life is hard. We should all treat each other really well. But when conservatives do something that is considered out of bounds, they just get pummeled. The left kind of runs the culture and they protect one another from any sort of criticism. WATTERS: Yeah. And people wonder, you know, do Republicans or conservatives protect each other, sometimes they do. Sometimes they don't. Juan, what did you think about Lawrence Jones down there, downtown in Manhattan getting roughed up like that? WILLIAMS: Well, I know what it's like to be black on Fox News. I mean, there're lots of people who are highly critical. They say, you know, hey, you legitimize Fox, or you're covering up, you know, for some of the things that they object to hearing from Fox News. But I think racism on all sides has to be called out. And that kind of attitude towards Lawrence is just - - it's not acceptable. That to me, it is so damning that they feel the need to go to that extent. You know, so they're mad at Fox News. They're mad at Lawrence, maybe for working here. I think if you go to the root of what they're talking about is similar to what the candidates who refuse to appear on Fox News say, which is that, you know, if you appear on Fox News again, you give some legitimacy to Fox News. This is madness. Because, in fact, to my mind, at least I'm talking to people, I'm expressing my views. I think Lawrence is expressing his views. Now, Lawrence and I don't agree on everything. But Lawrence has a legitimate right to speak his truth, why don't you want to hear? So to me that's intolerance coming from the Left. I can't agree with you on the young man from Harvard, by the way. I just think to me, I mean in the Ralph Northam situation, as Dana says, we got to be equal. I think Democrats - the two Democratic Senators in the state called for him to resign. I think lots of people have been highly critical. But he was elected Governor, and under the law of our country, he gets to stay if he doesn't resign. WATTERS: Yes. Well, that wasn't my personal opinion. I'm just saying some people are bringing those two issues together to make a point about double standards. Emily? COMPAGNO: I agree with you. I think it's an example of the intolerance on the Left. And also an example that - the Left likes to tell women or people of color or some type of marginalized or underrepresented group, when to be outraged and how to feel. And it feels horrible to be told that and to be pushed into a box and for them to assume that they know better than you, because that's the greatest form of those bonds that they tell everyone else to kind of free themselves with from. And you mentioned earlier, I think it's a larger picture. They're not just representing a network, but because they're mad at Trump, they're not mad at this. They're mad at him. They blame everything for it. That footage made me sick to my stomach and I feel so horrible for Lawrence in that moment. And remember, we talked about after the terrible shooting at the country music festival when Jason Aldean is performing, and I had a close friend say to my face, \"I'm glad it happened at a Country Music Festival, because now maybe they'll be gun laws\". Like it should have happened to you people. It's horrible and unacceptable at any level of the spectrum. WATTERS: Yes. Well, Lawrence handled it the right way. He didn't really take the bait and he got it all on camera and exposed the guy. Greg? GUTFELD: Just to the John Cusack, Kyle Kashuv-- WATTERS: Kashuv. GUTFELD: Kashuv. I say you have to accept all apologies, especially quick ones and honest ones. I've even accepted dubious apologies. I defended Joy Reid, even though she blamed her homophobic remarks on being hacked and we knew she was lying. But I accepted her apology, I defended Joy Behar, when she had gotten in trouble, I think, over anti-Christian remarks. I can't remember. But I - and I do that and I accept their apologies knowing they will never return that favor to us. The Kyle thing is also different in that. It was a kind of a private thing that he has disowned when he was 16. And I do think that as awful as the things were - that were said, you should accept the apology, especially Harvard. I mean, if Harvard gets found guilty of discrimination against Asian- Americans should you cancel the whole institution? Should it closed down because they were they were racist against Asians? If our civil civilization eliminates forgiveness or reject apologies and you're in favor of just canceling people, you're going to see more violence and more suicide. Because if you can't let people have a second chance in life, they're going to kill themselves and we've seen that already. I think the racism is ignored on the Left, because it's the media's team, so they carve out exceptions for people, they carve out exceptions for racism, they carve out exceptions for sexism. I mean, Weinstein got away with everything until like he couldn't get away with it. Homophobia, obviously, with Joy Reid. Violence against women, I mean Teddy Kennedy made it a long way after Chappaquiddick. So there's always been a double standard. There always will be a double standard because they own the ball, they own the playing field. WATTERS: All right. Good discussion. All right. Things going from bad to worse in Dominican Republic as more American tourists get sick and the 9th person passes away. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO,: The mystery into the death of several Americans in the Dominican Republic deepening after new reports surface of more U.S. tourists getting violently ill and a 9th American dies while visiting the country. Joining us now with the very latest is Fox News Correspondent Bryan LLenas. Bryan. BRYAN LLENAS, CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Dana. Well Joseph Allen (ph) was vacationing in the Dominican Republic when last Wednesday night he told his friends he was going back to his hotel room, because he felt like he had a fever. The next day the 55-year-old was found dead in his hotel room. This happened in the Terra Linda Resort in Sosua. Joseph's brother Jason says, Joseph just had a physical. He was in \"Very good shape\" and he had no issues. They now want his body checked by a forensic pathologist here in the U.S. There have been nine mysterious deaths on the island over the last year. The Dominican Republic listed the cause of death, for most of these cases, as heart attacks or pulmonary edema - lungs filling up with fluid. But the families say their loved ones were healthy before vacationing. We know at least three had alcohol from minibars. We don't know if the other six did. Meanwhile Will Cox, whose mother Leyla Cox died suddenly in Punta Cana says he is waiting for the Dominican Attorney General to give final approval to get a sample of his mother's blood sent to the U.S. for toxicology tests. We are learning 54 members, by the way, of a Jimmy Buffett fan club also got sick while traveling to Punta Cana in April. The members swam or had a drink in the same resort swim-up bar pool. And earlier this month, at least five high school seniors on a trip from Oklahoma, became ill after eating at a Japanese restaurant at the Hard Rock Hotel in Punta Cana where two Americans died. The State Department, Dana, has not issued a new travel warning for the Dominican Republic. I'm told they are awaiting FBI toxicology results for three of the victims expected in about three weeks, Dana. PERINO: All right. Bryan, thank you. Last night one of those Jimmy Buffett fans was on \"The Story\" where he detailed his experience. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANA FLOWERS, FELL SICK IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: I just began to get sick one evening while we were there and went to my room began vomiting, he had severe diarrhea, and just basically felt terrible. And went to bed and stayed in my room for two days before coming out again. That does seem to be the common denominator that we are all swimming in that one pool or that we all has something from that pool bar. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: All right. Greg, the State Department not really issuing a increased travel alert. There's four levels, they are level two. They could at least go to level three. They've got to wait three weeks for another toxicology report. GUTFELD: This calls for like a Tropical Quincy. Do you know what I mean? PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: If they saw that TV show - anyway. I think you have a greater risk of death in your own city, and I think what's happening right now, is you're seeing a bunch of different variables that are being grouped together and this happens when you have a lot of people traveling. It's considered the time of the year, so you're having more people there. It is possible that the alcohol was purchased that was tainted or cheap and not up to standards and that could have been a problem. But you got to be careful of the panic contagion which happens when one child gets sick then all the other kids get sick in class. The power of suggestion is a power. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: People can get - you know they you can think yourself sick. But I do think that there's something going on here. I just don't know if it's one thing. I don't know if it's one thing. PERINO: Yes, and I guess, that's probably why the government has not done anything more at this point. GUTFELD: Go to duty free BYOB, buy your drinks, buy your - and you bottles and your mixers and make sure everything - all the seals are on everything. WATTERS: Well, I called for a full travel boycott just to - look, a week ago and-- GUTFELD: they seven. WATTERS: --my warnings have not been heeded. I found out today that someone perished at Hotel Excellence the very place I stayed in-- GUTFELD: Really. WATTERS: --so this really is hitting home to me personally. My theory, you missed it Greg last week, was this. This is Caribbean sabotage. So another island is competing for tourism dollars, GUTFELD: No. WATTERS: Perhaps it's Puerto Rico. I'm not going to name names. GUTFELD: So just said names. WATTERS: We got saboteur. It has infiltrated some of these hotels in order to swing the tourism dollars back to their Island. It's just a theory. Also they share a border with Haiti. To say the least, that's not a very great place right now. Also, another theory-- GUTFELD: So anybody else you want to smear. WATTERS: The autopsy reports sound rigged to me - and are there other? Well, I mean they're all dying from the same reason while none of them have any history there. It's very suspicious. And it looks like the Haitian - I mean, looks like the Dominican Republic government is in on this, because they're involved in the cover-up. PERINO: All right. WATTERS: And the - no other nationality has been affected, but it seems like all Americans are being-- GUTFELD: Are you auditioning for Infowars? COMPAGNO: You are like Alessia Silvestri (ph)-- WATTERS: There are theories that are abounding about this drama, Greg, and I'm just sharing them as a concern. PERINO: Let me get a quick word from you Emily and Juan. COMPAGNO: I think PR would - it would behoove the tourism. The Dominican Republic I think should say something else besides it's an overreaction and Quincy and all. I think it would behoove them to say, \"Hey, you guys we're going to work on this and get back to you and at least would kind of convey a command of things\". I do think our State Department should have something besides an increased caution for those three weeks. Like, \"Hey, pause it for a while\". I can't even begin to respond all-- PERINO: Juan hasn't had a chance. WATTERS: But you had a great idea the other day from the PR perspective. PERINO: I did. WATTERS: What do they do with the mini bar? PERINO: Take all the mini bars out, destroy them and start over. WATTERS: Pour it all out. PERINO: All right, Juan. WILLIAMS: But Quincy, why not Ironside? GUTFELD: Quincy was great. WILLIAMS: Come on. But, I mean, you think the audience knows that. Come on. I'm just saying, I happen to agree with you, though. I think that this could be a matter of anecdotes and that that does not constitute a pattern. GUTFELD: Right. WILLIAMS: And when you look at the actual numbers, the numbers tell you this. In 2017 through 2018, that's 2 years have been 30 Americans who died in the Dominican Republic. I don't think that's one thousandth of a percent. So something maybe-- PERINO: But how many have died in other places? What's the equivalent? Like, I mean-- WILLIAMS: No, just as Greg said, if you were in the United States you have a better chance of a violent crime happening to you. But my point is that, we are all right now in a in a place because we're focused on this. Then all of a sudden everybody says I had a sickness way back when in that place. Maybe it's the - it can get out of hand-- PERINO: Jesse is having a phantom sickness. WILLIAMS: People should not stop travelling. PERINO: --from last December when you went to the Excellence. All right. Up next is the shocking new device that helps you quit bad habits. But would the THE FIVE would ever use it? That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COMPAGNO: If you're struggling to break a bad habit, this one's for you. There's no a bracelet that will give you a 350 volt shock when you get the urge to do something bad. So what would THE FIVE even think about trying something like this? Greg would you? GUTFELD: Well, first of all, don't buy anything health-related for your body without any independent research. The guy who made this was thrown off shark tank, because he didn't have any published research. Aversion therapy only works if it is truly aversive, meaning painful and out of your control. If it doesn't have that then it's pointless. PERINO: Like ANTABUSE. GUTFELD: Yes ANTABUSE. PERINO: Right. Which is like that medicine if you're an alcoholic and you want-- GUTFELD: I wouldn't know Dana. PERINO: I read studies about it. WATTERS: What you're getting at? I'm rocking this thing right now, should I try it out. COMPAGNO: What? WATTERS: All right. GUTFELD: Well, what you like - will you like chocolate. WATTERS: I love chocolate. I have the wrist thing on and I'm going to go for a piece and-- PERINO: Really? WATTERS: Yes. It hits you a little bit. No, I don't want to do it again. I like it. PERINO: Only one time and-- WATTERS: No, don't do it again, don't do it again. GUTFELD: Do it, do it. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: OK. How about this? I'm going to eat some chocolate-- WATTERS: I've taken this off. GUTFELD: I'm going to eat some chocolate, you shock him. WATTERS: No, that's not how it works. Thank you for not doing that Johnny. That's - two is enough. COMPAGNO: So that's the thing about it. Literally someone else can shock you if you can give it to a family member. So if your, like, little brother gets a hold of it, that would be all day long. WATTERS: Yes. I mean, it could work. But you have to have a high threshold of pain. Like you said, it has to really hit you. PERINO: How does it know? WATTERS: I have a very high pain threshold, so-- GUTFELD: Jump like jumping bean. WILLIAMS: They said you would have to have this for five days and it works. You have to like go through this for five days. So I think as a matter of impulse control, I don't - the only way this would work as aversion therapy is if you decide, yes, I've got a problem. GUTFELD: Right. WILLIAMS: But if you don't know you got a problem, I don't know. PERINO: But how does it know that you're reaching for chocolate? WILLIAMS: You know. GUTFELD: You have to see yourself, shock yourself. PERINO: No, nobody shocks themselves. GUTFELD: What if you're really into being shocked. Then you need an aversive and up - you need another bracelet to shock you when you want to be shocked. WATTERS: OK. Greg. (CROSSTALK) COMPAGNO: Greg, I dare you to put this one. GUTFELD: No, no, no. Look, I have enough problems to have to add another problem. WATTERS: If he gets shocked by this-- COMPAGNO: I will try it. WATTERS: This is going to create another you know what. WILLIAMS: Another what? GUTFELD: What? WATTERS: I think he's going to go anywhere. He goes to the hospital if he hits his head. GUTFELD: That's what you do when you hit your head. You got to the hospital. WATTERS: --some dirt on you. COMPAGNO: --when you hit your head. PERINO: All right, here go for the chocolate Emily. COMPAGNO: GUTFELD: He went to the hospital if they hit that. WILLIAMS: You want to shot-- (CROSSTALK) COMPAGNO: OK. I'm doing. Johnny do it. Nothing is happening. WILLIAMS: Not working. COMPAGNO: My heart is beating fast because I'm nervous. PERINO: Because he did something wrong. WATTERS: I worked on me Emily. WILLIAMS: All right. COMPAGNO: Oh, that is - that is. But you know what, its fine. WATTERS: I told you. What did I tell you? WILLIAMS: Kids OK. GUTFELD: Power of positive thinking. COMPAGNO: Once is enough. Just once is enough. WATTERS: I feel like I reacted a little heavier compared to her. COMPAGNO: I don't like this and it - it did a little me after. It's like a- - WATTERS: Yes, it's not nice. COMPAGNO: I don't like that. GUTFELD: Is this is annoying of children? WILLIAMS: Is this the party gag or is it real? COMPAGNO: It's real. WILLIAMS: I don't think anybody would buy it. COMPAGNO: I won't. All right \"One More Thing\" is up next. This things is like-- (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: \"One More Thing\", Dana. PERINO: All right. So everyone knows that puppy-dog eyes are - but really makes you attracted to puppies-- GUTFELD: They're tasty. (VIDEO PLAYING) PERINO: But turns out there's a new study that says that dogs have evolved to have puppy-dog eyes to attract humans. They have done this study that basically they have like these new eye muscles to communicate and possibly go to humans into feeding or caring to them. This is evolution at its finest. Of course, that's Jasper. But we had to get Rookie in here. Rookie is Jesse's dog. Here he is. Look at those eyes. And see they get more round and then you want to just kiss them. And then Duchess (ph) too, Duchess-- COMPAGNO: Yes, Duchess-- PERINO: This is Duchess Emily's dog right there. Interesting, researchers say that muscle used for expression is virtually absent in canine ancestors and wolves, so we could be watching evolution as we-- GUTFELD: This is means is your animals do not like you, they pretend to, so you don't kill them. That's all this is. GUTFELD: \"Animals are Great\", Greg. COMPAGNO: That's not. GUTFELD: Animals that aren't domesticated are great. All right. Oh, it's me? PERINO: \"Animals are Great\"? GUTFELD: No, not today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Greg's Fashion News. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: You know, it's not really fashion news. Let's just see who's sitting in Jesse's chair this week. (VIDEO PLAYING) GUTFELD: Oh, look who just showed up in your office? WATTERS: What? GUTFELD: Diamond and Silk, while you were doing this show. Diamond and Silk have been in your office and they found your hidden stash of porn. WATTERS: I shared that with you under strict confidence. GUTFELD: Anyway, this is an ongoing segment. We're just going to let people sit in your chair. WATTERS: Not nice. GUTFELD: I know, I know. I couldn't help it. All right. Juan. WILLIAMS: Anyway. Moving on. What would happen if someone came along and introduced your eyes to the wonderful world of color for the first? (VIDEO PLAYING) Take a look at this video. That's 17-year old G. Valoy, a Philadelphia company gave her a pair of glasses to correct her colorblindness. And as you can see the first thing that came to her eyes were tears. She walked over to one of her former teachers who asked Valoy if she could recognize the color of the teachers pants? Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOSHUAMI VALOY, STUDENT WITH COLORBLINDNESS: Is that red? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, that's red. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Yes, she said \"Is that red?\" \"I didn't know I'd be so overwhelmed\". Valoy will be studying psychology at Gannon University in Erie this fall. Many rainbows to you young lady. GUTFELD: Jesse. WATTERS: That's nice. All right. So do you guys wear cufflinks? GUTFELD: No. WATTERS: Greg, no, you don't wear cufflinks. Well, I have cufflinks here and check these guys out. These are Tic Tac cufflinks. There's a little Tic Tac in right there on the right and on the left. Tic Tac USA, if you go to their Instagram account, you can get the second pair of Tic Tac cufflinks in America. I have the only pair and the only other pair available if you to Instagram. You go to a board meeting, you have bad breath, you pop the Tic Tac in your mouth and then everybody listens to you. GUTFELD: Yes, that's the message. WATTERS: And it's not just Tic Tac, you can hide other pills in here if you want. GUTFELD: Write me immediately. Emily. COMPAGNO: OK. Great. So you guys know how much I love classic cars and Hot Rods and everything. (VIDEO PLAYING) COMPAGNO: So just recently a replica tribute car that was dedicated to \"Burt Reynolds and Smokey and the Bandit\" just sold at auction for 317 and it wasn't the actual car used. All the ones that were used on set were actually, like, beaten up and discarded. This is a pretty lucrative business to be in. And another one of the replicas went for almost $200,000 last October. And that by the way is my next dream car. It's the 78th version in silver gold. GUTFELD: You know who has that? WATTERS: Gorka. GUTFELD: John Rich. John Rich has that. COMPAGNO: He has in silver gold. GUTFELD: In his garage, yes he does. Ask him. Sure he will let you drive it. COMPAGNO: I will. GUTFELD: And no, Gorka has a convertible Mustang. PERINO: And you'll have to drive him in it. GUTFELD: Yes, episode of \"The Five.\" \"Special Report\" is up next. Hello, Bret. BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Hello Greg. This is Fox News alert. I'm Bret Baier.

      "content": "This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" July 2, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Hello everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Katie, Juan, Dana, and Greg. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \u201cThe Five.\u201d New York Democratic socialist, AOC, leveling bombshell allegations on conditions that migrant detention centers after she joined a group of House Democrats who visited two detention facilities in Texas yesterday, the congresswoman even reportedly screaming at border agents at one stop. Here are the explosive claims she's making about the treatment of those migrants. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: There's abuse in these facilities. There's abuse. This is them on their best behavior and they put them put them in rooms with no running water, and these women were being told by CBP officers to drink out of the toilet. They were drinking water out of the toilet. And that was them knowing a congressional visit was coming. This is CBP on their best behavior telling people to drink out of the toilet. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you see somebody actually do that? CORTEZ: I mean, in that last facility, I was not safe from the officers in that facility. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Border patrol issuing a harsh rebuttal to the freshman congresswoman firing back saying the accusations are not true. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can tell you with the utmost confidence that the migrants, anyone and everyone in our custody at all of our facilities have ready access to fresh water. They have access to consumables, and the standards that we apply to make sure that on a recurring and very timed basis that not only they have access to the types of consumables and fresh water that they would need. I've never heard in 26 years of being in this business ever heard of that type of allegation being made. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Greg, do you believe her? GREG GUTFELD, HOST: I would actually need to see some proof to this. I think it's just her being sneaky because I don't believe -- this is my gut is that there -- no one has been drinking from any toilet. But if you see that the water fountain is situated above the toilet for plumbing reasons in emergency shelter and often in correctional facilities, you will see that. You'll see the toilet and then it's the same. But for plumbing reasons because that's where the plumbing comes out of. So the water source is below. It's not toilet water. It's actually bath - - it's drinking water but it's above the toilet. But she's clever because she just broadly says they're drinking from the toilet. And then people can go like, oh, yeah, because the toilet is there. So I think that what she did was she said something that is false but directionally true. Like, meaning, she could get away with it. I do think -- I think the bigger story, too, is how the left has this free pass to demonize anyone. We've seen accusations of child abuse directed at people who work there. She suggested that these guys might sexually assault her. She doesn't feel safe around them. These are horrible things to say about people, casually, to say them casually. But if you respond angrily or you make a -- or criticize her, suddenly she becomes the victim. These are snowflake bearing switch blades. They come at you and the moment you respond it's like, oh, my God, you hate me. And it's like -- it is kind of weird. And the irony of this whole thing is the left incentivizes these crises by egging on two things. The caravans, they were encouraged as a way to overwhelm the border to create visuals. Next? They were incentivizes to bring children because we -- the activists were telling people it was easier to get across the border if you bring kids. It's easier to demonize the people that are meant to deal with this influx. And so the result is you have more sexual assaults, more drowning, and more deaths. I mean, these centers are probably the best relief that these people are going to get in this situation and they're being demonized by the very people who are incentivizing it. WATTERS: And she voted twice against bills that would have provided more resources for these migrants in these facilities, and then she goes down to the facility and says they're not getting the right resources. Looks pretty hypocritical. JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: Are you talking to me? WATTERS: I'm talking to Juan Williams. WILLIAMS: Because I think one of the things that happens here is we can politicize this and I'd just prefer we not do that. WATTERS: OK. WILLIAMS: But I will say this that the big news to me is to have this Facebook page group, the border patrol agents who have absolutely spoken in dehumanizing terms about the migrants. And they've also made awful sexual innuendo about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman. And now we have a DHS inspector general report in which the inspector general, Jesse says, three of the five stations have no shower for children. Kids have no change of clothes and no way to do laundry. And two of the stations, two of the five have no hot meals for kids. So these are not good situations. And if you then understand the kind of very hostile rhetoric that the agents have been taking part in on those Facebook page, then for the congresswoman to do her duty, which is to go to that station and to inspect it and to see the conditions and not just engage in political rhetoric in Washington, but actually go, I think she has a right to feel -- GUTFELD: So she did no political rhetoric down there? That wasn't a photo-op when she insulted those -- WILLIAMS: She didn't insult -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: I guess that's not political? WILLIAMS: Greg, I'll tell you what was insulting them talking about her in total -- GUTFELD: That -- we can go into that, too. But she called them child abusers. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: And they were running concentration camps. I think, Katie, we all agree we want the best for these migrants. We want to take care of them as best we can. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: They should not be here. They should have not come here. The way they came here it's an unfortunate situation. But the border patrol agents, they're not trained for this. They don't have the facilities. They don't have the money. They're doing the best they can. KATIE PAVLICH, HOST: Right. Well, I'm glad that she made a real trip to a detention center, to a shelter, instead of posing for a photo-op in front of an empty parking lot like she did the first time around with the photographer and her fake crying. That's the first step. The second thing is her outrageous, totally fraudulent because she voted against every single piece of legislation that would have, at least, eased the situation temporarily. The reason why, Juan, you're seeing a lack of facilities, a lack of food, a lack of clothing for children is because the border patrol is overwhelmed. These facilities are meant for maybe 1,000 people. There are 4 or 5,000 people who are crowding -- GUTFELD: How that happen? PAVLICH: -- these facilities. And that is happening because Congress and people like AOC continue to use this as a political talking point instead of actually solving the problem. When Wayfair sold beds to the border patrol to have beds for children who didn't have them, she led a boycott and said that they shouldn't be selling beds to children, and then she goes down there and says why don't any of these children have any beds? And so, it's completely disingenuous. And the fact is that this can be fixed. And if you want to be part of the solution that you just don't go down and call the border patrol sexual assaulters, sexual predators, Nazis, you actually vote for things that make it better. WATTERS: Yeah. And some of the witnesses down there, Dana, according to the Washington Examiner said she went in, started yelling and screaming at the border patrol officers. Refused a tour of the facility and mischaracterized the conversation she had with the detainees. DANA PERINO, HOST: It is pretty astonishing that you can have several people all saying what she said about drinking water out of the toilet, and you can have several people all saying what you're just describing here which is that how inappropriately she was acting and aggressively and hostile initially going in. And, look, obviously, emotions are running high. One of my favorite beatitudes are blessed are the meek. Who are the meek? The meek are the children. Are we responsible for taking care of children? We are at this point, at this moment. And I think what the administration has figured out is you have to figure out a way to triage this situation. So, one of the things they did today is -- of all the immigration fights, they decide we're going to print the census without the citizenship question. Whether they would have won on the merits, I think they probably would have, but there was -- there were problems with it. It is executive branch's responsibility to do the census. The president is going to get that done, fine. Take it off the table. They just got the $4.5 billion signed last week. The president signs that into law. It's not even enough money. So then they have to figure out how they can hire more people to deal what she's talking about. And then, I think the third thing, if you only got three wishes, the third thing has to be this asylum piece. On some of these must-pass pieces of legislation that are coming up in September, I would focus all sorts of resources on figuring out a way to change that because if they don't, I think what Greg is talking about, the caravans and the visuals, they know that the administration is under pressure, so they're going to continue to send people here. And we're not going to have enough -- we're not equipped to take care of them. WILLIAMS: But the incentive, Dana, is not about anything that we say, oh, you know, these kids aren't being taken care of. The incentive is these people are fleeing oppression and poverty and they want the better life for their families and children. PERINO: OK. But there still has -- PAVLICH: Still is a system. PERINO: Then everybody can talk about how do you fix the problem at its source? So they don't want to leave, like I'm for that. GUTFELD: And other countries should not be dictating our border policy by sending people. We cannot forget, the children are being used and abused as pass keys into a country. Who built that? The people in the United States who mock this humanitarian crisis months ago. We know who they are. WILLIAMS: I think AOC deserves a tip of the hat, by the way, for using her statue to shine a light on what's going on down there. GUTFELD: And making up stuff. WATTERS: I think a lot of people think she's exploiting the tragedy and then doing nothing about it, legislatively. Next, President Trump blasting the liberal establishment of ruining America great cities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: We cannot ruin our cities. And you have people that work in those cities, they work in office buildings and to get into the building they have to walk through a scene that nobody would have believed possible three years ago. And this is the liberal establishment. This is what I'm fighting. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: San Francisco continues to become the human poop capital of the western hemisphere. What is their mayor concerned with? E-cigs. Yeah, she signed an ordinance banning vaping sales, a first of its kind in the United States. Now, you don't have to vape to see how idiotic this is. But let me offer a plug. Vaping got me to quit smoking which is far more harmful. If vaping had been around 30 years ago so would a lot your relatives. I don't vape anymore, but it helped get me here. The mayor says there's much we don't know about these products, but you could have said the same thing about wind farms or cell phones. But no, she means vaping. So vaping is the health hazard in her city, as opposed to injecting heroin on the streets near a school. I guess when you can't address your city's big problems, you look to vaping as a distraction from failure. And what's pin done as S.F. is a monumental failure. It become a dystopian open sewer in which the super-rich liberals virtue signal from above, while the homeless relieve themselves below. It's clear that you can accept any kind of misery if you're well enough away from it. And so the rise in banning things will continue unless, of course, the homeless do it, or Antifa does it, or undocumented aliens do it, then breaking laws is simply the right thing to do because anything else would be hateful. So welcome to S.F. Please don't puff. But by all means, poop. We have a little sound on tape from the president -- yeah, I had to work in the word poop, about these cities decaying conditions thanks to the libs. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We cannot ruin our cities. And you have people who work in those cities. They work in office buildings, and to get into the building they have to walk through a scene that nobody would have believe possible three years ago. And, this is the liberal establishment. This is what I'm fighting. If you look at some of these -- they're usually sanctuary cities run by very liberal people, and the states are run by very liberal people. But the thing that nobody can figure out is do these governors or mayors, do they really think this is a positive? Do they really think this is OK? Because it's not. It's destroying their city. And it's destroying a whole way of life. And it's not our country. It's not what our country is all about. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Katie, is this just a coincidence that all these cities are run by liberals? PAVLICH: Well, homelessness has actually gone down in terms of the number of people over the past decade, but they have congregated in these big leftist cities because these policies that they've implemented in these liberal cities make living on the street easier. So, for example, creating safe spaces for people to do heroin, saying that you can sleep wherever you want, and go to the bathroom wherever you want in front of businesses. There's no rules. Creating public programs where you get things for free and you can still live out on the street. And it seems like these big city mayors who've created this problem through these leftist policies that enable this kind of bad behavior are creating problems like going after the vaping instead of really dealing with serious issues that they, themselves, have created. And it's a monster now because they have these huge congregations, you have in L.A. now diseases breaking out at these huge camps, and they don't know what to do about it. And the public programs that they've implemented aren't working. And so they're at the end of the rope in terms of dealing with this and they're just going on to vaping, and they'll be banning cereal and Cokes and the size of your drinks. WATTERS: Look at the tent. Tent on the middle of the sidewalk. PAVLICH: You're allowed to do that, right? I mean, if you're a business owner you complain. They say, well, the city ordinance says anybody can live anywhere. There has to be consequences for that. WATTERS: You have to get rid of these ordinances that say that you can just have an encampment on the middle of a public sidewalk. GUTFELD: You know what will happen? You'll have the left accusing you of concentration camp tactics, or being anti-compassionate, or being a horrible person for moving people. WATTERS: Well, that's why a liberal mayor in one these cities, they're the ones that have to take charge and show some political courage and say it's not compassionate to allow our cities to suffer like this. The compassionate thing to do is clean up the city. We haven't seen a mayor be able to do that. Dana, The Guardian the other day had a great story because we all suffer. Why San Francisco techies hate the city they transformed. And it's about all these young tech entrepreneurs that came in. They're paying astronomically high rents. PERINO: Yeah. WATTERS: They're riding their bikes to work. They're falling over homeless people. They're getting mugged. There's syringes and condoms right outside of where they sleep. It's disgusting. Homelessness has gone up 19 percent over the last 10 years in San Francisco. They've absolutely had it and these are liberal-minded people. PERINO: Yesterday there was a story in the Wall Street Journal that for the first -- thank you. GUTFELD: Yes. He quotes a paper, and now \u2013 PERINO: Yeah, he quoted the Guardian, and I quote the Wall Street Journal. (CROSSTALK) (LAUGHTER) PERINO: I set it aside because I wanted to fully read it, and I read the first page only. But the number of people moving to the suburbs from the city has gone up for the first time in about 10 years. And I think that this is a direct result of that because people who are -- not everyone that works in the tech business is 24-years-old without any children. These are people that are families. They are figuring out a way how are they going to educate their children and they're having to move out of the city and commute back and forth. One of the great things about living in the city is being able to do all of those things all at once. On the vaping thing? GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: So the concern is that they don't understand the effects on children and they're worried that the companies are marketing to children. GUTFELD: It's always about the children. PERINO: There are ways to deal with that that don't include banning adults from buying products -- GUTFELD: Exactly. PERINO: -- that help them stop smoking. GUTFELD: They always bring up the children when they don't have another argument, right? Juan, you should be happy that I quit smoking because of vaping. And this should be -- this should upset you that they're banning vaping because you should be happy that I benefit from it. WILLIAMS: I'm happy for you because I think that's good for your health. But I must say, they didn't ban vaping. GUTFELD: No, the selling of -- PERINO: The selling of it. WILLIAMS: Yeah, they just said -- they said they're not going to allow them to be sold. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: But I mean, to me, this is not about adults, Greg. Not about you. It's about the idea that children use the vaping as a gateway to, guess what? Start smoking cigarettes. GUTFELD: Not proven. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: The gateway is the weakest argument. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: That's the whole argument that even Jewel says that in their advertisement. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: But let me just say with regards to the homeless issue which I think is a far more serious issue, you guys are using this as a cudgel to beat up Democratic or liberal -- GUTFELD: No, we don't have to. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: But let me say, I think the person who's exploiting this issue is President Trump. PERINO: What? WILLIAMS: I think he's the one that's taking advantage of people who are homeless, people who are mentally ill, people who are veterans who have PTSD -- GUTFELD: Taking advantage by trying to get them help? WILLIAMS: No. If he was trying to get them help, that would be great, Greg. But his budget eliminated money for the one organization the government that was aimed at the homeless. GUTFELD: This is the argument that -- just gave for AOC. WILLIAMS: No, I'm just saying, this is, to me, crass behavior by our president because he's just about the politics. WATTERS: We just showed you how you can spend millions of dollars in skid row trying to clean that up and the homelessness got worse there. It's not about the money, Juan. It's about the policies on the local level. WILLIAMS: This is not true. Katie just told you at the very start of this segment, in fact, homelessness overall is down. But you get to warm cities like L.A., San Francisco, that's different. GUTFELD: All right. We have breaking news in the trial of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher. Verdict has been reached, details coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: This is a Fox News alert, a jury has reached a verdict in the murder trial of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher. Gallagher was accused of killing a war prisoner in Iraq. Now, Jonathan Hunt live outside the naval base courthouse in San Diego. Jonathan? JONATHAN HUNT, CORRESPONDENT: Juan, the breaking news here right now Chief Edward Gallagher is not guilty of murdering that ISIS prisoner in Iraq in 2017. He is not guilty of shooting at civilians in a crowd in Iraq. He is not guilty of firing from a sniper position at an elderly man. He is not guilty of firing at a young Iraqi woman from a sniper position, too. We understand at this point the only charge on which he has been found guilty is posing for a photograph with the body of that ISIS prisoner. He is guilty. The jury has decided on that charge. But, that is the least serious of the seven charges he was facing. It carries a maximum prison sentence of four months, given that Chief Gallagher has already served that time. We understand he will walk out of this courtroom behind me shortly a free man and will be free to celebrate the Fourth of July with his family. The breaking news, Chief Edward Gallagher, once again, not guilty on all the most serious war crimes charges against him, guilty only of posing for a picture with the body of a dead ISIS fighter. He will, tonight, be free. Juan? WILLIAMS: Jonathan, please stand with us. Dana Perino has a question for you. PERINO: Hi, Jonathan, I know we expected this verdict today. Like, this pretty quickly decided. I thought you could ask -- remind the viewers of two things. One, about the twist in this story that happened last week when the other navy seal who was given immunity by the prosecution admitted that he, in fact, was the one who killed the ISIS fighter and prisoner. Secondly, I do think it's important for people to understand how this works. This is not your typical jury. This is a jury of his peers, other military men. HUNT: Yeah. I'll take those in order. First of all, the bombshell testimony we got earlier in this trial was from a seal team 7 member by the name of Corey Scott. He was on the stand. He said that Chief Gallagher did, indeed, stab the ISIS fighter, but then he said that ISIS fighter died of asphyxiation. On cross-examination by the defense, he then said what do you mean by asphyxiation? That is a very specific term? And Corey Scott said yes, it was a very specific term. And what he meant by that was he put his thumb over a breathing tube that had been inserted into that ISIS prisoner and he suffocated him. He said he did it as a mercy killing because he did not want that ISIS fighter to go back into the hands of the Iraqi emergency response division which he said had been guilty previously of the torture, rape, and murder of ISIS prisoners. So Corey Scott dropped that bombshell. Chief Gallagher did not kill that ISIS prisoner, I, Corey Scott killed him. Now on the question of the jury that you mentioned as well, Dana. It's a jury of seven military men, five enlisted, two officers. You need to get five out of those seven to have a conviction. So, obviously, they have reached five out of seven on the posing with a -- for a picture with the ISIS fighter. They did not get to five out of seven on any of the other charges. I don't have the exact numbers yet. But the bottom line is Chief Gallagher is tonight free to walk out of this court and go home with and to his family. Dana? WILLIAMS: Jonathan, just quickly, following up on Dana's point, Corey Scott cannot be prosecuted even though he admitted to ending that person's life? HUNT: Right. He had been given immunity against being charged with killing or any other offenses in this case. Now, the one thing, Juan, that he can be charged with is perjury. Now, obviously, prosecutors said that they -- he changed his story. He told them one thing in investigative interview and then changed his story when he got on the witness stand with immunity. They say he did that because he wanted to protect Chief Gallagher. So they have kept open their positions that they can prosecute him for perjury. We got hold just last week of an email sent to his attorney by the navy clearly laying out that they have the right now to go forward with a perjury case against Corey Scott if they decide to do so. As we understand it, that decision has not been taken yet. But it remains a possibility, Juan. WILLIAMS: Jonathan, Katie Pavlich has a question. PAVLICH: Hi, Jonathan. Can you take us through what the mood in the courtroom was today, and when the verdict came down? HUNT: Yeah. That's a very good question, Katie. You know I sensed a real difference in the mood of Chief Gallagher and his wife Andrea from yesterday afternoon. When they expected, I think, a really quick verdict, they didn't get it. They look at little down trodden when they left last night. They looked genuinely concerned when they came in today, and as this dragged out by hour by hour today. But Dan Gallo, our extremely talented producer, who's been in the courtroom throughout this just, came out and told me there was an extraordinary atmosphere in the courtroom when each of those verdicts were read. A lot of tears, he said, hugs between Chief Gallagher and his wife Andrea who has been with him every single minute of every single day of this trial. Huge hugs then between the Chief, Andrea and Chief Gallagher's parents who have also been in the courtroom every day. And obviously, handshakes and hugs with all of the defense attorneys who have got him to this point, where as I say, he is free to go home with and to his family tonight. WILLIAMS: Jonathan, Dana wants to ask another question. PERINO: And just one last question, for you Jonathan, because this case was so unusual and it exposed this intramural of deep divisions among some of the Navy SEALs who served under Gallagher. I remember listening to Gallagher's defense - the defense attorney at one point referring to them as Millennials, and like a lot of tension there, any comment on that before we let you go? HUNT: Yes, Dana there is no stronger bond perhaps anywhere in the U.S. military than the brotherhood between SEALs and this trial has certainly exposed that. It is torn of the thread that binds the SEAL community together. There will certainly be ramifications. This division of the SEALs, the protruding caught between the older SEALs, hard-charging SEALs like Chief Eddie Gallagher, and the younger as you mentioned, then they were described by defense attorneys, the Millennial SEALs who they portrayed as not wanting to really join the fray to join the fight. So certainly in what is an extraordinarily tight-knit community under usual circumstances, these very unusual circumstances are going to test the bonds of friendship throughout the U.S. Navy SEAL community, Dana. PERINO: Thank you. WILLIAMS: Jonathan, thank you so much for that breaking news update. Again Mr. Gallagher was found not guilty on, I believe, it was all but one count and the one count was posing with a picture of a deceased enemy. Controversy erupts as Nike drops an American flag themed sneaker. That's coming at you next on \u201cThe Five.\u201d (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAVLICH: Well, as we approach the 4th of July holiday, not everyone is preaching American greatness. Nike has dropped a Betsy Ross themed 4th of July sneaker after Colin Kaepernick complained that the American flag symbol is offensive. The company releasing a statement that the sneakers could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation's patriotic holiday. Meanwhile, Arizona's Governor has withdrawn funding for a Nike manufacturing plant there. So, Greg -- GUTFELD: Yes. PAVLICH: You actually liked the look of these shoes. They're no longer on sale. But what do you think about the controversy and the impact that Colin Kaepernick apparently has on all kinds of American flags. GUTFELD: You know, I think, in this in this era of the woke a dial (ph), which is basically a crocodile that will eat you if you're not woke enough, you can't run from it. So even Nike trying to be patriotic and woke isn't even safe. So one it could because Colin Kaepernick didn't like it, so they have to get rid of it. So the woke a dial comes for everybody. I hate this slippery slope argument, because it's so easy. But when people were talking about, \"Hey, first the statues, then what's next, money, then what's next flags\". Well why do we even have a July 4th? Like just go from July 3rd to July 5th just get rid of the whole damn thing. It's so complicated and problematic July 4th. Why are we celebrating a country with a legacy of slavery? Why are we doing that? It's disgusting. I mean you can hear the argument. Right now you're seeing signs though that that sensible liberals are beginning to see that there's no off-ramp for this kind of thinking, even at - like almost every show now Bill Maher is shaking his head saying, \"Come on guys we're going too far\". And you're seeing you're seeing liberals like Dave Rubin, who you had on your show, they're thinkers without a party. They're thinkers without a side, because they're just going so far. Your team is nuts. Do you need, is my pitch too sensible liberals, ask yourself where this trend is going to end up? Where is it going? Do these people want the end of this country? WATTERS: I think they do want the end of the country. I think they're trying to destroy the flag, try and destroy the national anthem, the borders, the Presidents - if you look at what they did to the statues. They want to change everything about this country and have full control over it. And so when someone like this guy who's Anti-American can dictate to an American company to not celebrate our independence on July 4th, we are in a really sad state. I agree, this country was flawed. It was founded on slavery and we fought a civil war to end that stain. But that doesn't define America - slavery. It was a huge mistake. We're constantly trying to rectify it. But to say that we have to just get rid of everything about this country, everything about the founding of this country, because of slavery, that does not unite the country. That tries to erase everything and it doesn't move it forward and instead we should be trying to have a conversation about improving the country. But all this does is divide and that's what Colin wants. He's unhappy with himself. He's a bitter man. And he wants to divide the country and make everybody else feel as miserable as he does. WILLIAMS: Can I just stop this for a second because it's so - such a distortion. I don't know where to begin. First of all, I think we all believe in capitalism, right? And I think Nike is a private company. And I think Nike stock has gone up since they really backed Colin Kaepernick in terms of his stand kneeling as a protest during NFL games. But the second thing is - and again this is distortion, is that they're not condemning America, they're saying that this Betsy Ross flag, once they were alerted to it, Colin Kaepernick didn't make the decision. Nike made the decision. But he did tell them that this Betsy Ross flag has been well hijacked by Far-Right, Neo-Nazi, White Nationalist-- WATTERS: Really, Juan - stop. GUTFELD: Really? WILLIAMS: Let me finish. GUTFELD: You always do. WILLIAMS: Neo-Nazi groups, because not only is it the case that they have taken this like they took \"Pepe the Frog\", but they-- WATTERS: What are you talking about Juan? WILLIAMS: --that this Far-Right, White Nationalist group-- WATTERS: No one is to hijack the Betsy Ross with-- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: In fact, in 2016 at a high school basketball game, school that was all-white was playing a school with mixed race basketball team and you saw some of the students waving it. The school superintendent, who was white said, \"It has become a symbol of exclusion and racist\" PAVLICH: OK. OK. So wait let me interrupt-- WATTERS: No, it hasn't Juan. WILLIAMS: Yes, it has. WATTERS: No one has it and you know that Juan. PAVLICH: OK. Let me just - let me take just a step back, so even if it's been hijacked allegedly-- PERINO: It has been. PAVLICH: --it's a part of American history. Betsy Ross is a hero in the history of America as part of the American Revolution. She was amazing. She should be celebrated. WATTERS: As Jesse pointed out on the \"Daily Briefing\" she's a feminist icon. PAVLICH: Indeed. GUTFELD: She is not woken up though. And she's dead so she can't defend herself. PERINO: So companies are continually - are more and more often having to deal with this, especially with younger people, either like their employees or now on their boards, whatever. So look at what happened at Wayfair last week, right. They're like, \"Well, we don't want to build those beds\". Well, who's going to build the beds? Every corporation in America needs to be prepared for this, because it's coming for you in one way or another in terms the slippery slope Greg talked about. The thing about this flag is - OK so Colin Kaepernick has a view, you buy Nike or not, I don't care, like whatever. But here's the thing. This country, that flag and this - what Thursday means to us is, we were this young upstart country. It was actually founded on an idea that \"All men are created equal\". And, yes, we had a birth defect as Condoleezza Rice has pointed to that - has pointed out. There were people who fought in a war to try to end slavery. We have tried - we are dealing with race, we are trying to deal with it. You - again, you can buy those shoes or not. But here's what you cannot deny. The country was built on an idea. Do you think it is a good idea, still? I do and I plan to celebrate on the 4th of July. Shoes or no shoes. WILLIAMS: Yes. One of the ideas-- PAVLICH: I mean, go barefoot. GUTFELD: Go barefoot. PERINO: OK. WILLIAMS: One of the ideas we were founded on is, you can have unpopular opinions. PERINO: Fine. All right. GUTFELD: You would, Juan. WILLIAMS: Yes, I would. Thank you. Thank you. PAVLICH: OK. Hang tight. We've got the \"Fastest 7\" up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: Welcome back. Time for the \"Fastest 7\". We might only have five. So first up, Marianne Williamson captured the hearts of many Americans, including Greg's and Jesse's after this debate performance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARIANNE WILLIAMSON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So, Mr. President, if you're listening, you have harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out. I'm going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field and, sir, love will win. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: And now her fans are up in arms after she was left off Vogue's recent \"Women of 2020\" photo shoot featuring five female presidential candidates. Seen here laughing and high-fiving each other. It's not yet known why she was left out. Katie, I can imagine why? PAVLICH: I know why, because it was a shoot for Members of Congress who are running for President who are women, not just we a woman. PERINO: You are just figuring out a way to exclude her. PAVLICH: No. GUTFELD: How convenient. PAVLICH: She is not in Congress. GUTFELD: Why are you carrying water from them? PAVLICH: I'm just saying it was about women in Congress running for President. WILLIAMS: Great, doesn't like it when you tell the facts. PAVLICH: Maybe she should be on the cover of Vogue by herself. PERINO: Oh, maybe she just might. PAVLICH: On the field of love. PERINO: Jesse what do you think? WATTERS: I would disagree with Katie. I think they excluded her on purpose and then afterwards made it about women running -- (CROSSTALK) PERINO: But the thing is, it could work in Marianne's favor. GUTFELD: Marianne, if you're listening, come on my podcast. My podcast is nothing if not love. And you may disagree with what I have to say. But when you - when I say it, you will feel nothing, but my sensual appeal. WILLIAMS: Why are you speaking like that? PERINO: Because he is imitating her-- WILLIAMS: That's the way she speaks? WATTERS: Juan. PAVLICH: That's the way it come on the podcast. PERINO: You did not see it? WILLIAMS: So, I didn't see - I didn't know. I didn't see it like that. I thought that was pretty good, though. I don't know what it was though-- PERINO: Love. WILLIAMS: I mean, the idea that Republicans are also trying to raise money for, tells you a whole lot. Didn't it? WATTERS: I'm switching registrations. I'm voting Democrat for Marianne. PERINO: And now we got another one. This is something that was amazing to happen. 15 year old Cori \"Coco\"-- shocker at Wimbledon yesterday, she beat the five time champ, Venus Williams defeated by this 15-year-old. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Standing ovation. \"Coco\" Gauff topples Venus Williams -- (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: All right. \"Coco\" Gauff, the youngest woman ever to win a match since 1991. It could be the turning of a page, Greg, the new generation is coming up. GUTFELD: This is why we don't have 15 year olds on THE FIVE. I don't want some brat humiliating me. This is like beating - I mean - and also she beat her idol. This is like me losing checkers to Kilmeade. PERINO: She won 6-4 6-4. WATTERS: I just like the nickname \"Coco\". Is that her real name or her nickname? PERINO: I think it's her nickname. WATTERS: I mean, that's an amazing name and she probably won't just own that alone. PERINO: Well, I think there's some skill involved, Katie? PAVLICH: I love this, because it was her idol and she - you have to work, right? And she worked for it-- PERINO: It's almost like she almost fell a little bad, Juan? PAVLICH: Almost, but not really. WILLIAMS: I think she did. You know what I say in interview with her, Dana, and they asked her about her schooling, because she's homeschooled to - because she does tennis all the time. And she said she just got a B on her science test. And they said, \"Well, what would you get yourself as a grade on that tennis match?\" And she smiled and said, \"an A\" and everybody just laughed. PAVLICH: \"A++\". PERINO: I'll give her an \"A\" on that one. OK. We got one last story for you. I love this one. Finally, \"The Bachelorette\" hunk, I guess that's his name. No, his name is Tyler Cameron. He got all the hearts racing on the hit reality show. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TYLER CAMERON, CONTESTANT, \"THE BACHELORETTE\": Hey, I'm Tyler. I'm 26 years old. I'm a general contractor in Jupiter, Florida. But I'm not your average contractor. I love to dance. I was like two classes away from being a Dance Minor at Wake Forest. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: And he's got all the hearts racing in real life. The eligible bachelor was out for a jog recently in New York City and followed by a group of over a hundred adoring young women running after him. It's all part of his informal jogging club that his - he advertises on Instagram. I was thinking, Greg, this is something you might try. GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: But it's a walk. GUTFELD: Yes, it's a slow walk. I find this to be disgusting, heteronormative behavior. You have one cisgender finding other another cisgender attractive, because of biology? This is disgusting. PERINO: Now let's-- GUTFELD: I'm organizing a protest. PERINO: Katie-- GUTFELD: You should be able to chase whoever you want. PERINO: Katie, the first night that there was about 60 women that showed up. Then there were a 100 women and now there's even has a Nike running coach Jess Woods is volunteering to help out, because I mean, there's like 100 young women out there running. PAVLICH: They should do this for charity. Other than that it's pathetic and stupid. PERINO: I don't know. What about people getting out there to exercise, Jesse? WATTERS: Exercise is good. The guy is really handsome. I mean -- PAVLICH: Would you run after him in Central Park? WATTERS: I might - run club. I mean, that's a good-looking guy. PERINO: Juan, will this get you to start watching reality TV? WILLIAMS: No, but I must say it's great advertising. I think that's the thing. I mean, it's very effective. PERINO: I think, getting out there and running is absolutely wonderful. WATTERS: Peter, don't let her join the run club. PERINO: \"One More Thing\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: It is time now for \"One More Thing\". Gregory? GUTFELD: Let's do this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Greg's Relationship News\" (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: You know, this is a brilliant idea and it should be used across all restaurants. When you go out and you're out with your date, and she's like I'm not really hungry. And then you order food, and then she starts eating off your plate. Mama D's Diner in North Little Rock, Arkansas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Check out the menu. You got all the food. Right in the - in the corner there, you got \"My Girlfriend's Not Hungry\" thing which offers extra French fries, fried chicken wings and fried cheese sticks for an extra 4.25, because you know she's going to eat off your plate. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: I think this is very smart, if not sexist. But it should have been like avocado toast, kale with pine nuts and a smoothie. PERINO: But you don't take - you never eat that off of your husband's plate. GUTFELD: But, yes, you always-- PERINO: You always want the fries. GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: All right. Dana. PERINO: OK. What better way to start the summer than this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TEXT: Dana's Book Club. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: Dana's Book Club. OK. My friend Cristina Alger, she wrote this book it's called \"Girls Like Us\". It's out today. I read it in six hours on Saturday. I loved it, could not put it down. It's a mystery so well- written. She also has written \"The Darlings\" and she wrote \"The Banker's Wife\", which was one of the books I recommended last year. Highly recommend. It's a mystery. GUTFELD: Is it \"Girls Like Us\" or girls like us. PERINO: Girls Like Us\". GUTFELD: OK. I thought it was something else. PERINO: Like us. Like you and me. GUTFELD: It's not the kind of book I'll read that. PAVLICH: --the \"Banker's Wife\" and I think I lost it and now I need to finish it. PERINO: Yes, you do. Christina Alger, she's a great writer. WATTERS: It was like it's just six hours, Dana? PERINO: Yes. WATTERS: Seemed little slow. WILLIAMS: All right. Talk about the thrill of the hunt. How about the thrill of being hunted. Take a look at this video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: That's a tiger chasing down a motorcyclist as he drives through a national park in Southern India. Tigers can reach 40 miles an hour. But lucky for that motorcycle driver, this tiger had an injured right leg which slowed him down. National park officials found the animal, tranquilized him, before sending him off to a zoo. The park is home to 72 Bengal tigers and one of their Tigers actually killed three people earlier this year. PERINO: Wait. Why are you allowed to ride your motorcycle? (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: It's a road, Dana. GUTFELD: They're firemen. WILLIAMS: But - anyway, so I don't know about you. But if I was a motorcyclist folks, I'd stick, like Dana said, to the highway. WATTERS: Yikes. OK everybody. You guys remember the - what was the ice bucket challenge. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Well, there is a new challenge, it's called the bottle cap challenge where people - well, it's got John Mayer and other celebrities do this little karate kick and try to kick off with a little backspin kick the top of the bottle cap. There he goes. So I tried to see if I could do it, to see if I could try and - didn't go so well. I tried my best. I wet Johnny. He soaked. He had to change his outfit. But you know, it's not for everybody. My pants were a little tight, that's why I didn't execute it perfectly. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Also tonight it's \"Tuesdays with Watters\". Wednesday, we couldn't wait for it. They had to have it on Tuesday, so there you go. Also I'm one lucky guy tomorrow on \"Outnumbered\"-- PAVLICH: Oh boy -- WATTERS: At noon Eastern. PAVLICH: I'm watching that. WATTERS: Check that out. PAVLICH: You're wearing shorts? WATTERS: I will not. Never again. Never again. Katie? PAVLICH: All right. So I picked this for Dana mostly, because cities across the country are dealing with scooter rage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAVLICH: And there appears to be an aggressive backlash growing against these scooters. So they're electronic and city dwellers have actually been fighting back by throwing them into rivers and burying them in the sand, because they're sick of it. Last week the Portland Sheriff's Office they're pulled more than 50 scooters and even a few bike shares out of the river because people are so sick of them taking up the sidewalks, so they jokingly said, \"Don't park your scooters in the river, please\". But as you can imagine, people are sick of them. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAVLICH: So. I think it's also a theft to throw them in the river. It's probably not a good idea. WATTERS: Yes. PERINO: Well, that's pathetic (ph) act-- WATTERS: Those are scooters, that's not right and not very environmentally friendly. GUTFELD: Oh wow, Jesse. Surprised that you care. WATTERS: Green waters, it's a real thing, right, and very friendly. I don't use straws at all. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of \u201cThe Five.\u201d \"Special Report\" is up next with Mike.

Democrats -- they are very anxious this very night, very anxious. Jerry Nadler, all of a sudden, is beginning to sweat. The cowardly Schiff? Well, he's looking more shifty than he usually is. Probably, he's the only guy caught on tape actually colluding with Russians. Oh, tell me what you have. Oh, we've got naked pictures of Trump. Does Vladimir know? It's all on tape. That idiot, he thought he was getting intel to impact our elections. Why don't we look and investigate that guy. Anyway, I digress. The infighting between Pelosi and her radical base is getting worse every single day, and the fringe far left candidates running to be president are more than scary, they are also less than inspiring, and their ideas are chilling, but the Democratic Party tonight as we come on the air, they are in shambles and for good reason. A multiyear Russian collusion hoax was a failure. Trump winning happened. They can't accept truth and reality. Four investigations have exonerated the president. And, by the way, look at his presidency, a huge success. Thank goodness, thank God, the economy is booming. The forgotten men and women, nearly 7 million Americans off of food stamps, as many out of poverty, and we have the lowest unemployment, the best employment situation since 1969. And yes, people left behind. Every demographic are doing better, setting record low unemployment numbers in this country. That is great news. But for the Democrats -- well, they are playing, I guess, whatever they always do, games. They're not doing anything to help the American people. They don't have any agenda that's going to solve our problems. It's a card they keep playing over and over again. Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. Maybe if we investigate a hundred times, we'll get the conclusion we want. It doesn't work that way, because in their desperate effort to keep their Russian collusion hoax, their conspiracy theories alive for as long as possible, well, Chairman Jerry Nadler of the Judiciary Committee, the Intel chair, that's frightening, Adam \"The Cowardly\" Schiff, they are forcing Bob Mueller to testify into public on Capitol Hill, and he kind of said he didn't want to do it, and he's only going to stick to the report. We'll see next Wednesday. I don't think it's going to work out the way they think. As a matter of fact, I'm almost certain. According to the \"A.P.\", the Democrats are now beginning to listen to \u201cHannity.\u201d They are worried about next Wednesday's hearing. I'm excited about it. They should be. Robert Mueller has long said that the report will speak for itself. No collusion, no conspiracy, zero charges for obstruction of justice. And that was decided, as it should be, a special counsel law, if they actually read it, by the attorney general, the deputy attorney general, and the Office of the Legal Counsel. Those questions have all been thoroughly answered in the exhausted, frankly, political, poorly written, horribly, you know, law based, 448-page report. Meanwhile, Republicans should focus on the litany of what our unanswered questions that we have previewed on this program last night, we are going to do a full hour tomorrow night. The political bias, the prosecutorial misconduct, politics, conflict of interest, so many other crucial topics will finally get the attention they deserve. And that's going to come from the Republicans on the committee. And it's coming. And this comes as the Democrats' frenzied calls for impeachments, they are actually going quiet. Look at this from \"Politico\". Quote: the most prominent House advocates for impeachment proceedings acknowledge the push has, yes, slowed to a standstill. That means, if you want to go ahead, great. But that's going to guarantee Trump's reelection and the Republicans get control of the of the House and Senate, and we can solve more of America's problems and help the forgotten men and women even more become richer, raise the standard of living, and become energy independent where the Strait of Hormuz will never matter to us again in terms of strategic foreign policy. But that's not stopping Nadler's never-ending subpoena party. Look at what he wants now. He wants to now plan to, again, forcibly interview a boatload of current, former administration officials as part of what is now the fifth official -- fifth official -- duplicate investigation into what we already know, there was no Trump-Russia collusion or conspiracy. And the cowardly Schiff, the guy who's on tape colluding with the Russian guy? Well, he is conducting a separate, sixth investigation. How many bites of the apple do they want? President Trump summed it up perfectly. He wrote, quote: Democrats have asked to see 12 more people who have already spent hours with Robert Mueller, spent a fortune on lawyers in doing so? How many bites of the apple can they get to before working on border loopholes, asylum, oh, and maybe jobs, and keeping America safe, secure, and prosperous? And as you watch all this, you got to wonder, do they care about anybody in the country besides themselves and their psychotic rage and hatred towards Trump? This is beyond a psychosis. Now, Democrats don't care if they bankrupt private citizens with legal bills. Not only did they testify before Mueller, they want them to answer the same answers they've given to the House committee, the Senate committee, the Mueller report. How many more times you're going to -- this is harassment. They should be caring about what is a desperate situation at the border. They don't even care about the so-called Dreamers or DACA, which they claim they used to. They could have agreed to the president's compromise. They refused to even sit and talk with them. And now, the only thing Democrats seem to care about is smearing, besmirching, and slandering the president and destroying anyone and everyone who supports him. And quite frankly, this is beyond sick. A great deal maker is now in the White House. He's willing to negotiate even with you people that hate him, with both sides of the aisle, on so many important issues to move the country forward, to help -- let's see -- the carpenters, the plumbers, the electricians, the nurses, and everybody else in America, raise their standard of living. Is that what they are focused on? No. Because the people on the left and their buddies in the media mob, they can't see through the fog of their own rage to sit and come through the table and solve America's problems and make America a better, safer place for our children and grandchildren. Oh, what a novel idea. Instead, they are still obsessively talking about conspiracy theories, hoax, and lies that they've been pedaling for over two years, and a stack of frivolous subpoenas from the washed up lawyers in the Democratic House. Let me get back to my monologue. By the way, I have advice for people. If you've gone and you've cooperated and you've answered the questions again and again and again, my advice is you may want to say, you know what? I'm done. Fifth Amendment, I don't have to say anything. Just an idea, but what do I know? I'm only a talk show host. Joining us now with much more, our own Catherine Herridge, who's done a great job breaking many aspects of this story on so many levels. Catherine, what do you have tonight? CATHERINE HERRIDGE, CORRESPONDENT: Sean, good evening. The Democrat-led committee signing off on a dozen subpoenas today, almost all have nothing to do with Russian collusion, instead focusing on alleged obstruction of justice by the president. The Democrats claiming that there is still more to find after Robert Mueller's lengthy two-year investigation. The former special counsel's public testimony next week is already causing a lot of heartburn on both sides of the aisle. The two Democratic-controlled House committees, Judiciary led by Jerry Nadler and intelligence led by Adam Schiff, have allotted two hours for a morning and afternoon session on July 17th. That means about two dozen lawmakers will never ask their questions, and that violates a long-standing practice known as House Rule 11 that says every members gets five minutes to cross-examine the witness. (BEGIN VIDEO CLPI) REP. DEBBIE LESKO, R-ARIZ.: And I don't even get a chance to question him? This is just plain wrong. I have been elected just like anybody else here, and for the leadership on this committee to decide that only certain members and there's only time for certain members to be questioned, even on your side of the aisle, is just plain wrong. (END VIDEO CLIP) HERRIDGE: And listen to this exchange where Chairman Nadler won't explain how he'll cut special counsel Mueller's testimony when the two hour time limit runs out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DOUG COLLINS, R-GA: I'll pose the question, that's to the chairman again, if he would like to explain. How will you actually expect to stop the hearing next week? REP. JERRY NADLER, D-N.Y.: I'm going to repeat what I said a few minutes ago. This line of discussion, frankly, is beyond the scope of this markup and I'm not going to comment further. (END VIDEO CLIP) HERRIDGE: Republicans could use a number of tactics to run out the clock, effectively derailing the Democrats' star witness, Sean, and thank you for the kind words. HANNITY: You know, Catherine, an interesting part of this. Remember back -- we had the independent counsel statute, Ken Starr. And Nadler didn't want that report, which as a matter of law had to be made public. The special counsel law, which people like Nadler wanted to change, the attorney general was the one who would get the report, didn't want to release any of it. And as we all know, Attorney General Barr did, and more importantly, we the public got to see everything but one full line and seven partial sentences, and now, Mueller is testifying, and everything that they use to not want, now they wanted -- they have, and now they don't want it. HERRIDGE: I think it's worth noting that the Democrats are very focused on these allegations of obstruction of justice and the Mueller report is two volumes and it's that second volume on obstruction that virtually has no redactions, yet they continue to seek witness testimony about the underlying evidence. HANNITY: Well said, and they got to see the entire document themselves, unredacted completely, in spite of what they've been saying, some of them publicly. Great work, as always. Catherine Herridge in Washington. While House Democrats waste your money investigating their conspiracy theory, now for the fifth and a sixth time -- well, the organization tasked with electing them, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, they are also playing dirty tonight. No surprise. According to a brand-new report just breaking moments ago, investigative reporter, \"The Hill's\" vice president, John Solomon, the DCCC publishes much of their op research online, under a random URL so that Democratic allies can access all of this expensive material, and if they have the link without technically violating any campaign finance laws. We'll have more on this in a moment. But first, we do turn to the DOJ's internal watchdog, the inspector general, who has now been hard at work looking for the serious abuse of power and corruption that we've been telling you about. According to the DOJ, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, his team has reviewed, get this, more than a million records and conducted a hundred interviews into the FISA abuse and the finding of this probe. We expect in the middle of May, late May. But the timeline is now in flux, why? Because of two reasons, a last- minute interview that became available with Christopher Steele. I think he's worried about what other people are saying about him. Over the course of two days, nearly 16 hours, the author of Hillary's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier sat down with our investigators. Now, of course, the Clinton bought and paid for op research was the very basis, the bulk of information, as the Nunes, Grassley-Graham memo will say of the FISA warrant applications against Carter Page which backdoored and literally spying on the Trump campaign, the Trump transition, and even the Trump presidency. As former FBI Director Andrew McCabe put it, if we didn't have the phony Clinton bought and paid for dossier, I'm adding these words, no FISA. So, get this, Comey, McCabe, Brennan, Clapper and others have expressed so much outrage at the thought of Trump-Russia collusion, all while using what was we now know an unverifiable document, because even its author said, I have no idea if any of its true, filled with Russian propaganda misinformation. They did it first to rig the presidential election, and then secondly to bludgeon the president that they didn't want to win. My message to Jim Comey and his friends in the deep state -- well, you may want to remain silent, the truth shall set you free. Come to think of it, in Comey's case, it might be the exact opposite. Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, and Judicial Watch's president, Tom Fitton, is with us. Good to see you all. Gregg, I will start with you. Now, what's so interesting toto me about this, what my sources have told me. I'll get to you, Sara, and Tom to weigh in, I was told Horowitz was done. GREGG JARRETT, LEGAL ANALSYT: Yes. HANNITY: Then people who already talked to him, they sense they might be in trouble and they wanted to add more to the record. Secondly, Christopher Steele becomes available and other witnesses that were not willing to talk now are willing to talk. So, there's a real justification for the delay. JARRETT: Steele is critical because he can blow the lid on the conspiracy at the FBI. He can say, I warned them that this was unverified and unverifiable information. It was, quote, \"raw intelligence based on limited intelligence,\" end of quote. He's got to say that because he said it under oath in a civil lawsuit. To say otherwise would be perjury. So -- and he will also expose the information wondering (ph) scheme that the FBI used to hide the source of all of this information and lie to a FISA court. So he is a critical witness. In so far as Horowitz is concerned, his problem is he can only compel those who are current FBI and DOJ employees, and they always engage in what is called a phalanx strategy to obstruct, to protect their colleagues and protect the institution, which is why Durham's investigation is vital, because he can compel people with subpoenas to testify in front of a grand jury. But people like Comey will invoke the Fifth because he's in legal jeopardy. HANNITY: Interesting. I don't doubt your -- I don't think you are wrong, let me put it that way. Sara, let me go to you. It's interesting now, as we get closer, oh, we want Mueller to testify. Now they are trying to prohibit congressmen, elected officials -- originally, remember, they wanted somebody else to do the interviewing of other people. Like, no, that's your job. That's why you are elected. You're accountable. Not some unaccountable lawyer because you're afraid to do your job. But here's -- not only are they trying to silence members, but now they are beginning to realize, uh-oh, this Mueller thing, Hannity may be right, this could boomerang like everything else. Mueller is now on record three times on one position and that is about obstruction. It was clear there was no collusion. That's the fourth time now we've got that verdict. But here's the problem. At first, he told Bill Barr, it was never a consideration, the DOJ policy, our constitutional considerations of whether or not you could indict a sitting president. So, first, he said that, Barr and others, they all heard it. Then he had a nine on the half minute disaster -- and I don't even know he was reading somebody else's words. SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR: That's right. HANNITY: Then Barr bailed him out in a joint statement with the special counsel at attorney general. My point to the question is, so it didn't impact, it didn't impact for five hours, it didn't impact again. That, to me -- once he says, no, that wasn't a consideration. We didn't have the evidence to make that decision. It's over. CARTER: That's right, they have no place to go, and they realized that now. They are kind of trapped in a corner, Sean, and this is what the Democrats are coming to terms with right now, that all of this has backfired on them. It's backfired on them, and in the face of the public, it's backfiring because there are so many more critical issues that the Democrats and Republicans really need to be working on -- immigration, for one, health care, so many more issues that are important to the American people, education. But yet, they are focused on taking down Trump. And you said it earlier, it's like Trump derangement syndrome, right? They can't let it go. They just don't know where to go with it now. So here comes Mueller, we are going to see him next Wednesday, he is going to testify. I do not believe -- and even based really on the structure of the law, that he is going to go outside of his lane during this testimony and go outside of the report. But remember this, the Republicans can ask them lots of questions. And I'm going to tell you, there is going to be some surprises. I'm hearing from sources that they're going to be some questions -- HANNITY: Don't give too much away, because I know exactly where you're going. Go ahead. CARTER: I'm not. HANNITY: Now, I want to report to our audience. CARTER: I know, I know. I'm not going to give too much away. But definitely, the audience and the viewers need to be well aware that things are going to happen come next week. And I want to go really quickly, before you move on, to Christopher Steele. Look, this is a former MI6 spy from Great Britain, that is not trying to dig himself out of a hole and he's looking for every loophole to dig himself out of. I don't want to let him skate away. He knew when he turned that dossier in that it was garbage. The dossier is garbage. It's disinformation from Russians. And he didn't care. Why? Because he made it very clear to Bruce Ohr at the Department of Justice that he did not want President Trump or then candidate Trump to be elected. HANNITY: And the fact that they used his dossier, and they were warned on numerous occasions, one time in August 2016 by Bruce Ohr, that Steele had an agenda, he hated Trump, Hillary paid for it, and it's not verified. And it's now we know because in an interrogatory in Great Britain, as we have told this audience, he said he didn't know if any of it was true. Now I go to Tom Fitton. I suspect Sara is right, and that is that Mueller is going to stick to his script, which the script is the Mueller report. Gives low, long, meandering lessons -- answers to run out the clock, but the fertile ground is what the Republicans can ask him. When did you know there was no conspiracy? Why did you only pick Democratic donors? Why did you put that guy that was at -- with the worst, the most atrocious history of withholding exculpatory evidence, losing 9-0 in the Supreme Court, putting innocent people in jail -- why did you let him hire your entire staff, which we just learned today, because there is there's a group called the Judicial Watch, that actually got Andrew Weissmann's emails, if I'm correct -- Tom Fitton? TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: Yes, he was doing the hiring of these anti-Trumpers for Mr. Mueller. We also have the document showing that Steele was not only on a Clinton payroll, DNC payroll, but during the campaign -- HANNITY: FBI? FITTON: -- in 2016, he met with the FBI 13 times and he was paid 11 times. And I think the Democrats really don't care about anything we are saying. (ROSSTALK) HANNITY: -- for the same lies? FITTON: Oh, sure, and he was working for the Russians at the same time.. HANNITY: Four people, one book of lies, amazing job if you can get it. FITTON: But, you know, quickly, the Democrats recognize there are issues potentially with Mueller's testimony. They're trying to protect themselves by limiting, breaking the rules of Congress to get Trump again, not only with subpoenas, but destroying the rights of members themselves. But they are still focus is doing whatever it is they can get do within their powers and without their powers by harassing subpoenas to target Trump. It's about getting Trump. So, you are right. There's a risk in doing this. They don't care because they think they will be protected by their colleagues in the media and they are going to try to get anything they can out of Mueller. They are going to continue to harass the president, not only with subpoenas targeting his presidency improperly, but himself, personally. So, you've got this personal and presidential harassment unprecedented by Congress with these subpoenas -- HANNITY: Well, that's why -- FITTON: -- asking for core White House officials to come in. They know they'll never testify. HANNITY: OK. FITTON: But they'll have to spend a lot of lawyer money having to deal with it. (CROSSTALK) FITTON: It's really an abuse of power. HANNITY: I'm saying enough. They should just say no. JARRETT: Harassment, absolutely. HANNITY: Here's what I want to ask you, though. It's presidential harassment. Also, who can afford these lawyers talking to this congress committee, this congressional committee, this Senate committee, this they're all told -- they're all cooperating? JARRETT: You invoke executive privilege, and if you are forced to testify, invoke the Fifth Amendment. HANNITY: They can't stop you if you testify, all right. JARRETT: If you testify that the earth is round, its perjury trap, and they'll accuse you of lying. Don't do it. HANNITY: Let me ask you about Weissmann. This revelation is huge. JARRETT: Yes. HANNITY: This is a guy that lost tens of thousands of jobs, was beaten in Supreme Court, 9-0, great job, Weissmann. Was at Hillary Clinton's victory party, did all the hiring for Mueller. Mueller's now -- he's on -- you know, one position, the other position, back to the old position. FITTON: And now, he has a book deal. HANNITY: And Weissmann now -- he can write all the books he wants. JARRETT: It underscores the malevolence of Bob Mueller and hiring a team of partisans led by that guy on your screen. This is a guy who has a long history of getting caught threatening witnesses and hiding evidence. HANNITY: \"Licensed to Lie\". JARRETT: Yes, \"Licensed to Lie,\" Sidney Powell's great book about it, discloses all of his offenses. And yet Mueller knew this and wanted him to be his chief lead prosecutor. I've written a new book. It's coming out in a couple of months, and it discloses some astonishing stories about Weissmann. HANNITY: All right, thank you all. By the way, tomorrow night, we will bring up all the questions we want Bob Mueller asked. I'm excited. I'm actually happy he's going to testify. That surprised you? I want you tune in tomorrow night. Coming up, civil war brewing in the Democratic Party. Oh, it is out of control. Yes, the real speaker, Ocasio-Cortez, and speaker in name only Pelosi's public feud has now gone to new heights. Senator Lindsey Graham is here. And later, at the end of the show, I have the best video you've seen in your life, out of control. And I have an offer for Congresswoman Ocasio- Cortez, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Tonight, no denying it, Democrats are in an all-out civil war. Congresswoman -- I think the real speaker of the House -- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez challenging Nancy Pelosi's gavel and showing no signs of backing down at all. Remember, yesterday, there was a meeting. And Speaker Pelosi said, if you have something to say to me, say it to my face, don't have to say it on Twitter. Well, the freshman congresswoman, there it is, suggested the speaker in name only singled out women of color, excuse me, and Pelosi asked about the feud earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: I said what I'm going to say in the caucus. They took offense because I addressed -- at the request of my members, an offensive tweet that came out of one of the members' offices, that referenced our Blue Dogs and our new Dems, essentially as a segregationist. I addressed that. How they are interpreting and carrying it to another place is up to them, but I'm not going to be discussing it any further. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And it's getting even nastier because according to \"The Hill,\" House Democrat William Lacy Clay is taking sides, saying, quote: What a weak argument, because you can get your way because you're getting pushed back, you resort to using the race card? Woo. Before adding, quote: I agree with the speaker. Four people, four votes out of 240 people. Who cares? This Democratic circular firing squad is also forcing the media mob. They love their Democrats. They are the spokespeople for the Democrats. You have MSDNC, you've got fake news CNN, you've got three networks, \"New York Times,\" \"Washington Post\", now, the media mob is taking sides. Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She's taking some real risk in pushing them away so aggressively. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To me, I really think it goes back to the optics. You have an older white woman frankly who is very powerful, who understands how her caucus runs, but they're going up against four women of color who are young who looked like a Democratic base. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Democrats, we have to get rid of this guy, and this type of infighting is not helping. I don't know about going to race right away. It's like, really, that's where you go right away? I thought that that was a bit much, frankly. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People who are here now, all you young people, you're on the shoulders of a whole bunch of people who came before you. Did you sit these moderates down and say, listen, we've got to put this together? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's true. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And if you're not going to do that, you aren't allowed to (EXPLETIVE DELETED) about this. If you want to move it, then let's get it moved. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: All right. Joining us now with the reaction, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is with us. You know, Senator, why would I ever get in the midst of a fight like that? Interesting squabble. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: Right. HANNITY: But you can see -- think about this, Speaker Pelosi pulled everyone together, you have something to say to me, say it to my face, not on Twitter. GRAHAM: Right. HANNITY: Now, you've got to give Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez credit. She went right out and slugged right back. And I'm like, good for her, a lot of courage. GRAHAM: So, what does this really mean? I think Republicans are more likely to take the House back because of this breakdown, because there are 31 Democrats that hold congressional seats where President Trump won their congressional district. What does it mean to these 31? If you cross a AOC and the Fab 4, you're going to get a primary, and if you vote with them you're going to lose in the general election. So the biggest beneficiary of this will be the Republican Party and President Trump, because the policies these four people are pushing or so out of the mainstream. But if you're one of these 31 Democrats, Sean, you got to pick between the energy of the Fab 4 and the practicality of Nancy Pelosi, you're in a no- win situation. HANNITY: Maybe, I've only been in politics 30 years, on radio 30 years. We've been here in the Fox News. I'm like the old person here at Fox. I've been here from the beginning. And you could even see it in my hair every night. You know, so here's what I'm thinking. So the modern Democratic Party - let's see, they want open borders, take down the walls. Walls are now immoral. They weren't when Obama was a President. Then they want free health care and you could have no other choice - Medicare for all. Then they want higher taxes. Then all these 2020 candidates support the Green New Deal. Everything's free everything. And by the way no oil, gas, the lifeblood of our economy, no combustion engine and eventually no cows and planes. Why am I thinking that if I'm Donald Trump, I'm a happy guy tonight? GRAHAM: If I'm President Trump, I'd go to Florida and show up next November and get reelected. HANNITY: Is that all its going to take. GRAHAM: Literally. Mr. President if you're watching tonight, just enjoy this. Be quiet. Because here's what there saying, they're going to decriminalize crossing the border illegally. And once you get here they'll give you free health care. How many people in the world, do you think, will take us up on the offer, come to America there's no more criminal liability and when you get here we will give you free health care. This is insane. You know it's insane. HANNITY: But then you got this whole other side. And somebody wanted me to ask you a question and so I will ask it-- GRAHAM: OK. HANNITY: --which is they're obsessed with a fifth and sixth investigation. FBI concluded, House Intel concluded, Bipartisan Senate Committee and the Mueller report, no conspiracy no collusion. OK. That means there's no underlying crime, unlike Hillary underlying crime, real obstruction, subpoenaed emails, BleachBit all that. All right, so here's my question. So you now have the ability - they don't have solutions for America. You're going to run against that-- GRAHAM: Right. HANNITY: But you have the ability to bring in people like Andrew Weissmann, who we learned today, was responsible for hiring all the Clinton donors, even Clinton's attorney for Robert Mueller. Are you going to do that? GRAHAM: I'm going to let Horowitz do his job to tell us what happened with the FISA warrant process. Then I'm not going to get in Durham's way who's looking at putting people in jail. But I am going to explain to the American people that everybody that was investigating Trump hated his guts and liked Clinton. I'm going to help tell that story. But I'm not going to do anything until Horowitz issues his report. But we will try to lay out the facts of the case and make sure in the future if you apply for a FISA warrant you have to tell the court, \"By the way the chief informant here hates the person they're looking at --\" HANNITY: It's not verified. GRAHAM: --it's not verified. So I'll do that but. Here's what I want you to understand. The Democratic Party is imploding, that's bad for America. Their immigration policies are no more - criminal liability if you come to the country illegally. You get free health care. We're going to abolish ICE. And it even if you go to court and lose, you still can't be deported. Now that's insane. HANNITY: And by the way, I've been down to the border, I think, now 14 times. GRAHAM: I'm going tomorrow. HANNITY: You're going to the border? GRAHAM: Tomorrow - tomorrow. HANNITY: Well come back tomorrow we'll update everybody. GRAHAM: All right. Thanks. HANNITY: All right, Senator Graham, good to see you. Thank you. When we come back, really disturbing details about the Jeffrey Epstein case are beginning to trickle out. Jonathan Hunt, he has a full report. We'll also get reaction, Dan Bongino, Geraldo Rivera about Epstein's ties to the Democrats and Americas mayor. Straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. So as the Jeffrey Epstein case continues to unfold, new and very disturbing details continue to emerge about who he is, how he lived. What kind of dubious activities he was involved in. Relay the shocking details live from our West Coast Newsroom tonight, our own Jonathan Hunt. How many times did Bill Clinton hang out with this guy, just a question? JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: That's a good question that will be answered in due time, I'm sure Sean. And given the horrifying nature of the allegations against Jeffrey Epstein, it is perhaps not surprising that some strange alleged details are emerging about his lifestyle. Here are some reported by other news outlets, unconfirmed by Fox News. New York Magazine reports, for instance, he had a human-sized chessboard in his New York City mansion with scantily-clad figurines modeled after his employees. The New York Times reports he had a mural in the same mansion showing him standing in the center of a prison yard, a premonition perhaps? The source of his wealth is largely unknown. Although, Bloomberg reports Epstein once ran a money management firm for the very rich. And The Associated Press reports that a man who runs boat charters near Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, said that everybody called Epstein's \"Pedophile Island\". There will doubtless be many more salacious details to emerge in the case of Mr. Epstein, who, as has been well documented, has previously been friendly with Presidents Clinton and Trump. Sean. HANNITY: Jon, well, what they don't say about Trump - thank you, Jonathan in our West Coast Newsroom tonight. They don't say, oh, Donald Trump threw his ass out of Mar-a-Lago years ago, because of his behavior. They kind of forget that key detail. I wonder if he had something on Trump if he'd act this way. But a number of prominent Democratic politicians on long-running ties to Epstein and by the way are expected to be ensnared in the growing sand scandal. By the way, Chuck Schumer, he got thousands of dollars in donations from the convicted sex offender. Now the Senator is coming out, he's going to donate to contributors - donate the contributions. Anyway, here now is Fox News Correspondent At-Large, Geraldo Rivera; Fox News Contributor, former Secret Service Agent Dan Bongino. So I've covered this story little while back. Now the media in 2016 - they didn't want to go near this story, because as the New York Post says, the \"Lolita Express\" and \"Orgy Island\" - I didn't make those names up. They say, and it's been reported, and I haven't confirmed. So I'm just saying what's been reported that I've not confirmed. Bill Clinton was pretty friendly with this guy. The same Bill Clinton that messed around with the intern in the White House - a pretty young girl at the time, right, Geraldo, that you were defending every-- GERALDO RIVERA, CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: I don't recall that. HANNITY: Oh, I think you'll recall it. I think you broke a big story on \"Rivera Live\" at the time. RIVERA: I think that Epstein will be revealed as an equal opportunity bipartisan sleazebag when all is said and done. I think, Sean, the most shocking thing is, how prosecutors in Florida and New York dropped the ball heretofore. If it wasn't for the Miami Herald and the renewed interest in this case, he would have gone basically scot-free after serving that ridiculously lenient sentence. HANNITY: But wait, what about - Pam Bondi said those last night that she's prosecuted these sex cases and pedophile cases in the past. She said one of the hardest things is the victims don't want to testify. And by the way think about it, if they do they're going to sit there and be cross-examined and have to relive the horror, the evil of something like that? RIVERA: The evil, though, and I think that it's important to remember this as parents, and parents of daughters. The evil was that he set his sights on the most vulnerable young girls - 14, 15 years old. If he had just used his billions to lavish - indulge himself with hookers, I would not be morally outraged. The fact is that he-- HANNITY: Wouldn't be an issue today. RIVERA: --wouldn't be an issue. HANNITY: But, I read the Daily Mail article, Dan Bongino, I was 14 and I had braces. I'm like that's evil. That is robbing some child of their soul. And that's why this matters. DAN BONGINO, CONTRIBUTOR: No, this story is really beyond grotesque, I mean, when you read the details. I mean, you don't need to be a parent. Being a parent it makes it even worse. But any sane sentient being these details is completely horrified. But Sean, one of the things about this case, so it's really bothersome is. Yes, they - Geraldo is right, there's been some decent journalism on it. But some of its misplaced this criticism of Acosta - Trump's cabinet secretary, Alexander Acosta, yes. Was the case prosecuted well? No, I think we can all agree on that. Was the sentence lenient? Obviously, at this point. But I don't think people understand, the federal system Acosta was working in, as they attorney - yes - United States Attorney for Southern District of Florida, doesn't work like the state system. There is no specific federal sex crime charge that works like a state charge. He's was dealt a really rough hand. HANNITY: I got to be honest, god forbid this happens to a kid, how do you ask them to relive that? And that has to be part of the evidence. I would be torn. RIVERA: They had a 53 count federal indictment drafted against this guy and Acosta did not pursue it. He chose to step aside and let the state prosecutors handle it, because he says, he wanted to ensure that Epstein-- HANNITY: --what about the grand jury in that case? RIVERA: I think you should had. I mean, the-- HANNITY: But the grand jury said no locally. RIVERA: I believe that Epstein seduced everyone from politicians to prosecutors with this fabulous wealth. HANNITY: Sad. RIVERA: Sad, sickening. HANNITY: You touch a kid, its evil. If, by the way, even the worst hardened criminals, you know this-- RIVERA: Absolutely. HANNITY: They can't stand those people. BONGINO: And Sean, can I make one last point? HANNITY: Real quick. BONGINO: This was a - if a State case, they would have put this guy away for a very, very long time. Federally, it was not a great case for federal court system-- HANNITY: But the Southern District of New York is the best. Let's see what happens. BONGINO: Yes, they are. But they are limited by-- HANNITY: All right. We got to run. When we come back, remember the former Trump campaign staffer who said Trump kissed her on the lips, we got the video. It totally exonerates the President. Rudy Giuliani reacts to President's attorney, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Back in February staffer from President Trump's campaign filed a law suit alleging that President Trump forcibly kissed her on the mouth in 2016. And last month the judge tossed the lawsuit and yesterday, lawyers for the President, they released the video foreign the alleged incident and it's even slowed down so you don't miss a thing, which appears about as exculpatory as they could be exonerating the President. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALVA JOHNSON, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN STAFFER: Oh, thank you. It was-- DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: Thank you, a pleasure. (CROSSTALK) (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Look at the slowed version of the video. It shows the President didn't kiss the women on her lips. That was a friendly goodbye and nothing. (VIDEO PLAYING) HANNITY: Look at that, there you go. Hello, thank you. Good bye. And she seemed OK too. Wow, these are the types of lawsuits, because of what, Trump psychosis, rage? Anyway, guess who is back in the news? Rosie O'Donnell. When will there be a low where people say enough is enough? In an interview the Hollywood liberal takes this shot at the president's daughter, as if this family hasn't get shot at like every other day in even worse ways. This is pretty low even for Rosie O'Donnell. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHELANGELO SIGNORILE, HOST, SIRIUS XM RADIO: Talk a little bit about Ivanka Trump and what Donald Trump is doing with her? ROSIE O'DONNELL, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: I don't know what he's doing with her. I think he's-- SIGNORILE: Well, I mean, politically. O'DONNELL: --been doing bad things with her for a very long time. There's a creepy incest feel that is very prevalent amongst Donald Trump and his children - at least his daughter - very creepy. I don't know. I think she's like, you know, a talentless, non-intelligent, non-powerful woman. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: You would know a talentless, non-intelligent person, Rosie, really well. That's even low for you. Joining us now President Trump's Attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Mayor, I'll dismiss Rosie as being the extremists she is. But here you are, here's the President having a great time, saying goodbye to somebody. A kiss on the cheek - you slow it down, it's still a kiss on the cheek. I'll re-rack it and show it. And this is - this is every second, every minute, every hour of every day attack the President. RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: Yes, I know. And lucky we have the footage, because some people would just believe it. And I think it's because the media - a lot of the media has created this hysteria about the President. I mean, the whole Mueller investigation was infused with that. It's investigation never should have happened. They printed the wildest, craziest lives, and of course they had never apologized for it. So I think people feel empowered to say anything they want. I mean, something like that should have serious sanctions, so it doesn't happen again. HANNITY: You know, Mr. Mayor, I know you're in Albanian tonight and I know you're there for a particular reason which is a 100 years of freedom, but - with the Iranian resistance. But here's what I want to ask you. So we know where the economy stands Obama-Biden versus President Trump - best employment situation since 1969, records for every demographic group. But on the issue, look at everybody's foreign policy positions, especially Biden - $150 billion on the tarmac in cash and other currencies for the mullahs of Iran. I'm having a hard time ever understanding bribing dictators that say and chant death to America. GIULIANI: Well, you know, one of the problems here - I mean, people died as a result of it, was Obama sent Biden to negotiate the Status of Forces Agreement in Iraq. Of course, as he did every time he dealt with foreign policy, he failed miserably. We pulled all our troops out and 120 of these people were killed by the Iranians. And it took Herculean efforts by this organization, me, (inaudible) Michael Mukasey, a number of others to get these people finally brought to Albania so we could fulfill the promise we made to them to protect them. They were abandoned by Obama, abandoned by Biden, and they are our allies. This is the epicenter of the Iranian resistance. Where I'm sitting right now, they broadcast 24 hours a day into Iran, like they're the voice of America. They was shunned by the Obama administration. The Obama administration went so far that some of these people were killed and luckily with this administration, he supports the resistance movement - the President, does and the administration does and the killing has stopped and a lot of protests are going on inside of Iran. And this is a great alternative to that horrible regime in Iran. HANNITY: We could overturn that regime, be better for the entire world. They foment terror. They fight proxy wars and they have a 150 billion extra dollars because of Biden-Obama. Mr. Mayor enjoy your conference. Thank you for being with us. We appreciate it. When we come back, all right this video is off the hook insane - absolutely nuts. You probably have never seen anything like it. A man losing it completely. All caught on tape. Plus, I have a special offer that I will be making it to Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, that's straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. \"Our Villain of the Day\", well, he let his old temper gets out of control. This is in insane. Bagel shop, Long Island, New York, because an employee at the store smiled at him. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why is it OK for women to say, \"Oh you're 5 feet' on dating sites you should be dead. That's OK?\" UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who said that you here? Nobody. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Women in general had said it on dating sites. You think I'm making that (bleep) up. Everywhere I go, I get the same (bleep) smirk with the biting lip. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Clam down. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shut your mouth. You're not god or my father or my boss. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dude. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dude, you want to step outside? Huh? I'm not scared of you pal. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Enough, enough. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You shut up (bleep) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go ahead and attack me. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I just (bleep). (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Well, the guy did bump the other guy. Oh, boy, in the end, no injuries, no charges. Man left with an egg and cheese bagel. All right. We hope he gets anger management counseling. All right, before we go tonight - all right, I'm going to extend tonight an offer to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I know she watches. On Twitter she Tweets about the show. I want to give you an hour invitation to come on the show to have a discussion. And by the way I will invite you on my radio show, 618 is the best talk radio shows in America. I will give you three hours there. You get a lot of criticism on this program. We'll talk, we'll have a conversation. I hope you will join us. Well, we'll never be the destroy-Trump media mob. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham, I think that's a good offer, wouldn't you take it? Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2019 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

I'm Jesse Watters along with Dan Bongino, Capri Cafaro, Dagen McDowell, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \u201cThe Five.\u201d Are you ready for witch hunt 2.0? Get ready, because that's what the Democrats are gearing up for. After Mueller's testimony failed to deliver the knockout blow to Trump's presidency that they promised, Nancy Pelosi and her pals are now revealing their new plans to go after Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are filing an application for the grand jury material underlying the Mueller report. We will continue to seek testimony and key-fact witnesses and to investigate the president's misconduct. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And it was clear to me, anyway, yesterday, he did not follow the money, so someone needs to do the investigation into money laundering. We're having a vigorous debate about whether we need to go beyond investigation to impeachment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That we were simply trying to run out the clock on impeachment -- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I'm not trying to run out the clock. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: And just moments ago from the oval office, President Trump was fired up and sounding off on the Democrats' endless investigations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I think it's a disgrace what the Democrats are doing. All they want to do is impede. They want to investigate. They want to go fishing. And I watch Bob Mueller and they have nothing. These people are clowns. The Democrats are clowns. They're being laugh at all over the world. And I watch this morning, I watch Nancy Pelosi trying to get through that with the performance that Robert Mueller put on where I don't think he ever read the agreement or the document. And the document said no collusion. They don't even talk about that. So there was no crime. They said, well, there was no crime, but he obstructed. How do you obstruct if there's no crime? But, actually, it was worse than that because it was a phony crime that they put on. The crime was what they put on. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Clowns, Greg. GREG GUTFELD, HOST: Yeah. WATTERS: People are clowns. GUTFELD: They're clowns. Well, what else can you call them? I mean, you look at the media right now, they expect it. They're like let's make a deal and they expected a shiny corvette behind door number one. And when the curtain pulled back it was an inflatable doll. Nothing there for them. And also -- then you hear them saying, some of the media are saying, oh, it's a mixed bag, right? It's a mixed bad. Yes, it's a mixed bag of dog poop, cat poop, and horse poop. They can't take -- as you say, Dan, they can take the L. What this was a great week for were normal people, meaning people not prone to hysterics or emotional vendettas. That you can watch this with a detached -- as a detached observer, OK? This could go one way or the other. But your whole life isn't hanging on it the way it does with Morning Joe. They're having public nervous breakdowns over this. If they went the other way, we would just get on with our life. We'd go have dinner. We feel bad one way or the other because we support the president. We don't want -- you know, we don't want their hysteria to be proven true. But now you see the Dems and the media redoubling their efforts after this failure. They're redoubling their efforts for impeachment. So imagine if the hearing was good for them, what would they have done? If it's bad for them, this is what they're doing. Imagine if it was good for them, what would they've done? WATTERS: I don't know. I don't know. GUTFELD: They would have had torches and tar and feathers. WATTERS: That's right. It would have been pitchforks at 1600, Dan. They tried to frame him, they failed. They tried to investigate him, they failed. I mean, what else can they do? DAN BONGINO, HOST: Guys, ladies, have some dignity. Please, isn't this embarrassing? Greg, they're throwing stuff at the wall right now, OK? First it was collusion, and that was a hoax. Then it was obstruction, and now it's money laundering. Next it will be felonious mopery (INAUDIBLE) piracy on the open sea. WATTERS: Piracy. BONGINO: Jaywalking after -- aggravated jaywalking. Listen, we're not supposed to say anything we've talked about in the green room. They say, don't do it. I'm doing it. I said to Greg, can you take the L? You lost. Like, remember after read my lips, the speech, every Republican years later acknowledge, big loss, shouldn't have said read my lips and raise taxes. The Democrats -- listen, I'm giving you free political advice, OK? Believe me, I know what it's like. I lost when I ran for office. Take the L, the case is over. He's right, you look like -- GUTFELD: I don't think you should have accepted that loss. (LAUGHTER) BONGINO: I want a recount. (CROSSTALK) CAPRI CAFARO, HOST: There's -- hanging chad's and dimpled chads and everything else down there. Look, I'll chime it on getting some free political advice as the Dem here at the table this Friday afternoon. I have been saying this until I'm blue in the face. The American people have investigation fatigue, and when the Democrats go down this path where they will not give up and they're focused more on trying to get at the president than on important policy issues that actually help them win the midterm elections, we set ourselves up to be the greatest adversary for Trump, because we're playing into his hand. We're saying, you know, look, we all have Trump derangement syndrome and he's gonna say, see, see, see, and that distract from the bigger thing. But, unfortunately, some Democrats that have not gotten the memo, if they don't get it soon, the clock is ticking and we're going to be in not a great position to take on Trump in just a few months in the general election. WATTERS: And, Dagen, they have so many committees in the House. I mean, a thousand committees, and this is just one oversight committee or intel committee, and that's all the media is focused on. It's all the Democrats are focused on. They can't walk and chew gum at the same time. They can't do infrastructure, drug prices, health care, asylum, can't do anything except this. DAGEN MCDOWELL, HOST: The problem with the Democrats is they only talk and listen to other people who wear make up for a living. No offense, Jesse. Or anybody -- WATTERS: I have only a little blush. MCDOWELL: Only at this table. But one thing -- he's talking about regular folks. And that's one thing that the Democrats and people on other networks don't understand is Trump's ability to talk to regular folks in this country. And when he's mad and he's ranting and raving, well, you know what, people at home would be too. I'd hold a grudge. I will hold a grudge if somebody went after me and tried to destroy me. I would be chafed, chapped, and white-hot mad about it, then followed by all this snot-nosed brats who have hated Trump his whole life and always wanted to take him down. I would be as furious as he is. And you know what? This ferocity has worked for him. The percentage of people who oppose impeachment has continued to go up in the last year. It's almost -- what? Two-thirds people in this country survey. And the percentage in favor of impeachment has gone down. So, again -- CAFARO: That's why Pelosi is actually trying to slow walk it no matter what she says. WATTERS: Well, I wonder what the president could have accomplish if he didn't have this entire two-year investigation and the Russia cloud holding over his head, because he had a poll come out, ABC News-Washington Post had him at 40 percent -- 47 percent. That is his all-time high in that poll. That was before the Mueller hearing. The Fox News poll that just came out, Dan, had a approval for the economy at decade high. This is pretty good stuff right now. And now he's gonna come into a recess where everybody goes home. I think he will look even better. BONGINO: And this was a heavy anchor around his neck. But what's ironic about this entire thing too is it's boomerang on the Democrats, and they have no capacity here for self-reflection. I think it was David Gergen on the other network, nobody watches outside the airport, he said something to the effect -- passively watching it, that's what they call it. He said, listen, you know, we're not really open to the Republicans arguments here. And they've been studying this case for a long time. And I think that's why we're unprepared. Everybody over there at the airport was shocked. Oh, my gosh. Maybe he's right? Like, we have to withstand these attacks about this hoax forever, so people at this table have done the homework, understand what it's about, and as you look into it, it's all about the Democrats and Russia and not -- WATTERS: I think that was the first time in the country, outside of Fox News, Greg. Maybe actually heard Joseph -- name mentioned, Fusion GPS's name, Glenn Simpson's name, the dossier, they've never heard that, and I don't think it's been covered by these hard news networks. GUTFELD: I mean, it's more about, I guess, British collusion, isn't it, than Russian? I think it's a good question of the media, the credibility of this endeavor is gone. So maybe there's a Pulitzer there to investigate this investigation, because how do -- you know, how do this move forward? How do people not see this coming? Or did they know that Mueller was not engaged in this investigation and we're happy that he wasn't engaged because they were doing other things. That would make a great story for maybe, you know, a network. WATTERS: I think that's the point because a lot of people had said he had no idea what was going on in the investigation, and it was run by Clinton donors and Clinton lawyers. So you have to think for yourself, he's being investigated by his political opponent. This is not the nonpartisan investigation that the American people were told it was. CAFARO: Well, again, I think this was the risk the Democrats took when they decided to go down this road and put all their eggs in this basket and call Mueller to testify in front of these committees because one of two things is going to happen. You know, if he did not explicitly say, yes, I would have charged him with a crime which kind of said but didn't say, you know, they're going to lose. And so, when it comes out that Mueller wasn't as engaged in this process when he didn't answer so many of the questions, say I'm not going to get into this, I'm not going to get into this, I'm not going to get into this, it really hurt the Democrats for putting all their eggs in this basket, which is why you go back to the point -- MCDOWELL: You know who would never called Bob Mueller to testify if he was on those side? Donald Trump. Because, again, he might have done a little- bit of research to figure out that the guy shouldn't be sitting in front of the public. But, again, these Democrats all talk to themselves and they go, yeah, you're doing such a great job. This is going to be a win. WATTERS: All right. And now the investigators are going to be investigated. And for the first time the White House goes on offense with regards to these probes. All right, we'll follow it. Up next, is Nancy Pelosi now sucking up to AOC after their meeting today? We'll show you the video next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BONGINO: After weeks of tensions that caused a major divide in the Democratic Party, Nancy Pelosi and far-left socialist Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez finally met face-to-face today. Pelosi, apparently, rolled out the red carpet and tried playing nice with the squad leader. But, remember, AOC basically accused Pelosi of being a racist, claiming she was singling out women of color. Despite all that, Pelosi says they don't have any differences. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think you were able to bury the hatchet (INAUDIBLE). REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., HOUSE SPEAKER: I don't think there ever was any hatchet. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE). PELOSI: We're in a political arena. And so, and I'll call this -- we have our differences. Respect that. We have a good meeting, and the congresswoman is a very gracious member of Congress, so we had a very positive conversation. (END VIDEO CLIP) BONGINO: And here's AOC reacting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: It was a positive meeting, and productive. I think the Speaker respects, you know, the fact that we're coming together as a party and that unity. And I'm looking forward to us getting back this summer. (END VIDEO CLIP) BONGINO: All right, Capri, I'll go to you first as the resident Democrat on the panel today. You know, we have inside, outside power in D.C., right? Everybody has heard that to me, inside power you can move legislation, outside power with the activist group. I think AOC and the squad's power on both sides is being dramatically overestimated. Zero votes on the green new deal. She hasn't been able to move anything with significance. She has had a good twitter game, am I reading this wrong? CAFARO: I don't think -- I think there's two things. I mean, number one, the inside game is not existent for the quote, unquote, squad, because they are unable to actually move legislation or impact anything that has to do with substantive dialogue inside of Congress. So there's that. Their outside game I think is limited. I think that they have a strong outside game amongst activist groups, but not in the, you know -- dash not in the party writ-large, and certainly not in the American public at large. So I think there's the difference there. One thing that I do want to caution about AOC and the inside/outside game in the squad, if she talked about unity, and unity is incredibly important if we actually want to win. Even Al Sharpton said this, like, yo, we've got to focus on that. Put our eyes on the prize. WATTERS: Yo. CAFARO: Guess what? Oh, no, I said guess what. This is the guess what seat. So here's the thing though, I saw this play out in 2016 with the progressives. They care more about advancing the progressive agenda than the Democrats winning. They basically said Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are the same, good. I hope the Democrats lose their lesson. So I hope and pray that the progressives understand that unity means victory, but if, you know, past is prologue, I'm not so sure. BONGINO: But, Jesse, the progressive agenda is a big loser. Nobody wants this. You cannot sell the American people 90 percent tax rates, you know, getting rid of gassy cows -- what is it? Tunnels underneath the Atlantic Ocean, whatever she wants -- WATTERS: Don't forget the Hawaiian -- or forget the London -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Listen, Nancy knows that, but AOC doesn't know that. So that's why they had the meeting. And you're right, this is all about unity, because what was the message afterwards? Both of them said the same thing. This is about coming together, unity, and being positive. Because right now Nancy knows that the more divided the Democrats are, the better it is for Donald Trump. The more divided they are in Congress, the worse it is for the Democrat presidential candidate. So, I bet Nancy probably read her the riot act and said you better shut the -- up, or we're going to lose another presidential election. Because right now, all the media is doing is covering our infighting, covering your squad gaps, and you're giving a tremendous amount of fodder to the President of the United States president. He's just using you to raise money and fire up his base. So cut it out and let's get on the same team. BONGINO: You know, Dagen, you think they would have learned from the tea party, which at the time I consider myself a member of. I still align with a lot of the values they believe in. But I think it's clear to anyone looking at it through a clear eye history now that the infighting with the Republicans was (INAUDIBLE). The Democrats had beat us back. You think the Democrats would learn from that. It doesn't seem like they are. MCDOWELL: Oh, Nancy Pelosi knows. She's playing the long game here. She's also watched all about it eves several times, and she knows she's Margo Channing. AOC is Eve Harrington. Margo Channing wins. These women, these young women, they're children. They're driven by instant gratification. And how many likes and retweets and viral videos they can come up with. They care more about what a stranger thinks about some video. They care more about what a stranger who can't even vote for them, who lives overseas thinks, than people who actually live in this country. WATTERS: Nancy is thinking about 2020, 2022, 2024, I mean, she's thinking in midterms, and AOC is thinking about the weekend. CAFARO: Can we give AOC a small Pelosi -- BONGINO: You know, Greg, I'm no fan of Nancy Pelosi, but, you know, we have to be straight at the table, she's been around a long time. You don't want her on your bad side if you've got D in front of your name. GUTFELD: Yeah, you know, I do think though this -- two points. One, this is a win for AOC. Her status rises by meeting with Nancy Pelosi alone. WATTERS: Right. GUTFELD: She didn't meet with the other three. She just became Beyonce leaving Destiny's Child. She's -- remember I said Phil Collins leaving Genesis, remember? A couple of days ago. Anyway, so that helps her, but this really is a clash of mindsets. And Pelosi believes you can work with anyone you disagree with because that's life. We always deal with people we disagree with, and you move forward, you make compromises. AOC is part of the new guard in which you believe the other side isn't just wrong, but evil. And you can't work with somebody you consider to be immoral or a Nazi -- what do you call somebody a concentration camp guard? You really can't debate with them after that because you'll look like a hypocrite. So I would defend Nancy Pelosi and that she's part of the old ideology, except for one problem, she allowed the new ideology to fester in her own party. It should have been beaten back this idea of demonization. Demonizing people, calling them racist, calling them sexist, calling them homophobes, in which what you end up having is a decline in dialogue across the country. WATTERS: Right. And now they can't do anything bipartisan. GUTFELD: Yeah. BONGINO: All right, got to go. Even more videos emerging of cops getting -- getting assaulted across the country. Don't go anywhere, folks. It's not just New York (INAUDIBLE), next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAFARO: In the wake of a string of disturbing water bucket attacks on New York city police, a fourth video has emerged, this time showing little kids shooting water guns at officers. One of them -- one of the NYPD unions is now saying enough is enough and is demanding that the city's police commissioner resign. And while there is a growing outrage over what's being called a total lack of respect towards law enforcement, a shocking video from last month is now getting attention. This one shows cops in Atlanta being blasted by super soakers from a large crowd surrounding them. All right, I know this issue has really fired a lot of people up, particularly you. You're somebody in law enforcement. I want to go to you first and hear what you have to say. We know that sometimes community and the police force don't always get along, but is this really the answer? BONGINO: You know, I'll never forget my last day before I left the NYPD to become a secret service agent. There's one thing on the precinct and it's because we lost one of our guys, a guy who had worked his entire career for probably $50,000. I mean, he wasn't going to be poor, but he sure as hell never going to be rich. I knew the guy, came there every day, he busted his butt, and we had a general idea back then that even though we knew were going to have casualties -- the police, we'll always going to have each other's back. And there was this -- even in New York City, the NYPD where I work, there was this top-down mentality in the Giuliani era that it's not us versus them, we work for the community, but we are not going to be crapped on either. That is gone. De Blasio is a coward. The key of de Blasio -- CAFARO: Tell us what you really feel. BONGINO: This guy is a chump. He sits there on his throne on his ass. He doesn't do anything. He craps on the cops at any single opportunity. He blames them and tell his kids they need special rules dealing with the police officers, which is bull -- you get the rest of it. This guy -- this is your fault, de Blasio. You have never backed up the cops. Now these poor cops who go there, they lose their buddies, there are empty seats at Thanksgiving every year because we lose cops. Kids have lost their fathers, and you never back them up. It's this guy's fault and the Giuliani -- one more thing. I'm sorry. I don't want to hog the segment, we've got a lot of voices here. But in the Giuliani era, here was the rule. You threw a damn rock, you went to jail. The second guy who threw a rock, went to jail. I promise you, there was no third guy throwing a rock. This is -- you get the rest of it. CAFARO: You -- no, look, Dan, and you have every right to be fired up about this. And I was going to make a little bit of light saying, yeah, apparently you're going to be running Bill de Blasio's presidential campaign, but I won't go there quite yet. But, you know, you mentioned the issues of rocks. This is supposed to be something that was going to be a nonviolent protest, but obviously it's not. I mean, Dagen, what do you make of this? I mean, you know, when people are saying that they're picking up squirt guns rather than real guns as some kind of a solution. MCDOWELL: People watch these videos and know whether they live here in New York City or anywhere in this country, if the police officers can't and won't defend themselves even against water attacks, they can't defend the people and protect the people of the city in which they work. Mayor de Blasio, what did he say? Crime has gone down year after year after year, that's in spite of him. That's because of the police officers. That's because of the NYPD. And he's lucky, because he failed in every other way in this city whether it's protecting kids, the homeless, the mentally ill, students. The only reason that he's still in office is because the police department. This has to stop. All of these people need to go to jail. CAFARO: And Andy got lucky. Greg, my question to you is this, is this, you know, July's version of milk shaking people? I mean, we saw this across the pond and every place else where somehow, you know, people are rising up in the streets thinking that throwing milk shakes at people is somehow going to create, you know, civil discourse. Are you ready with the milk shake? GUTFELD: Yeah. I mean, humans are mimetic creatures, we imitate each other. So if we see the milk shakes, we see the water, and we also see it on social media. Mobs form fast because we tend to imitate each other. I think what we're seeing here, the lack of arrests is the consequence of smartphones cinema, because just one arrest when you have a mayor like de Blasio can be blown up as an example of brutality, and then you're going to have mass protests. And in a city with an MIA mayor who hates cops, let's face it, the police know that their career and their lives could be ruined, so just walk away. And so they're in a textbook definition of a tight spot. If they do the right thing, who knows what the mayor is gonna do to them next? They don't know what -- to you, Dan, I think that this is a different era -- like, you knew Giuliani was going to back you. But a cop there doesn't know that. So, they're like sitting there and going like you know what, arrest this kid for water or just go back with a soaked shirt and then they get ripped-- CAFARO: Look, here it seems like you know even in a time where everybody is divided, it seems like we're all united in something and this is - Bill de Blasio is not particularly for no reason, a big fan of Bill de Blasio including the President of the United States had a few choice words to say about his hometown mayor. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: Probably the worst mayor in the history of New York City. The Policemen and women cannot stand him. They don't respect him. They don't like him. I thought that was tragic watching that scene a couple of days ago when I first saw it, I couldn't believe it. I said, let me see that again. I don't believe what I'm seeing. And I know New York's finest and New York's finest like we were in touch with him today. They are devastated. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAFARO: Jesse what's your take. WATTERS: Well, yes, and de Blasio shot back today and said when Trump leaves office, he won't be welcome back in New York City. Well, I don't think that makes much sense because de Blasio will be out of office and Trump still owns his own tower. So, I don't think that's going to happen. I don't even like showing these videos because it's like the new ice bucket challenge. It goes viral. It's national. CAFARO: Much, much more-- WATTERS: Right, obviously and it encourages more people to do this because these teens on the street have found the perfect sweet spot to show their disrespect. They're not laying hands and they're not doing anything to interfere besides throw a little water and it doesn't trigger an aggressive response. But it shouldn't trigger aggressive response and they're afraid of responding aggressively because they're going to get called out on it. No one would ever do this five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago. There has been a complete lack of respect to authority figures in this country. ICE agents, teachers, parents police officers-- GUTFELD: Talk show host. CAFARO: Jesse-- WATTERS: Talk show hosts. CAFARO: I'm going to throw some water on you right now, because we're going to have to move on. MCDOWELL: Pavement dive. CAFARO: There you go. The Fastest 7 is coming up with a really creepy viral video that we debated all day of whether or not we're going to show you or not, but you know what don't go anywhere because you really will want to see it. Coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MCDOWELL: Welcome back. Time for the Fastest 7. First up, viewer warning. If you're squeamish and about to eat dinner this next video is gross. Not little gross, it's really gross. So, we'll give you a chance to cover your eyes. OK ready. Let's play it. (VIDEO PLAYING) The Internet is buzzing over that piece of raw chicken crawling and twitching its way off the table. Real or fake, Greg. GUTFELD: Well, obviously it's fake but it's also 5:37 PM on the East Coast. As our fans are busy making their dinner or their families, I question the reason behind showing this at that time and I now will be quiet. WATTERS: It's just so squeamish. This is making you sweat. GUTFELD: No, no. It doesn't make me sick. I just don't think you show that when people are having dinner. WATTERS: Because it makes you sick. GUTFELD: No, I just - I could - I'm saying there are people at home preparing dinner perhaps chicken and maybe they don't want to see something like that. WATTERS: I think this is a delicacy in some parts of the world. I don't see anything wrong with this people. You ever see Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom; they were eating much worse. GUTFELD: That was fiction. WATTERS: Wait, that was based on real dietary restrictions in certain parts of the world. CAFARO: Supposedly. WATTERS: These are nerve endings, there is twitching and - you know when you're falling a certain-- GUTFELD: You are out of your mind. CAFARO: No, that's what the article said. GUTFELD: It was from the Sun. It's a British tabloid. This did not happen. WATTERS: Impeachable video. GUTFELD: I live by the facts of the Sun. BONGINO: I'm not a food snob but I'm reasonably confident, Chicken tartar is not a thing. Shaken. There is no chicken tartar-- CAFARO: Unless you want E. coli. BONGINO: Tartar is a thing. Chicken tartar. GUTFELD: You will die. MCDOWELL: By the way it didn't come from Britain, where did it come from as the United States source of all the craziest stories, Florida. CAFARO: You know what they say. WATTERS: But there were chopsticks, so it was probably an Asian restaurant. CAFARO: Florida Man first. MCDOWELL: Before we move on, I'm just going to add that it is possible there is some there's a dish called a dancing squid and you put sodium on the muscles and there's some like an electrical response. WATTERS: I told you. GUTFELD: It happens to me. WATTERS: I told you. BONGINO: No thanks. GUTFELD: I do it in my hot tubs. BONGINO: I don't need the movement. I'll pass on the movement. Thank you. MCDOWELL: After that horrifying video maybe you're thinking it's time to go vegan, I'm a vegan. Well, you're in luck because Baskin Robbins is launching a plant-based ice cream. The company says it's trying to capitalize on the growing food trend. They provided the show with some of these vegan delicacies. WATTERS: Is this a taste test for turning vegan. MCDOWELL: They're all vegan. WATTERS: OK. All right. BONGINO: You've assured us production. GUTFELD: Yes, I am lactose intolerant. (CROSSTALK) BONGINO: If I'm not here for the next segment, folks-- GUTFELD: I'm lactose intolerant. CAFARO: Where are the happy cows. BONGINO: I can't even smell milk. WATTERS: I think it's pretty good. GUTFELD: Great. CAFARO: This is pretty good. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Some kind of prank, I will sue you. BONGINO: No, it doesn't at all. WATTERS: I kind of like it. GUTFELD: I will sue you. I will sue the hell out of you. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Me and Dan will sue, this network will have nothing when I'm done. BONGINO: I didn't even look at them. MCDOWELL: So, here's the problem. BONGINO: This is good. MCDOWELL: Because I'm just going to-- GUTFELD: This is fantastic. BONGINO: Good job. GUTFELD: Are you sure this is-- WATTERS: Is this really helping. GUTFELD: I don't believe this. MCDOWELL: No. WATTERS: Is it helping or not. (CROSSTALK) MCDOWELL: Well, it can be, I don't know about this, but broadly speaking vegan ice desserts like this they can be higher in fat and calories, so people eat them thinking that somehow, it's going to help them lose weight. BONGINO: Like the rice cake fad. Remember them. GUTFELD: You know what-- BONGINO: I have to do a segment-- GUTFELD: Do we know how much this is? Organic stuff is always more expensive. MCDOWELL: Yes. CAFARO: Also, there are no Baskin Robbins hardly any place-- GUTFELD: My wife got me organic shaving cream and it smells like stale flour water; it makes me sick to my stomach. And it cost like 20 bucks. WATTERS: But it gives you that nice close shave, Gutfeld. GUTFELD: How would you know. WATTERS: You look good. (CROSSTALK) MCDOWELL: I would smell your face-- CAFARO: All over my face. GUTFELD: I've got sauce all over me, now I've got to change. BONGINO: That was I know I said at the beginning that was good. CAFARO: It was good. GUTFELD: Did we lose producers. MCDOWELL: No. CAFARO: They're just letting us eat ice cream. WATTERS: Are we on air. MCDOWELL: So, we are in the middle of July but there's an online petition we want to tell you about that is calling for a big change to Halloween. The spooky celebrations date falls on a Thursday this year but this petition is asking for it to permanently be switched the last Saturday of October to be safer, longer and a stress-free celebration. Greg, they say this is for the children. GUTFELD: Right. MCDOWELL: It's not. It's because people get drunk and the women want to dress up like trawl ups and harlots and they want to be out all night long. GUTFELD: It's run its course; it's been co-opted by adults. I don't need to see somebody dressed up like a sexy mermaid throwing up on my lawn. That's a jab at Kilmeade. You don't need an opportunity to go out and dress up, just do it on your own time. Don't ruin my life. WATTERS: See I like Halloween and I like the parties and the festivities that go along with it. And when you have Halloween on the 31st, it could fall on any day of the week. So, then you get two Halloweens. You get the Saturday night weekend Halloween. GUTFELD: That's true. WATTERS: Party and you get maybe the Thursday or the Wednesday-- BONGINO: Outside of the box thinking I have to tell you when I first read this, I thought this was dumb. But I've got to agree I like to party a little bit. I'm not really a party guy. And you can't with the kids, and they got to go to school. CAFARO: I can't stand it. I'm not a Halloween person. I never have been. You know I mean I've actually - I don't know if you guys have ever seen the skit about all the ridiculous sexy Halloween costumes like sexy Abe Lincoln, it's like what. WATTERS: How do you make Abe Lincoln sexy? CAFARO: I mean you know a certain kind you can wear. GUTFELD: He ended slavery. That's sexy enough for me. WATTERS: Freedom is sexy. MCDOWELL: You make Abe Lincoln sexy in one way as you make everything sexy fishnets. CAFARO: That's true. WATTERS: All right. MCDOWELL: And by the way you're going to hit a new low this year because you're going to dress your dog up. Watch. WATTERS: I'm that guy. MCDOWELL: Next on \u201cThe Five,\u201d Greg's got your Fan Mail Friday questions ready to go. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: The theme to the 1954 version of Godzilla. WATTERS: Nice. GUTFELD: Fan Mail Friday, let's get to your questions, OK. Try to keep this one clean from Judy L. As a kid, what did you keep hidden from your parents? Dagen. MCDOWELL: Richard Pryor albums. GUTFELD: That's good. MCDOWELL: My parents never could figure out why I had the foulest mouth of anybody that I have met. And I only told them a few years ago that I was sitting upstairs listening to Richard Pryor albums with headset on. GUTFELD: That's fantastic. MCDOWELL: Love it. GUTFELD: Jesse. WATTERS: Not marijuana. I would never do that. GUTFELD: Capri. CAFARO: I would hide Metal Edge magazine behind 17. GUTFELD: Really? CAFARO: And realize that I was like reading about chips enough from enough xenon and whatever else. GUTFELD: You're the only person who remembers chip. CAFARO: Poor chip. BONGINO: Wrist rockets, slingshots. GUTFELD: Yes. BONGINO: You know for some reason houses in my neighbors' windows were breaking. I had no idea what was happening, and I had a wrist rocket, so I don't know anything about Jen. The neighbors at that window. But it wasn't me. That's all I'm saying. GUTFELD: I can't believe nobody mentioned any form of adult entertainment periodicals. WATTERS: You've told us to keep it clean. GUTFELD: You did. You could have said adult entertainment. I had a coffee can of firecrackers and barrel bombs and a human thing. CAFARO: Why does that not surprise me? GUTFELD: Yes. Firecrackers were great. Facebook question from Frenchie. WATTERS: OK. GUTFELD: What's the best bad decision you ever made. That's pretty interesting and complex at the same time. Dan, what was your best bad decision you ever made. BONGINO: You know leaving the Secret Service. I loved it, its greatest job. Real Patriots over there. But everybody told me, are you nuts, you're going to leave to run in Maryland. GUTFELD: yes. BONGINO: As a Republican, as a senator. Like this is the dumbest decision ever. I know I'm here with you. GUTFELD: Exactly. BONGINO: What happens. GUTFELD: No regrets. No regrets. Capri. CAFARO: I missed Senate session. First year, I was in office to go to London for the Led Zeppelin reunion and I'm so damn glad I did it. GUTFELD: Led Zeppelin reunion. Jesse. WATTERS: I've got kicked out of an Allman Brothers concert one time and that was at intermission and that was a really good thing. BONGINO: What did you do? WATTERS: I couldn't have lasted that whole concert. GUTFELD: That's directly linked. WATTERS: Really, do me a favor. GUTFELD: That's directly linked to the earlier question about what he did. You are such a pothead. WATTERS: No, I'm not. Never. GUTFELD: OK. That's not true, I'm just joking. Dagen, MCDOWELL: Getting married the first time. GUTFELD: Yes. MCDOWELL: Yes, 11 months, but I got married on Friday the 13th and I remember vividly watching the Texas Chainsaw Massacre on my wedding night. CAFARO: Leather face. GUTFELD: I don't know that would be a success. I loved that movie. The best bad decision. I moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania. People would think it's weird, but it was actually kind of fun. WATTERS: Was that a bad decision for Allentown. GUTFELD: Well, I was 25. You don't necessarily go to Allentown when you're 25 and single. WATTERS: No. GUTFELD: And stay there for 10 years. WATTERS: Were you single the whole time. GUTFELD: Yes. All right. It's was a great place Allentown. I love the Lehigh Valley. Great question from Anne M. What sitcom world would you like to visit for a week. Dan? BONGINO: Come on, this is a ground ball. Who doesn't want to hang out with Kramer and Jerry, I mean come on? GUTFELD: They're miserable people. They're unlikable people. BONGINO: I want to be the one the episode where George does everything backwards and remember he curses out the boss against it. I want to be in that specific episode. I want to be in that one. That was awesome. WATTERS: I'd like to go to F.R.I.E.N.D.S. GUTFELD: F.R.I.E.N.D.S., of course. WATTERS: And kiss Rachel. GUTFELD: Yes. Everybody yes. Dagen. MCDOWELL: Three's Company. The Ropers, a blast. GUTFELD: No. That's a great one. CAFARO: Really good. GUTFELD: Also, you have the Regal Beagle. A gray far, do you remember that, it was a velvet 70's. CAFARO: Can I give you a real one here. Mama's Family. GUTFELD: Yes. CAFARO: I actually I just bought an off the shoulder jumpsuit that reminded me of like what is her name, Naomi, whatever her name was. So, Mama's Family. WATTERS: Greg's not excited with the possibility of living with two women. He's excited about the bar. Regal Beagle. BONGINO: Who was the friend, Larry. CAFARO: Larry. GUTFELD: Larry. Yes, Larry is a bit weird. I would have gone with What's Happening. The episode when the Doobie Brothers visited and taught them about the dangers of bootlegging albums. One of the great-- CAFARO: Albums. GUTFELD: Hello Skunk Baxter if you're watching. All right, Barbara S. Oh! We've got to go. Oh! One More Thing is up next. Wow, I didn't hear you. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: It's time now for One More Thing. Check out this runaway tire rolling down the highways in New Jersey. Look at it go. GUTFELD: Wow. WATTERS: There it goes. That's along route 440 minding its own business. And it just kind of crosses the median there. And there it goes, there goes a jeep. The off-duty officer who was driving the Jeep is fine now. Just a scratch. Everyone's quite all right. CAFARO: How's the tire. WATTERS: The tire. We're going to get back to you on that. CAFARO: OK. WATTERS: My sources haven't told me anything. Also, Watters World this week at 8 PM Eastern. It is Shark Week. Check out that graphic. What an unbelievable graphic. Hands up to the graphics department, they do a great job here at Fox News. Greg. GUTFELD: More anti-shark propaganda. WATTERS: Just wait and see, it's not what you think. GUTFELD: OK. The Greg Gutfeld Show, I've got Pete Hegseth tomorrow night 10 PM. I've got Jonathan Morris fresh from the priesthood and Tyrus at Saturday July 27 10 PM, be there. All right let's do one of these. Animals Are Great. This isn't a rubber tire rolling down the road endangering lives and probably causing death. But it's close. Check out this golden retriever. Doesn't know what's going on. You know for all that golden retriever knows that thing could be alive. But no, it's just a wind-up frog who has it in their lives been shocked by a wind-up frog. Sometimes I wake up and it'll be one of my chests. How did it get there? Look at that. Just can't get enough for that wind-up frog. WATTERS: I wonder what he'd do with the raw chicken. GUTFELD: Oh, my God. You know what-- WATTERS: That's scary stuff. GUTFELD: Are you saying you'd feed raw chicken to a dog, Jesse. You make me sick; you and the producers make me sick. Send your letters if you were offended by the raw chicken. WATTERS: I think the producers on this show do a really good job. Dan? BONGINO: I'll be on Tucker tonight, by the way for the news explosion, you can watch my head explode in that graphic. I love the graphics department back again. But I want to extend a big shout out to a good friend and old neighbor of mine, Steve Kaminskas (ph) and his family, it's Donna Riley and Laney (ph) just became U.S. citizen. Been in the country for wise Canadian. I used to bust his chops a little bit about getting his citizenship. He finally did it. If you haven't been to a naturalization ceremony, by the way it is one of the greatest things you'll ever witness. Here's Steve with my other good friend Bryan, who is a state delegate in Maryland. We all lived in the same neighborhood. And this last picture is me with a horrible tattoo and my beautiful wife and then my then five-year-old daughter Isabel, 10 years ago when my wife Paula there she didn't know I was going to do this got her citizenship just hours removed from her own ceremony. I'll tell you it'll bring tear to your eye watching all these great people from all over the world come here and pledge allegiance to our flag. Thank you to all of you, Steve. Paula, my wife and everyone out there and came in the country legally. You're all great. WATTERS: And God bless that tattoo on your arm. BONGINO: It's horrible. WATTERS: What was that? BONGINO: It's a curse. I can't even tell you. CAFARO: Did you get rid of it you sign it. BONGINO: No, it's a cover tattoo. I had another bad tattoo, that's-- WATTERS: It looks like the vegan ice cream. All right, Dagen. MCDOWELL: Go to Red Hill in Virginia. Patrick Henry's last time in a burial place for their naturalization ceremony every spring. I want to say that. And why is America great. We're the land of the free because we're the home of the brave. To Tommy Zurhellen, he's in the middle of a nearly 3000-mile walk across this country. Tommy, a Navy vet himself is taking this journey to raise awareness on a national level about veteran homelessness and veterans' suicide. A coast to coast walk started in April, started in Portland. He plans to finish in New York next month. He walks 22 miles a day to represent the average number of veterans who take their own lives each day. 40,000 veterans sleep on our streets. They deserve that better, visit veteranzero.org. WATTERS: He should finish up here at Fox News. That'll be a great finish line for him. MCDOWELL: Absolutely. GUTFELD: He's not watching, he's walking Jesse. WATTERS: OK. You can watch it on this a little phone. GUTFELD: Now you want him to watch while he's walking. That's not safe. WATTERS: He can do two things at once. CAFARO: Well I try not to text and walk, but it's a tough habit to break. Well, some of you may know that I started my career actually working with older adults back in Ohio and so I was really excited when I saw this story about a group of senior citizens that actually go to a summer camp just for seniors. It is put on by a Catholic actually, a Jesuit organization called So Others Might Eat which is based in D.C. and nothing is more fun than bringing our senior citizens getting a little R&R. So, I thought it was a cute-- WATTERS: Too cute for Greg. He doesn't like cute stories; it makes him sick. Look at him. Breaking out of cold sweat. Have a nice weekend everybody.
