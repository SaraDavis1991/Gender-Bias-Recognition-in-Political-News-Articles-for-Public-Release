Good to see you. You know, we've been told all morning long that doctors were quote very pleased about the progress that the former president was making since he was admitted here to the hospital over the weekend. In fact, there was some talk of a potential discharge, that that could happen. But then, this afternoon, things changed. A spokesperson for the president came out and said that Mr. Bush was moved to intensive care for treatment of a respiratory issue relating to pneumonia. Now, a spokesperson for the president says Mr. Bush was moved, and doctors say that the 92-year-old was sedated, so that his airway could be cleared and secured. He's now said to be stable and resting comfortably, as is his wife, Barbara. The former first lady was also admitted to the exact same hospital here in Houston this morning, after she started experiencing fatigue and coughing.  Staffers say this was done as a precaution. But earlier in his final press conference, President Obama shared these words about the former first family."
