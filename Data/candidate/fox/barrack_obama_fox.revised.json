      "content": "This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" April 9, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. INGRAHAM: I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d from Washington. We now know when we'll have answers about the FBI's abuse of the FISA Court to spy on the Trump campaign. Congressman Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows are here to react. Plus, what don't the media and the democrats tell you about child separation under Obama? Newt Gingrich is here to expose it. Also, what is the President's path to victory in 2020? His campaign manager making a rare appearance. Brad Parscale will tell us tonight. And an 11-year-old little girl says she was shamed by her left-winged teacher when she proposed writing a pro-Trump report for school. Her parents are steaming mad and they are here exclusively to sound off. But first, persistence versus the resistance. That's the focus of tonight's \u201cAngle.\u201d After spending a few precious hours watching the Attorney General testify today before the House Budget Committee, I thought one thing. Why on earth did Bill Barr volunteer for this type of abuse? Leaving the comfort of his retirement just to have to answer to some of the nastiest people on the face of the planet? Nita Lowey of New York badgered Barr on his synopsis on the Mueller report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NITA LOWEY, D-N.Y.: All we have is your four-page summary, which seems to cherry-pick from the report to draw the most favorable conclusion possible for the President and make definitive legal conclusions in less than 48 hours. I would argue it's more suspicious than impressive. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: A knee-jerk liberal or just a jerk? Well, after watching this next clip, you decide. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LOWEY: Your conclusion is something we've seen before. In June 2018, you wrote a memo as a private citizen and a former Attorney General to the Department of Justice, laying out the President's case against obstruction of justice. Your audition clearly went well. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Your audition clearly went well. Wouldn't you just love to read Bill Barr's subliminal thoughts about this entire charade scrolling at the bottom of the screen off? I'd pay big money for that. Attorney General didn't need this. He already was Attorney General, don't forget, almost thirty years ago when he was a lot younger and probably had a lot more patience. But, like so many others in this administration, I'm thinking Bob Lighthizer at USTR, Wilbur Ross at Commerce, Alex Azar at HHS, Steve Mnuchin at Treasury, Betsy DeVos at Education, they all left their very comfortable lives and moves to Washington to help solve problems and make a difference. That's what civil service is supposed to be all about, isn't it? But, this is what they deal with instead. Like Alex Azar at a recent Senate hearing about the detention of alien kids. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEX AZAR, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: We are getting 300 to 350 unaccompanied alien children crossing the border and referred to HHS every single day right now. These are 10, 12, 13, 15-year-old kids. They're not coming with parents. They're coming across the border by themselves. SEN. JEFF MERKLEY, D-OR: What is the capacity of the child prison system that you're seeking with this money? AZAR: You keep saying prison system. If you have got an alternative approach to how to care for these children, please tell us because-- MERKLEY: Well, let me give that to you then. Let me explain it to you. (CROSSTALK) AZAR: It would be nice-- (CROSSTALK) (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I loved it. That's what every cabinet secretary should do in these hearings. Turn the tables on these people. Congress has the power to fix the immigration laws, don't they? And if child detention or separations are so offensive, \"Hey, why don't you change the laws?\" Better yet, seal up the border and the endless travesty altogether. Now, of course, Congress does have legitimate important constitutional obligations to do proper oversight of the executive branch. I'm all for it. But, what the Democrats have been doing since Trump took the oath of office isn't oversight, it's character assassination, either of the President himself that he was secretly working with the Russians or of anyone who works for him. Look at what the jackals did at Secretary Mnuchin's hearing today. Well, now, get this, we have a crisis on our southern border and all impedes 45 Mad Max scene cares about is Trump's old tax returns. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOYCE BEATTY, D-CALIF.: Secretary Mnuchin, will you comply with the law by the deadline tomorrow? STEVEN MNUCHIN, SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY: As I've said before, we will follow the law. BEATTY: You're not afraid that you will be fired if in fact you release two returns (ph)? MNUCHIN: Well, I am not afraid of being fired at all. I've said we will follow the law and we are-- BEATTY: Okay. Mnuchin, I'm very pleased you're not afraid of being fired. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now, coming up empty there, Auntie Maxine went back to her favorite category. I'll take Russian oligarchs for 500. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MNUCHIN: I don't believe I've ever met a Russian oligarch. BEATTY: So, you never met or talk with or had any conversations with Mr. Deripaska or with Mr. Viktor Vekselberg, or anybody about sanctions. Is that correct? MNUCHIN: That is correct. I've never met either of them. BEATTY: No, no, not met, but had a conversation with. MNUCHIN: I've never had any conversation with either one of them. BEATTY: Okay, let us continue. The gentleman from North Carolina, Ranking Member Mr. McHenry is recognized for five minutes. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: By the way, that went on longer there. Okay, she's is just a complete and utter embarrassment, along with Pelosi, the co-ruling queen of the resistance. How is any of this helping their constituents? The answer is, it's not. Now, the Republicans, remember they're also called the GOP as in the Grand Old Party. I'm thinking Democrats should be called just UP as in the Unserious Party, okay, because for more than a year the Trump team undertook the painstaking process of doing things like renegotiating NAFTA, the trade deal that had given unfair advantage to companies that move their plants to Mexico. Canada and Mexico both signed off on it. So, why has it Nancy Pelosi called it up for a vote, because she's unserious, she's parroting bogus concerns of her buddies over there at the AFL-CIO about labor laws in Mexico. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: It's a big issue how a labor - people or workers are treated in Mexico and we - to lift up our own workers, you don't do that by suppressing workers in other countries. It's an exploitation on both on both sides. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I don't know what that was. She and Beatty should get together. All right, exploitation, I haven't heard Nancy demand the same from China lately, have you? They don't do anything with labor law problems. The truth is Pelosi wants to throw sand in Trump's gears every chance she gets. If Obama had negotiated the same deal, she'd have been all for it. But, she'd rather deny Trump a victory than do the right thing by the American people. Same scenario by the way is that play with the ongoing invasion across our southern border. Congress could fix this in a weekend. Now, estimates are that this month alone, we could see 150,000 migrants overwhelming our border, our Border Patrol. So instead of closing loopholes, ending this crisis, Democrats just use every opportunity to grandstand for the cameras. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Homeland Security is descending into chaos. A major, massive curve (ph) is no substitute for a change in policy. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Congress must exercise its duty to provide a check on the executive branch. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You pretty much have to be a yes person. Otherwise, you do not last long. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nielsen will be known for implementing a cool policy. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Oh my God! It's so bad that cabinet secretaries get berated about policies totally out of their area of responsibility even. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT CARTWRIGHT, D-PENN.: Well, I'm dismayed to hear that you're willing to drive our healthcare system off the cliff with no plan for replacing it. BILL BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, I think the premise - your premise that the Justice Department makes healthcare policy is simply wrong. We take legal positions in cases. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Okay. How Barr remained as cool as a cucumber is beyond me. Now, even as the hearing was ending, Chairman Jose Serrano - we warned you about him last year - couldn't give the condescension and self-righteousness a rest. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOSE SERRANO, D-N.Y.: I grew up politically in the \u201860s; that's where I developed a lot of my feelings about things in our great country. It's very troublesome to see a Justice Department against the law of the land. We lean on you to come through for this country and when we see you taking sides against the law of the land, or taking sides that we may not think is in the best interest of the American people, it troubles us. Nevertheless, we want to thank you for your testimony today. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Yes. We all should be thanking Bill Barr and the entire Trump team. Now, despite a constant stream of defamatory attacks and scurrilous charges from the Democrats, the Trump Administration has still managed to accomplish an enormous amount for our country, with the economy, the courts, on trade, et cetera. Mindful persistence versus mindless resistance; Americans will have a clear choice in 2020 and that's \u201cThe Angle.\u201d Now, there's a big headline out of the Barr hearing that I couldn't even get to in \u201cThe Angle.\u201d (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Office of the Inspector General has a pending investigation of the FISA process in the Russian investigation and I expect that that will be complete in, probably in May or June, I am told. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: My next guest certainly didn't miss that and joining me now, Congressmen Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows. Congressman Jordan, do you expect this report to bring some resolution? REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OH: I hope so. The Inspector General's reports have always been good and it's - interestingly enough, Mark and I met with Mr. Horowitz today and he said exactly what the Attorney General said. He said- - INGRAHAM: Yes. JORDAN: --that in May or June, he expects his report. Remember, the last one last year, he's the one who told us about Andy McCabe who lied three times under oath, lied to the Inspector General himself, lied to James Comey. So, we expect the Inspector General to do the good work that he has always done and like the Attorney General said, and you're right, the Attorney General has handled himself so professionally, so solid, so steady. I think what the American people want in an Attorney General; I've been very impressed with him. INGRAHAM: He said another - made another point about the FISA abuse investigation. You guys did your own? REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: Right. INGRAHAM: In calling for another one, let's watch what Barr said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARR: I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Tonight, we learn he has a team, he has put together some team of people - we don't know who's on the team, but what are you expecting? MEADOWS: Yes, I don't know who's on the team, but I can tell you if they're near the quality of this AG, we can expect great things. I think Jim and I have walked away very, very impressed with two things, one is he wants to get to the truth and make sure the American people have had the truth before them, wherever it leads, and the second is, is that he is extremely diligent about making sure that no stone goes unturned. I mean he's looking at every aspect. And so, this particular comment was refreshing to Jim and I because it goes beyond - it appears it goes beyond what the IG is looking into. JORDAN: And notice the time frame. He said the summer of 2016. MEADOWS: Yes. JORDAN: We're going to start of this. MEADOWS: Yes. INGRAHAM: Bingo. JORDAN: That's what was so important about this. This is when Christopher Steele is starting to give the installments on the dossier and remember, they take this dossier to the secret court and they don't tell the court who paid for it. They don't tell the court that Christopher Steele is biased against the President, extremely biased against the President, and they don't tell the court that later they had terminated Steele from actually working-- INGRAHAM: They lied about Carter Page. I'm going to say this tonight. They lied - I've had Carter page on this show. He's a quirky kind of guy. But, I went through the - the oligarchs, all the people I ever met. Like I saw someone at a conference, said hi in the hallway. I don't even - but the guy that this is a linchpin of some big, you know, election manipulations, is - was ridiculous. He was used as a lever to get - (CROSSTALK) MEADOWS: You're exactly right. INGRAHAM: I'm sorry. I don't know-- MEADOWS: No, no, you're exactly right. I think one of the interesting things is, is four different phases on - INGRAHAM: On him. MEADOWS: --and no indictment. I mean, you know, come on, it's-- INGRAHAM: Hey guys, what I talked about on \u201cThe Angle,\u201d I'm very serious about this. I happen to know Bill Barr; I've known him for decades. MEADOWS: Yes. INGRAHAM: Okay. The fact that a man like that, who was Attorney General, he was a CEO of a top telecom company in the world, internationally-acclaimed- - MEADOWS: Yes. INGRAHAM: --incredible person, had to put up with that and still gets put - has to put up with it. MEADOWS: Yes. INGRAHAM: --not oversight but abuse, this is abuse. This is what Nadler and Schumer are saying about him. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JERRY NADLER, D-N.Y.: He is a biased person. He is someone who is an agent of the administration, is an appointee - a political appointee of the President whose interest he may very well be protecting here. REP. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: I don't think Barr has conducted himself in a manner that earns people's trust. Color me dubious that he's going to be fair unless he proves otherwise. (END VIDEO CLIP) MEADOWS: Yes, Laura, one of the interesting things when we look at that, Jerry Nadler says this for television, but in private he's exactly the opposite. You know, there's two Jerry Nadlers out there. INGRAHAM: Wow. MEADOWS: And there's the one that wants all about transparency when he comes before the American people but in the privacy of rooms, where Jim and I've been, oh, he wants to make sure that everything is protected and orchestrated just the way he wants. You know, it's time that we peel it back and let the America people know. INGRAHAM: But what do they expect that - that Bill Barr or the AG was going to be chosen by Nadler? MEADOWS: Yes. INGRAHAM: It's like, well, this is the Trump's chosen guy. Duh, and remember when Holder said he was Obama's wingman? MEADOWS: Yes. INGRAHAM: --when he was Attorney General. They didn't have a problem with that. JORDAN: Yes, Bill Barr is a good man, doing a good job. These guys can't help themselves. They're so focused on the President, they can't help the country. Think about last week, Nadler does his subpoena for the Mueller report, even though Bill Barr said he's going to give it to us in a matter of days. Cummings does two letters to the bank and to the accountant of the President-- INGRAHAM: Unbelievable. JORDAN: --seeking his private business records. And Richard Neal, the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee says, \"I want his tax return,\" for purely political reasons. All in one week; these guys are completely focused on that, and not doing what's best for the country. INGRAHAM: We got a crisis on the southern border; we're going to get into this later. JORDAN: Exactly. INGRAHAM: Crisis on the southern border. 150,000 people they estimate could be coming in just this month. JORDAN: Yes. INGRAHAM: And they want the tax returns. Maxine is making a big deal about it. MEADOWS: Oh, I mean these are twenty-twenty subpoenas. They have nothing-- INGRAHAM: That says nothing. MEADOWS: .with transparency. INGRAHAM: What about Mike Cohen? You have a big press conference tomorrow. Any sneak peek? What can we get from you? MEADOWS: You know, we've got a plan that we're going to really make sure that we hold Cohen accountable. INGRAHAM: A prison ministry, what are you all doing? MEADOWS: And put everybody on record. JORDAN: He lied seven times to Congress. Two are just undisputable - indisputable, I should say. So, we're going to talk about that tomorrow and we are going to be joined by the minority leader Kevin McCarthy. MEADOWS: Yes. INGRAHAM: Fantastic. MEADOWS: Yes, so it will be good. INGRAHAM: Thank you. MEADOWS: Tune in at 11. JORDAN: You bet. INGRAHAM: Thank you for coming in tonight. We really appreciate it. They did 40 interviews. You did 40 interviews, by the way, didn't you, over the course of your own investigation? JORDAN: Yes. MEADOWS: Yes. INGRAHAM: Well, I'm glad you met with the attorney-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Inspector General. That is a good little tidbit tonight. All right, remember those reports last week that the Muller team was not happy with Bill Barr's summary letter to Congress, well, it turns out they had a chance to review it, the Muller team, but they declined. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARR: Mr. Mueller's team did not play a role in drafting that document, although we offered him the opportunity to review it before we sent it out and he declined that. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Boom, for years now Sol Wisenberg, former Whitewater Deputy, Independent Counsel, and now Fox News contributor. Sol, why would Mueller not want to read Barr's synopsis before it was released? SOL WISENBERG, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think it injects him into, probably in his mind, into a political function that really is, I mean (ph) the Attorney General is Chief Law Enforcement Officer but he also plays a political role. That's Bill Barr's function. Once Muller said, \"I'm not going to make a decision about whether or not this is criminal obstruction or not,\" I don't think it's his function to review that. By the way, if he did review it, he would become political. If he reviewed it and didn't have a problem with it, the democrats would attack him and the Republicans would use him as a cajole (ph) against the Democrats. So, I have no problem with Mueller declining to review it. I do have a problem if any of his people leaked their unhappiness with Attorney General Barr to the press. But remember, Barr made it very clear in his letter. He said, \"Mueller isn't making the call.\" But Mueller took all the obstructive acts, the allegedly obstructive acts and he set out both sides of the question, both sides of the issue, the side that would this might be obstruction and the side that would argue against it. INGRAHAM: Right. WISENBERG: So, we're going to see all that. Barr did not suppress anything. There's nothing wrong whatsoever with that letter that he wrote. INGRAHAM: Yes. WISENBERG: It was just an interim report, that's all. INGRAHAM: They badgered him. I did this on \u201cThe Angle.\u201d They badgered him on this summary. And he said - he basically said, he went to great lengths not the really summarize but to use as much of the language from Mueller himself as he could without revealing redacted material or potentially redacted material. He said, \"No material was even flagged for redaction,\" and thus he was kind of in a bit of a bind, but he decided to release the four pages in the interest of public disclosure, because he knew the public wanted something. But he basically says, \"Let's wait until the whole thing comes out and then we can have further discussion.\" I know, Sol, you were keeping your eye on a D.C. Circuit Court opinion about grand jury materials. We don't have to get too wonky here, but it's very interesting and I want you to explain it to us. WISENBERG: It came out just a few days ago. It's Barr vs. McKeever; it's a historian that wanted grand jury records released from 1957 and the District Court said, \"You know, I have the inherent authority. I don't need Rule 6(e). District courts have the inherent authority to release grand jury materials.\" The D.C. Circuit overruled him a couple of days ago and said, \"No, you don't. If it's not a judicial proceeding under 6(e) - in connection with a judicial proceeding, you cannot release - order the release of grand jury materials.\" And that could have - what that could essentially mean is that even if Barr wanted to, he doesn't, but even if Barr wanted to go to the court and get a 6(e) exception, he probably couldn't get one in D.C. INGRAHAM: They pressed him on that. They actually - we didn't play this sound bite THE ANGLE, Sol. But, they actually pressed him on that today, I can't remember which congressman, but pressed him on the 6(e) and they were saying, why don't you - why didn't you go to the court and ask for certain information, or will you go to the court? And he says, \"I don't have any plans to.\" And he said, \"Why don't you go to the court?\" And they said, well, and they kind of put it off. He said, \"Well, if you have an issue, I'll review it with you and if you make some good case then I guess I could.\" So, they actually raised that, but they didn't get into the D.C. Circuit decision. Fascinating. Sol, thank you so much. WISENBERG: Likewise. INGRAHAM: And ahead, exposing how the democrats in the media continue to cover up the Obama Administration's role in child separation at the border. Fact from fiction. Newt Gingrich is here, live on that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: Obama separated the children. Those cages that were shown, I think they were very inappropriate. They were built by President Obama's Administration, not by Trump. Take a look. The press knows it; you know it; we all know it. INGRAHAM: Well, within moments of that, the child separation under Obama, the media rushed to 44's defense. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The President tried to falsely blame Barrack Obama for the policy which is widely regarded as highly inhumane, a moment that showed some separation between Mr. Trump and the truth. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is a direct lie when the President blames the Obama Administration on separation. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are going to need a backup generator for the fact- check machine. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Backup generator - well, come on, this is interesting. So, it is in June of last year, even McClatchy Newspapers had to admit this in a headline, \"Yes, Obama separated families at the border too.\" And then today, in one of the more remarkable admissions that I have ever seen, Sam Vinograd who is a CNN national security analyst and Obama alum said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAM VINOGRAD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: President Obama separated children from their families wolfs - from adult wolfs, it was for their protection. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right. VINOGRAD: It was if there was a risk of trafficking or other kind of harm that might have been incurred. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That's what the Trump folks are doing now. If the child's welfare is in jeopardy, they have an obligation to keep the child safe. Ever heard of it? Well, when Obama does it, it's good; when Trump does it, it's cruel. Joining me now, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Fox News Contributor, host of the fabulous new podcast Newt's World. Mr. Speaker, did the media all of a sudden get Obama Administration amnesia here? NEWT GINGRICH, CONTRIBUTOR: No, not all of a sudden. The media has been operating for four to three years on the premise that if Donald Trump does something, it's evil and if the same thing is done by a Democrat, it must have really been good. This is (ph) who they are. INGRAHAM: They're so obsessed with hating Trump that they've lost all - it's like someone obsessed - GINGRICH: Right. INGRAHAM: ...in a relationship. Like you - you can't text someone 15 times every five minutes, that's bad. But you lose all sense of reality, well, that's like what they're so obsessed with hating on Trump that they can't remember what happened three years ago. GINGRICH: Well, but I think you have to start with that notion, none of these people represent the news media. You could say that they represent fake media; you could represent - that they represent anti-Trump propaganda, but they don't have any interest in the truth. They want to know, what can they do today to hit Donald Trump and that's their whole lot method and it's a groupthink that it is pretty astonishing. And we have very seldom in our country's history seen the kind of groupthink that we now have. In fact, I just did a newsletter in which I compared it to the Salem Witchcraft trials and to Savonarola in Florence in the 15th Century, and - this is how it was (ph) the flagellants in the middle ages. You suddenly have this wild pattern sweep and people begin doing crazy things because they are all doing it and therefore they have to do it. INGRAHAM: Speaking of burning people at the stick, this is what they are doing now to people as they leave the administration. I want to show you what it was tweeted today about Kirstjen Nielsen. Now, this was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeting - retweeting the senior writer for Rolling Stone Jamil Smith, \"Kirstjen Nielsen should be a pariah for life. No cable deals, no cushy college gigs.\" On what should happen to Trump's foot soldiers who think they can escape with their reputations intact simply because they were following orders and the - you know, the favorite spokesman for the Democrats today, self- appointed AOC says, in stealing thousands of children deporting their parents, refusing to provide info on reunification, Nielsen oversaw one of the largest scale - I don't know if that's grammatical, but largest scale human rights violations in recent history, awarding her a lucrative deal, prestigious post, is to legitimize and celebrate that abuse. So, they want to make it toxic nuke (ph)-- GINGRICH: Sure. INGRAHAM: --for anyone to be connected with, work for or support any policies that Trump has ever been associated with. GINGRICH: You get the level of hatred from these folks that Lincoln got from the slave owners. I mean you have a level of just deep vitriolic hatred and they think that anything they can do is okay because they're pure, anything they do to us is okay because we're bad. INGRAHAM: Ilhan Omar said, \"Stephen Miller at the White House us a white nationalist. He's a Jewish American.\" And she gets away with that; it's on cover Newsweek. GINGRICH: Yes, well, this is the person who today said some people did some bad things at 9/11. And now, I mean, you can't describe who did it or what they did, it just tells you how literally these people are being brainwashed into a left-wing theological position that is a frenzy. INGRAHAM: The cabinet for this administration, a lot of people aren't familiar with the names and the personalities, individuals. But, I said earlier in \u201cThe Angle\u201d that here, these people are really - these people have had really successful lives, very comfortable lives. They come into this town, they're defamed, they're maligned, they're called traitors, treasonous, white nationalists, racists, xenophobes and I'm thinking they still - they still show up to work every day and they still fight for this country. You know, might not agree with everything they do , but that's OK. But this is what it is. It's not Congressional oversight, Newt, is it? Is that -- GINGRICH: No, no, no. This is closer to an inquisition. But I love the moment today with Water, Congresswoman Waters, going after Secretary Mnuchin, and Mnuchin explaining he wasn't afraid of being fired. And I don't think Congresswoman Waters has any idea how wealthy Mnuchin is. (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: That'd be the best thing that ever happened to him. He'd probably get to go back to New York. GINGRICH: Waters might be worried about getting fired, because she has not visible means of support. But Mnuchin will be fine. It's amazing to watch the level of ignorance that the Democrats are now displaying. They're combining two factors. They're really ignorant, and they believe in really weird ideas. INGRAHAM: You think about just what the Obama team did when it came to the crush at the border. Remember 2013, 2014, 2015. The numbers started to spike. The Obama team said they're going to have to go home. He set his own benchmark with the DACA kids if you came, I think, after December, 2013, you'd have to go home. That was Obama's immigration priority. But when things got crowded, they're like, oh, my God, let's just start releasing people. So they started releasing all these people, Newt, which helped lead to this crisis. But they built family detention centers in Texas and Florida, put people in Pennsylvania. They ran out of space and they just started releasing people. People don't realize Obama had this crush, too. And he just gave up, and he just decided, I'm not going to fight this. Let them all go. GINGRICH: Yes. And of course, I think what people realize is, every time you do that, you increase the number of people who want to come here, because the word goes back home, hey, if you get there, they're going to let you in. And of course the judges -- one of the real stories here, as an attorney you understand much better than I do, the number of judges who are at the heart of our immigration problem because of their capricious involvement in telling us what we can't do I think should be a major scandal. INGRAHAM: It is -- I think it's like a Constitutional crisis that one district court judge can imperil the entire sovereignty of the United States of the America, which is what happened again yesterday and the day before in San Francisco. Another district court judge -- GINGRICH: And doing it on national security issues. INGRAHAM: The Supreme Court is going to have to get involved. Newt, it's great to see you, as always. GINGRICH: Good to see you. INGRAHAM: And how is Trump going to win reelection in 2020? His campaign manager is here. He'll tell us, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Today's radicalized Democrat Party has moved further away from the voters they need to win in 2020. They still have no clue, it's unbelievable really, how to speak to the working class white voters, let alone how to get their votes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: So we told you last night about how the Democrats are leaving the white working class behind. It probably explains why the president won, of course, in 2016. And even the \"New York Times\" had to admit it. But now, with the left trying to woo the white working class all again, how is Trump going to protect this significant voting bloc? Joining me now exclusively is Brad Parscale, campaign manager for Trump 2020. I can't believe, Brad, we're at 2020, thinking that this is where we are. BRAD PARSCALE, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Yes, I know. INGRAHAM: Now, what is the campaign going to do to lock down that base voter? Some Trump voters turned against Republicans in 2018. That's a fact. How are you going to bring them back? PARSCALE: Well, I do think there is a little misinformation about that. There was a lot of people that said from '14 to '18 that suburban white women left. They didn't. There's different types of people come out for different types of cycles. So I think it's hard to look at a ticket without the president on the ticket and say, oh, they turned against him. I think the president has done things. If you look at the budget, with family leave, I think if you look at what we've done in the way the president is pushing against socialized medicine, and suburban moms really want -- INGRAHAM: What do you mean socialized medicine? PARSCALE: Pushing against that. INGRAHAM: Oh, yes. PARSCALE: Bureaucrats, pushing against that, meaning that, do these moms really want their kids sitting in lines waiting to say, hey, can we get, you know -- INGRAHAM: But they freak out. The women freak out because of the tweets, the tone. I can't tell you how many women that I talk to, I like the money in my pocket. I wish he wouldn't tweet so much. And I always say, look, that's part of who he is. He connects with the voters that way. That's how he does it. But for women, it's like they love the charming Trump. They love Trump with an arm around someone, a little self-deprecating, which we see. And I've said this on the show many times, so if he's watching he knows what I'm saying. But women like that kind of charm. Obama had it, Clinton has it, and Trump does have it. How does he deploy it more effectively? PARSCALE: Maybe that's something we need to show more. One thing I always say when I'm interviewed is how great he is in person and how funny. And you probably know this, too. I've sat on Air Force One while he's throwing Starbursts at me. He's actually a fun guy. And he really likes people. INGRAHAM: But he sees it as a sign of weakness to come out on stage and try to be too jokey. He's like, this is serious business. I'm the president, and I'm going to kick blank and take names, which people also like. But that is something that I think for this election they're not going to be caught off guard. The left is like, we're not going to be caught off guard. We were in 2016. No more. PARSCALE: Yes. Look, I think we have a lot of candidate, we don't know what's going to be on the other side yet and what position the president will take. I think this president is one of the best marketers in American history. I think he understands the people, he understands how to communicate to people. And he's going to move in a way based off of the other candidates. Either way, though, I think he's going to stay strong. He's fighting for this country. He did this for no other but to save the country, and I don't think he's going to move away from that, and I hope he doesn't because it's still how he won the election, and it's going to be how he continues to win. INGRAHAM: It's been floated that Trump could be sabotaging his own 2020. One of my colleagues on FOX, Tucker Carlson, was like, maybe he doesn't really want to run in 2020. And Tucker is not the only person who has said that. Others have said that. Is there anything to that? PARSCALE: We're building one of the largest political campaign operations in history. I think he's put so much emphasis into what we're building in 2020. I go in weekly and give these reports. He would be wasting a considerable amount of time, which he does not like to do. INGRAHAM: So, we can put that to rest? PARSCALE: Yes. And by the way, I hope so, for my own job's sake. INGRAHAM: Yes, what are you going to be doing, Parscale? You're going to go work on Madison Avenue. Last month \"Politico\" reported that some advisors are telling the president to hold off on 2020 rallies. Whose bright idea is that? Is that accurate? PARSCALE: No. INGRAHAM: Because it seems like he get energized the rallies. PARSCALE: No, I don't think that's accurate. What we talked about doing is mixing official events with campaign rallies. He needs to get on the road, also, and talk about all of his achievements, all the promises that have been kept, and get out there and do those things. But rallies aren't going away. We already have a couple on the line for this month. We're going to continue to be out there. The president is going to get out there and engage with people. By the way, there are huge data mining operations. They're important for multiple reasons. INGRAHAM: Yes, so you're getting emails at these rallies? PARSCALE: No, cellphone numbers. INGRAHAM: Oh, cellphone numbers. PARSCALE: At the last rally we go over 100,000 cellphone numbers. INGRAHAM: Now, people say Brad is so young. He's like this tech guy. They said in 2016, who is this guy, Brad? And then he ends up winning. And now we understand other campaigns are trying to find their own Brad. They're bradding it. PARSCALE: It's \"Parscalization\" they called it. It was the term, which I became a verb. INGRAHAM: \"Parscaling up.\" PARSCALE: Yes. I think it shows, they all talked about how the president didn't know how to run a campaign. Now they're all trying to copy his campaign. It goes to show I wish they would copy his policies because he knows the right policies to get the country fixed as well. It's ironic that they've chosen this. But the fact is the world has changed, marketing is being driving more and more to cellphones, technologies, and the Internet. And they're chasing it. INGRAHAM: Are you going to pinpoint the person on the block who cares about the issue, are you going to get that specific? PARSCALE: People in the house. INGRAHAM: So families that disagree? PARSCALE: Yes, families disagree. We target them differently. Most of us have our own individual track. It's not by an address. We create our own maps and our own steps across the Internet, and we track that. INGRAHAM: And one candidate you're focused on? PARSCALE: Look, I just said, today I said I had to go to the office to buy a bigger binder because we're trying to track all these candidates. It's going to get so thick. I'm flipping through the pages. I think right now I don't see any clear person that is stepping up to the president. INGRAHAM: Minnesota, could he flip it next time? PARSCALE: I think New Mexico, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada I think are all good places for us to be right now. INGRAHAM: Are you going to flip one, that's your goal, or two? PARSCALE: Or three or four. That's my goal. It'll be a good night if I get more than two of those. INGRAHAM: I know you're at Andrews Air Force base. PARSCALE: Early tomorrow morning, yes. INGRAHAM: Thanks for joining us. PARSCALE: Thank you very much. Thank you very much. INGRAHAM: And an 11-year-old student says she was shamed by her teacher for choosing Trump as the subject of her school report. Her parents are here to sound off. You don't want to miss it. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: I learned about this over the weekend, and I was just infuriated. An 11-year-old girl, Bella Moscato, was told she had to write a report on her hero. She quickly chose President Trump, president of the United States, someone she has admired since she was in third grade. But her teacher says no, shamed her in front of other students, and warned Bella to choose a different hero. The school district superintendent telling \"The Ingraham Angle\" \"the District does not endorse or condone any limitation or prohibition upon a student's choice of the president as the subject of his or her \"Hero\" report. We certainly regret that any student or parent may have been made to feel otherwise.\" Bella's parents Valerie and Arthur Moscato join me now. Valerie, it's great to have you guys on. What exactly did the teacher say now when Bella said Trump was her hero? VALERIE MOSCATO, DAUGHTER SAYS TRUMP IS HER HERO: When she found out that Trump was her hero, she said, you're not allowed to pick Trump. He spreads negativity, and he says bad things about women. And I was like floored when I heard that. INGRAHAM: Well, for a little girl to have the poise to not just buckle under the pressure and actually come home and, Arthur, say, mom, dad, this doesn't seem right, that's what actually gives me a lot of hope, is that your little girl, Arthur, said, you know something, no, I'm not giving in. That's pretty unusual, I have to say. ARTHUR MOSCATO, DAUGHTER SAYS TRUMP IS HER HERO: Well, I'm going to say this to you. My daughter called my wife during the school day to let my wife know that. And the upsetting thing to me, which I actually found out later, was that not only was my daughter told that she couldn't do that, but she had to go around and pick somebody else as her hero. When my daughter spoke to my wife -- yes, somebody else's hero. VALERIE MOSCATO: Yes, go around and go choose, go look. ARTHUR MOSCATO: Go choose somebody else's hero from the other students. INGRAHAM: And didn't somebody in the class also pick Obama and that was OK? ARTHUR MOSCATO: Yes. VALERIE MOSCATO: Apparently, yes. INGRAHAM: Naturally, that's a shock. ARTHUR MOSCATO: So, my outburst at the Board of Ed meeting had a lot to do with that, because -- INGRAHAM: Are you both satisfied -- sorry to interrupt, but are you both satisfied with the school's response here? I tweeted out your reaction. VALERIE MOSCATO: Absolutely not. INGRAHAM: OK. So what do you want from the school? They seem a somewhat apologetic. ARTHUR MOSCATO: I'm just going to say. The message that you just played my wife and I have never heard. VALERIE MOSCATO: Yes. ARTHUR MOSCATO: Now, listen, we love our community. And we have a lot of support within there. My daughter is one of four kids. We have three boys also. The school, we've always had very good experiences. And this one is a little sour. INGRAHAM: But Valerie, how important do you think it is for parents to speak out when this kind of stuff happens? Because it happens all the time. How important? VALERIE MOSCATO: I think it's extremely important. And I am very grateful and happy that this story has gotten as big as it has, because this story needs to be told. And I'm very proud that my daughter knew that that was wrong and called me during the school to tell me this, because, let me tell you, Laura -- INGRAHAM: You taught her. You taught her. VALERIE MOSCATO: Right. And if she didn't tell me this, she wasn't doing Trump. Everybody is asking, is she still able to do Trump. She's able to do Trump because of me and my husband, not because of the school, the district, or the teacher. Because we raised holy hell about it. And this is an in-school project. INGRAHAM: We're going to try to get the teacher, Valerie, on the show and see what she says now that she maybe has had some time to reflect on it, and we'll check back with you, because we're going to keep tracking these types of stories across the country. Thank you both for joining us, and give our best to your daughter. And up next, the inside story of how a veteran Democrat's refusal to use oppo research against AOC might have resulted in the unravelling of the Democratic Party. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's shocking primary victory over Joe Crowley the result of leaving oppo research on the table? A new book reveals how Crowley's refusal to challenge AOC over legitimate issues of campaign finance abuse might have not only cost him the seat but set the Democratic Party on an irreversible destructive radical course. Trace Gallagher has the inside story for us tonight. Trace? TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Laura. The book is called \"The Hill to Die On.\" It lays out how most political experts thought Joe Crowley's Congressional seat was, quote, safer than Fort Knox, saying Crowley was first elected in 1998 and that by 2016, he was among the Democratic Party's elder statesman, and was even thinking about challenging Nancy Pelosi for the party leadership. He eventually decided not to go against Pelosi. But by 2018, he was much more concerned about raising money for his fellow Democrats than defending his own seat. Even when he heard that a 28-year- old Bronx bartender had gathered enough signatures to qualify for the primary, the headline in the \"Queens Chronicle\" said, quote, \"Crowley expects an easy primary win.\" But the book's authors, \"Politico\" reporters Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman also note that Ocasio-Cortez had no problem going after Crowley, attacking everything from his voting record to his residency. The book says it, quote, \"was an open secret that Crowley lived with his family in suburban Virginia, not in Queens.\" And during their only debate, Ocasio-Cortez zeroed in on that point, quote, \"If a person loves their community they would choose to raise their family here. They would choose to send their kids to our schools. They would choose to drink our water and breath our air.\" But Crowley thought that going dirty against Ocasio-Cortez would be a sign of weakness, and the book says he had plenty of fodder he could have used against her, including that her campaign used tactics to evade campaign finance laws. A conservative watchdog group has now filed Federal Election Commission complaints against her. Laura? INGRAHAM: Trace, thanks so much. Maybe he will primary her. Tonight's the Last Bite, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: It's time for the Last Bite. It may be all the rage at bars across the country, but here's proof that you might want to think before you throw an ax for fun. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (SCREAMING) (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Nice hair flip. Can we do the -- I love how she does the hair. There it is. Watch the hair flip. Boom. All right. There's a woman says she wasn't drinking and she didn't realize how bad it was until she saw the video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Was it hard for you to watch? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, now looking back at it. I do realize it was really close. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: All right. Well, the kids love that one. All right. Don't get forget, podcast.

      "content": "Welcome to Fox News First. Not signed up yet?\u00a0Click\u00a0here. Developing now, Wednesday, May 2,\u00a02018 THE LEAD STORY - A POSSIBLE PRESIDENTIAL SUBPOENA:\u00a0Special counsel Robert Mueller told President Trump's legal team that he could subpoena the president to appear before a grand jury if Trump refuses an interview with Mueller's team, Trump's former lead attorney told the Associated Press ...\u00a0John Dowd told the AP that Mueller raised the possibility of a subpoena during a meeting with Trump's legal team in March. According to accounts of the meeting first reported by the Washington Post and confirmed by Fox News, Dowd retorted: \"This isn\u2019t some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.\" The meeting appears to have been the first time Mueller raised the possibility of compelling Trump to testify as part of his investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials ahead of the 2016 election.\u00a0The Post report came one day after Fox News, the New York Times and other outlets obtained a list of questions that Trump's legal team believes Mueller wishes to ask him. 'UNLAWFUL' DACA:\u00a0Texas and six other states have\u00a0filed a lawsuit against the federal government seeking to end the Obama-era program that protects hundreds of thousands of young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children ...\u00a0The Trump administration has sought to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, but the effort to phase it out has been blocked. About 800,000 youth, called Dreamers, are protected under the program\u2019s umbrella.\u00a0The lawsuit asks for all DACA permits to be rescinded or the administration to be blocked from issuing or renewing new requests. Specifically, it is meant to challenge \"whether the 2012 executive action unilaterally creating DACA was itself lawful,\" the suit states. NIKKI HALEY'S 'TAKING NAMES':\u00a0When Nikki Haley started as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, she warned she'd be \u201ctaking names\u201d of countries that do not have \u201cour back.\u201d Now, a newly released annual State Department report on voting records at the world body will tell her who exactly is in America\u2019s corner \u2013 and who is not ...\u00a0The report found that U.N. member states only voted with the United States 31 percent of the time last year on resolutions at the U.N. General Assembly \u2013 down 10 percent from the prior year. Reacting to the report, Haley said in a statement that it was not an \u201cacceptable return\u201d on the United States\u2019 investment and suggested this could factor into aid decisions. BATTLE FOR\u00a0WEST VIRGINIA BEGINS:\u00a0U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins,\u00a0West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and\u00a0former coal executive Don Blankenship, the top-tier candidates in West Virginia\u2019s Republican U.S. Senate primary, sparred in Tuesday\u2019s Fox News Channel debate over who is most conservative and more closely aligned to President Trump, while blasting Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe ...\u00a0Jenkins denied being a creature of the swamp, despite enjoying the backing from Washington Republicans. He emphasized his support for Trump. Jenkins\u00a0attacked Morrisey for past comments where he said\u00a0Trump wasn\u2019t his first choice in the 2016 primary. But Morrisey boasted of his eventual backing of Trump at the convention and his opposition to former President Barack Obama. Meanwhile,\u00a0Blankenship portrayed himself as the true outsider in the race, saying he wouldn\u2019t go to Washington to get along with GOP leadership, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\u00a0The U.S. Senate race in West Virginia is considered a toss-up in the midterm elections.\u00a0Republicans hope to unseat incumbent Democrat Sen.\u00a0Joe Manchin. PEACOCK SHIELD FOR BROKAW:\u00a0NBC News is facing accusations of victim-shaming and intimidation as it scrambles to protect its legendary anchor Tom Brokaw, who\u2019s been accused of sexual misconduct by three women ...\u00a0On Tuesday, Variety reported that NBC News\u2019 powerful standards and practices department, which sets editorial guidelines, mandated that any reports on the Brokaw accusations include that more than 100 current and former NBC News women had signed a letter of support for the embattled newsman.\u00a0The New York Post reported Monday night that many women at NBC News had felt intimidated into signing the letter.\u00a0All this comes after Brokaw shamed his first accuser, former NBC correspondent and former Fox News anchor Linda Vester, in a scathing email which called Vester an embittered liar resentful that she did not become a star at NBC News.

      "content": "This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" July 24, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Good to see you. Welcome to \u201cHannity.\u201d And, yes, we begin with this Fox News alert. The witch hunt is dead, gone. It is buried. The real Russia investigation is only beginning. Now, today's hearing kept up but will now go down in history as one of the single biggest, most epic embarrassments in history, in American history. What happened today should shock the conscience of every American. The liars in the Democratic Party, their cheerleaders and the media mob, they have been exposed yet again. You can never trust these people, ever. For two plus long years, two and a half years, there they were, now Robert Mueller, the golden goose. According to them, he was going to swoop in and prove their insane Russian lies, conspiracy theories once and for all. And that Donald Trump is going to be a washed up and impeached and run out of town. Well, as a matter of fact, I'm watching the media today, and they were just about more depressed nine they were at election night 2016. All week, they were hyping up Mueller's testimony. Just this weekend, you had two of the biggest liars in the United States Congress. There they were, Chairman Nadler, and the cowardly Adam Schiff, predicting Mueller's remarks will prove the president's guilty, and as an unindicted coconspirator, responsible for high crimes and misdemeanors. Well, it's safe to say that never happened, and per usual, the two biggest liars in Congress were caught lying again. Robert Mueller's testimony -- well, the only way to put it, it was an unmitigated disaster. It was ugly. Here is just a small sample of what went down. We have a busy show, a small sample. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LOUIE GOHMERT, R-TX: Mr. Mueller, who wrote the comments you read at your May 29th press conference? ROBERT MUELLER, FORMER SPECIAL COUNSEL: I'm not going to get into that. GOHMERT: OK, so that's what I thought. You didn't write it. REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE, R-TX: Can you give me an example other than Donald Trump where an investigated person was not exonerated because their innocence was not conclusively determined? MUELLER: I cannot, because this is unique. RATCLIFFE: OK, you can't -- time is short. I've got 5 minutes. Let's just leave it at you can't find it, because I'll tell you why. It doesn't exist. REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OH: What's interesting -- you can charge 13 Russians no one's ever heard of, no one's ever seen, no one's ever going to hear of them. No one's ever going to see them. You can charge them. You can charge all kinds of people who are around the president with false statements, but the guy who launches everything, the guy who puts this whole story in motion, you can't charge him. I think that's amazing. MUELLER: I'm not certain that I agree with your characterizations. JORDAN: Well, I'm reading from your report. REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: Only one thing is possible. Either Steele made this whole thing up and there were never any Russians telling him of this vast criminal conspiracy that you didn't find, or Russians lied to Steele. Now, if Russians were lying to Steele to undermine our confidence and our duly elected president, that would seem to be precisely your purview, because you stated in your opening that the organizing principle was to follow and thoroughly investigate Russia's interference. But you weren't interested in whether or not the Russians were interfering to Christopher Steele. And if Steele was lying, then you should have charged him with lying like you charged a variety of other people. But you say nothing about this in your report. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Great point, Jordan. Great point, Gaetz. These guys were amazing today, not a good day at all for Robert Mueller, the liars in the media mob, the conspiracy theorists, those pushing a hoax in Congress and the media. As a matter of fact, even a worse day for Democrats. They use Mueller as their big pawn in what was a disgusting political game. They came up empty, but dangerously close to literally creating damage that would probably be unfixable. Byron York writing that Mueller's confuse and daze performance raises questions about handling of the investigation. Obama's former chief strategist, David Axelrod, said this is very, very painful. The conspiracy theorists over there, Roswell Maddow's MSDNC, they even called the hearing, oh, just boring, and confused, then admitted, even Chucky Todd admitted it was a disaster. Well-known Trump hater Lawrence Tribe also called the hearing a disaster. And cue the violence because the witch hunt is dead. The media mob is in mourning. This is probably the most depressed since they've been since election night 2016 when they got those exit polls, 5:15, showed -- oh, my gosh. Donald Trump didn't win a single state. They started their coverage at 6:00. They were happy, gleeful, giddy, excited, they couldn't believe it. And then the night unfolded and reality caught up. Kind of like today. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There were times in the hearing when he was sharp as a tank. But we can't avoid the fact that there were times in the hearing that he was not. FORMER SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, D-MO: Today, he was a witness. He frankly wasn't a really good witness. They needed to bring the reports to life. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There you go. Yes. MCCASKILL: Well, it didn't come to life. It's still slumbering. In fact, it is in deep sleep. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He was the FBI director when I worked for George W. Bush. To be honest, this was not the Robert Mueller I knew. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bob Mueller is not a made-for-TV guy. And we live in a made-for-TV society. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you are looking for a made-for-TV kind of character, and Mueller was not that perhaps today. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You do not have that viral movie trailer moment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, we talk about folks preferring movies to books. Occasionally, the books are better than the movies. In this case, the book was much better than the movie. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A lot of Democrats in particular used the D-word and branded this a disaster. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On optics, this was disaster. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You look who's winning now. It certainly seems like Donald Trump is winning. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: They are sad. They are morning, because Mueller's testimony put a stake right through the heart of their lies, their impeachment dreams. Impeachment, well, now, it's political suicide, because it's finished. It's over. And while the media, of course, the mob is in mourning. President Trump, well, he was rightfully optimistic. But think about this. This president has lived with this almost since the time he came down the escalator with his wife Melanie. And it has gotten worse and worse every second, minute, hour of every day. But in spite of that, look at the success. Look at the trade deals. Look at the deregulation, a record low unemployment, the best employment situation since 1969. Isn't that great for the American people? Record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment. Now, I know if you watch other networks, you have probably never heard the statistics, in spite of this hanging over his head, the daily, incessant, non stop, pressure, heat that this president took, still got the job done. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I think everybody understands what's going on. There was no defense to this ridiculous hoax, this witch hunt that's been going on for a long time. This was a very big day for our country. This was a very big day for the Republican Party. And you could say it was a great day for me, but I don't even like to say that. It's great. The Democrats had nothing, and now they have less than nothing. And I think they are going to lose the 2020 election very big, including congressional seats because of the path that they chose. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Now, for years on this program, and I want to say a very big thank you to the ensemble team that we have. I can't mention everybody. I won't even begin to. But you know the people that we have had on. And we have been in the forefront of peeling one layer of the onion after another after another after another. It has been arduous. It has been shoe leather reporting, the way it should be done. And we were in the minority as others perpetrated the lying, the hoax, the collusion, the conspiracy theories. And you know what? We told you from the beginning that the president was burden with an unjust, bias witch hunt. We told you that today's hearing was nothing more than a political stunt, a Hail Mary, last ditch effort to keep the narrative alive. We also told you that Mueller's testimony would likely back fire on the Democrats. And as it turns, we were right all along. Now, part of this, as, well, the Attorney General Barr has stated. And, of course, we have John Durham, we have the inspector general. We have the attorney general of the United States saying full on that he will get to the bottom of all of this -- a rigged investigation, a dirty dossier with Russian lies, a real Russia influence story, which by the way, it seems, and Mueller even acknowledged today that, well, looks like the Russians with that phony dossier were trying to hurt President Trump the entire time, even \"The New York Times,\" recognizing that that Russian dossier was likely Russian disinformation from the get-go. Only took him two and a half years to catch up. That's sad. This country came painfully close. This great Democratic republic, the greatest country God gave man. We came dangerously close to allowing a few people, reckless, lawless people to spread lies, conspiracies, and a hoax, and successfully, trying to undo the will of the American people. First trying to prevent their favorite candidate from being indicted, they were successful. They tried to prevent Donald Trump from ever winning. And then, when he won. It is now officially over. Joining us with a full report from our nation's swamp, Capitol Hill senior producer, I keep saying that his hitchhikers guide to everything ought to be a mandatory reading for kids. Chad Pergram is with us. Chad, big day today. CHAD PERGRAM, CORRESPONDENT: A big day, Sean. Democrats say the hearing with Robert Mueller wasn't the end, but the beginning. In fact, one Democrat even suggested that committees. That's due to start on Friday. Now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi promises additional lawsuits and hearings. Tomorrow, the House Oversight Committee, perhaps a contempt of congress citation, for White House aide Kellyanne Conway. But what everyone wants to know is, did today's hearing move the meter on impeachment? I tried to get clarity from the speaker of the House. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: That information -- PERGRAM: So, that will be a telltale sign about whether or not you have information -- (CROSSTALK) PELOSI: Yes, we have several considerations. It's about what information is there. And this isn't endless. This isn't endless. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: Pelosi wants Democrats to have the strongest possible hand if they pursue impeachment. I also spoke with Democratic Texas Congressman Al Green. The House blocked Green's impeachment effort last week. Now, Green conceded that there wasn't a, quote, wow moment in the Mueller hearing. But Green said he thought that public sentiment would change if they started an impeachment inquiry. One source said to me, Sean, that that's like saying you have to pass the health care bill first to know what's in it. Back to you. HANNITY: All right, Chad. Great reporting as always. Thank you for your report from Washington. One of the most confusing moments again. This is now the sixth time this has happened. Well, that happened earlier today at the hearing and surrounding the topic of obstruction. Remember, Robert Mueller, he agreed with Bill Barr, told Bill Barr, told Rod Rosenstein and others that legal guidance about charging a sitting president, in other words, whether or not Department of Justice policies prevented him from considering literally charging a president of the United States, a sitting president or constitutional considerations. He said no from the beginning. And, by the way, from the Office of Legal Counsel, well, it was not taken into account when making his initial decision not to charge the president. Instead, he cited insufficient evidence, no underlying crime. And during a rambling nine-minute presser in May, which probably is more understandable today, he contradicted himself. He said the exact opposite. And a few hours later, I think the Attorney General Barr graciously threw him a lifeline. It was a joint statement. Special counsel's office, the A.G.'s office, they corrected what Barr said in that 9-1/2 minute press conference. But then again today, well, Mueller contradicted the opinion again, another flip-flop. That's now -- is he confused? Are you confused? You're not alone. And then, moments after he made the mistake, he went to the cowardly Schiff's committee and corrected the mistake again. Pretty much a disaster. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TED LIEU, D-CALIF.: I'd like to ask you the reason again that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of OLC opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct? MUELLER: That is correct. I have one correction to my testimony this morning. I like to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. Lieu who I said, and I quote, you didn't charge the president because of the OLC opinion. That is not the correct way to say it. As we say in the report, and as I said at the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: If you're dizzy and having a little time following the bouncing ball, that's understandable. That's the key detail. But joining us now for reaction, the attorney for the president, Jay Sekulow -- by the way, full disclosure. Sadly, he has a much lower ranking client on his list of clients. That is me. Along with attorney for the president, Rudy Giuliani, who also, I would hire in a heartbeat. And it's amazing. I want to publicly applaud both of you. The job that you -- no, I'm very serious here. And, Rudy, I mean, you guys complement each other. Rudy is a little bit of a -- well, Rudy does - RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: What am I? Who says I'd represent you? HANNITY: Well, that's true -- why would you? But I do pay on time. Jay will verify that. JAY SEKULOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: He does. HANNITY: But here's the thing. Mr. Mayor, I remember your press conference as mayor. We go back many, many years. We've been friends for many, many years. You have no problem throwing down with anybody. Jay, a little bit more behind the scenes, but together, you complement each other. GIULIANI: A little more diplomatic too. HANNITY: Probably Jay, I think -- GIULIANI: A great lawyer -- a great, great lawyer. HANNITY: The both of you are. GIULIANI: He's the guy in it. John Dowd would tell you this. Jane and Marty Raskin will tell you this, he's the guy that was in this from day one to -- HANNITY: He was. GIULIANI: -- to today. It's not quite obvious that hand is going to come up again one or two times, but we are going to have to push it down. The body was buried today. SEKULOW: Yes. HANNITY: You know, it's funny, you were Donald Trump before Donald Trump when you did conferences as mayor. GIULIANI: Oh, nobody is Donald -- please, don't give me in trouble. Nobody is Donald Trump. HANNITY: Well, that's true. But I want to talk about -- there is a very serious aspect to all of this, and that is our constitutional republic came dangerously close to a few powerful people using power and literally attempting to influence an election. SEKULOW: Yes. HANNITY: We had a Russian dossier used to influence an election. A media that ignored and politicians that ignored the real Russian influence, and they went after this president with lies and conspiracies. They came dangerously close. This was certainly an attempted coup, Mr. Mayor, in my view. GIULIANI: You could call it that. I mean, I would have probably resisted, a year, a year and a half ago. You were telling me a year, a year and a half ago, so I got involved in this. I didn't realize how bad it was. And, you know, Mueller's performance today is really an indication of also, in fact, there is no case. There never was a case. Peter Strzok said it best. Two years ago, there's no \"there\" there. So, how come we have an investigation if there is \"there\" there, unless there were people, for criminal reasons, meaning to oust him from office or prevent him from being president, that were pushing it. And when Mueller said today, it was beyond his purview to investigate the people who were trying to prevent people who were trying to take him out of office. I thought he was appointed to investigate interference with the 2016 election. He said beyond his purview 16 times. I counted them. The only thing in his purview was framing President Trump. That was it. SEKULOW: You know, Sean -- GIULIANI: Not Page, not Hillary, who paid $1.1 million to Russians and Ukrainians. They are not foreigners? That's not a crime? A big one, like money involved? SEKULOW: You know what Bob Mueller's biggest problem was today, Sean, in my view, defending the indefensible. That report and I've said it many times, is nothing you can defend because it's incomprehensible. First of all, the exoneration language. Prosecutors don't exonerate. The legal standard in the United States is not exoneration. You are found guilty or not guilty. And this -- we -- if we had the authority -- if we thought we could exonerate him, we would do so. He never had the authority in the first place. I think that's where he got in trouble. It was interesting to me that these statements about, you know, Bob Mueller says we can't exonerate the president. Bob Mueller couldn't exonerate himself, because the special counsel can't exonerate. So, this is -- this was absurd. And then, the theory of obstruction by tweet. But I think the most telling thing today was when former special counsel Mueller had to go before the committee after answering Ted Lieu's question incorrectly, as if they didn't know that question was coming, and had to go and correct it and said, we never made a determination regarding culpability of illegal violation here. Never made that determination. And if you read his letter in his report, he said it presented difficult questions of law and fact. You know what happens, Sean, when you have difficult questions of law and fact? You don't bring the case. And guess what, they did not. HANNITY: This is key. SEKULOW: So, is the president exonerated? Absolutely. HANNITY: This whole legal concept of, well, exoneration is ridiculous. Now, beyond the correction -- SEKULOW: That is a legal standard. There's no liability. That's what it is. HANNITY: Right. And you're right. If you either indict, if you have the goods or you don't indict and you don't say anything either. All right. Beyond the correction, how is it possible that he didn't know who Fusion GPS was? How is it -- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: How is it possible that, you know, literal -- go ahead. You want to say? GIULIANI: Absolutely pathetic. I mean, he didn't know what Fusion GPS was because he never investigated the alternative theories of culpability, which a prosecutor is ethically bound to do, if he's an ethical prosecutor. Now, Bob is an ethical prosecutor. But the guy wasn't in charge. Jay is too to say this. We went to one meeting today with Bob Mueller in a year and a half, he didn't know he couldn't indict the president. It took two days to get him to say that. SEKULOW: Right. GIULIANI: He was not in charge. It's painfully obvious. There was committees. They fought with each other. They all hated the president. They all loved Hillary Clinton. When he says he didn't know who he was hiring -- he doesn't look at resumes. He doesn't do FBI background checks. He doesn't realize that he hired the council to the crooked Clinton Foundation. I mean, come on! HANNITY: Stop right there. Mr. Mayor, he did not know that Jeanne Rhee had been the lawyer for Clinton. He did not know that what Fusion GPS was. He didn't want to know what happened on both sides of the Trump Tower meeting that everybody made a big deal of, where the Russian lady actually met with Fusion GPS twice. He didn't want to know about the dossier. How is that? SEKULOW: It's -- no, it's incomprehensible, like the report. So, here's what you had. This is what became clear today. Bob Mueller, the Mueller report was not authored by Bob Mueller. The investigation was not run by Bob Mueller. It was run by these deputies. And the fact of the matter is, this is what -- Rudy and I know, and our colleagues, the Raskins and others, know this. They did not abide by the so-called OLC opinion. As Rudy just said, until the summer of last year. So, this nonsense they knew from the beginning they were bound -- and that's why he had to correct it, because it wasn't true. Whether it was intentional or unintentional, that's irrelevant. You can't defend the indefensible. HANNITY: All right. This -- would this be a fair characterization? So, we now found out last week that all the hiring was done by Andrew Weissmann who has a history of prosecutorial misconduct, withholding exculpatory evidence. We can all read, Mr. Mayor, we can read the great book by Sidney Powell, \"Licensed to Lie\". GIULIANI: We kind of memorized it. HANNITY: We kind of did. Tens of thousands of Americans lost their jobs. He lost 9-0 in the Supreme Court, four innocent people to jail, overturned by the fifth circuit. He became in charge of everything. But here's my point. He's the biggest, most corrupt prosecutor you can have, with the most abusively biased one sided Democratic team. And he still has no goods. He convinced Mueller not to look at the dossier are. GIULIANI: Yes, and he knew because he was very close to Strzok. He was involved in this back in 2016 as Solomon has now uncovered. So, he had like a real vested interest in this, way beyond what's healthy for a prosecutor. Now, Mueller has some sort of a weird attachment to him, which I can't quite figure out, because Mueller, you know, has never been unethical prosecutor, and this guy is a textbook unethical prosecutor, and we are going to add to the chapters. I mean, offering a Ukrainian oligarch freedom? HANNITY: Two weeks. Two weeks. (CROSSTALK) GIULIANI: And the Ukrainian oligarch has more honor than you do, and says, I won't lie for you, and so does Manafort, and so does Corsi, and about five other people. This guy was pretty close. I can't say he did until he's investigated. HANNITY: Sounds like, Mr. Mayor, I'm going to say it. GIULIANI: Pretty darn close to suborning perjury. And that is a serious, serious crime. That's got to be fully investigated. And if he did it, he's got to be prosecuted. HANNITY: This prosecutorial tactic of offering a get-out-of-jail free card, if he tells us what we want to hear. This has got to stop because is there anything of greater value than your freedom and if you -- GIULIANI: You don't tell people -- you can offer a get out of jail card if somebody tells you their very version and it works. But you can't give them -- SEKULOW: But you'd have evidence to support it. GIULIANI: Like Dershowitz said, you can -- they can sing, but you can't compose for them. HANNITY: Jay, last word. GIULIANI: What he was doing is composing for them. SEKULOW: Here's the part of this. Sean, this is the story. The Democrats lost. The president of the country won, and the case is closed. There is nothing left in this case. GIULIANI: Mean. HANNITY: Wait a minute, Jay, I have a follow-up to that. How important is it, though? Because we did have a Russian dossier. It was paid for. It was used to influence the voters in 2016, and it was used as the basis of a FISA application, and we now know that it was unverifiable. And guys like Jim Comey and others signed it. And, by the way -- SEKULOW: Chapter -- the new volume starts now. The investigation of the investigators starts now. And that's the new story. GIULIANI: It's much more serious than these phony allegations because are real -- I guarantee you, Sean, there were real crimes. SEKULOW: Absolutely. GIULIANI: Like I used to prosecute. Real ones, and they could be really big. I'm not sure how high they go, but they go pretty darn high. It'd better be investigated so that it doesn't happen again. SEKULOW: No, it's going to be investigated. And we're going to find out. GIULIANI: I believe it will be. HANNITY: All right. I want to say to both of you, and this is important to know. This was a very hard job that both of you had. This was -- you had the entire media industrial complex spreading lies and conspiracies. You had to counter that. You had Democrats spreading and conspiracies. You had more misinformation that I think I've ever seen in my life. And I think this is an important moment for this great republic that we have, and had this gone the other way, this would have destroyed the greatest country God gave man. It is that serious and it is that deep, the corruption, the abuse of power. Thank you. SEKULOW: It's been our honor to do this. HANNITY: All right. Thank you. Mueller's confusing contradictory testimony about obstruction, that was not the only glaring inconsistency from the hearing. In fact, there were many puzzling moments. Many are now wondering what role, if any, Mueller played in the special counsel investigation. Here with more reaction to today's hearing is the man you just saw. He is the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. Congressman Doug Collins, you know, I really wasn't worried about and Devin Nunes and Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz and Ratcliffe. I kind of felt confident on you guys. I've worried about some of the other Republicans. But I will tell you, I was impressed with everybody and I think you all did a great job. You in particular, sir. REP. DOUG COLLINS, R-GA.: Well, thanks. We actually worked on this, Sean. We knew it was. It was an important moment for our country. We believe in our country. We believe in freedom, and we believe in what we did today. And that is pointing out the truth and inconsistencies in this report. And that's what people needed to see today. HANNITY: Tell us your big takeaways from today, Congressman. And I've got to give you -- I have singled you out for special praise is because we were able to see and learn so much about this case that we hadn't previously known, because you single-handedly released the closed door testimony. We got to see your work, and Jim Jordan's work and Mark Meadows' work, and Devin Nunes' work and Ratcliff's work. And, boy, you guys behind the scenes when nobody was looking and no credit was given, wow, you laid the foundation for all of this happening today and I know because I've read those closed-door testimony hearings. And they were blockbuster. COLLINS: They were great. I think the takeaway today is pretty simple. Number one is what we started off with. We showed that collusion and conspiracy were the same thing, Mueller debunked it all. That is put to bed. There is no Democrat that can go out and say that, oh, I see collusion in plain sight. And it's the way Adam Schiff puts it, just lie. We can't do that anymore. Mueller put that to a complete rest today. The second thing is, when the Democrats did all of their tricks and there little flower points and said here was obstruction, he looked at them and said, I don't subscribe to your theory. That obstruction theory is blown. And then the third thing which I think is important which set something next level is he refused to talk about things actually in his report like the dossier, like the interviews of other people, while we know that he wouldn't talk about it, we do know that we're looking at the Inspector General Horowitz and we're looking at Mr. Durham. That is why this next level is so important because we know the rest is -- put to rest her. No obstruction. No charges. Definitely no collusion and no conspiracy which started this all, and now, we can get to what we've been talking about all along and which you've been championing as well. HANNITY: Well, now, as we said, the curtain has gone down. Act one is over. It's dead and buried. But this -- we better get this right, because there really was Russian interference, except it was bought and paid for. And we had people within the highest ranks of our government abused their power in an attempt to rig a presidential election and take down a duly elected president. Congressman Collins, we will not stop until they are held accountable. Thank you sir. Now, I can guarantee that probably all of you that watch this program, you are familiar with Fusion GPS. Remember, we've been reporting the basic fact. Hillary Clinton and the DNC, they funneled money through a law firm called Perkins Coie, by the way, in and of itself, they were trying to make it out to be a legal expense. It wasn't, because they went to Fusion GPS, which is an op research firm. And Fusion GPS then hired a foreign national. I thought foreign national weren't supposed to impact our elections. He's a former MI-6 spy. You know his name, Christopher Steele, who, by the way, himself, when push came to shove, in an interrogatory in Great Britain, he couldn't confirm his own dossier -- the one that was used to get warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, Trump transition and yes, the Trump presidency. Fusion GPS hired Steele to dig up Russian dirt, create the now infamous dirty dossier, filled with an unverifiable Russian lies. Hillary paid for it. The DNC paid for it. The FBI helped pay for it, and an oligarch helped pay for it. Amazing work if you can get four people to pay for the same lies. Fusion GPS is at the very center at the DOJ's ongoing real investigation into FISA abuse, which now appears to be premeditated FISA fraud committed against FISA judges. I'd love to hear from them, for the purpose of spying on a presidential campaign, transition team and president. In other words, also, we'll bring us to the origins of Mueller's witch hunt. According to multiple reports tonight, the contents of that dossier, very well be a key part of Russia's campaign to interfere with our elections. In other words, even \"The New York Times\" now recognizes that it was Russian dirt from the get-go, designed to impact the election. The whole dossier that Hillary played for was Russian disinformation, likely from the beginning, \"The New York Times\" said. During the hearing -- this is amazing. Robert Mueller didn't seem to know what Fusion GPS is. He also didn't know that Ronald Reagan had made an appointment for him. He also didn't know that one of Hillary's attorneys was on the team. With more she has done phenomenal work herself. Take a bow, Catherine Herridge in our Washington Bureau tonight. And you deserve props there were not many people in every news division in America that did the digging and the hard work you did. I want to tell people how I know you work so hard. Because it always turned out every one of my sources said, oh, I just spoke to Catherine. Oh, I talked to Catherine yesterday. Catherine Herridge has been asking the same questions. CATHERINE HERRIDGE, CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: You are making me embarrassed now. HANNITY: Well, I mean you did it on your own. We were all getting the information from me but you are working you are as off and I'm - you should be proud of your hard work, because you were standing alone looking for truth. I applaud you for it. HERRIDGE: I'm sure you would agree. I have always believed that the facts have a power all their own, and they can speak for themselves. Meantime Sean, today right out of the gate, Robert Mueller seem to got the Republicans ambition saying he would not address the origin of the FBI Russia Probe in 2016. So Congressman Devin Nunes has got key details on the table. By reading into the congressional record that the FBI probe began with a tip from a foreign politician, not an official - intelligence product from the so called \"Five Eyes\". The intelligence network that includes the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K. Another Republican pressed Mueller on a proceed double-standard. Multiple Trump team members, including Former Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort were prosecuted. But the mysterious professor Joseph Mifsud who planted the Russia-Clinton email story, apparently lied to the FBI with no consequences. (ROBERT MUELLER'S TESTIMONY) HERRIDGE: And you were right to spot light that the Former Special Counsel was not familiar with fusion GPS, the firm behind the Democrat funded dossier. And of course that matters, because it was used to secure surveillance warrants and multiple renewals. (ROBERT MUELLER'S TESTIMONY) HERRIDGE: My intelligence contacts report that it's standard for the Russians or any former intelligence service to collect information about both campaigns. So investigating the source of the dossier is like a counterintelligence 101 and a major gap in the Mueller report, Sean. HANNITY: All right, great reporting, Catherine Herridge. Take a bow tonight. You're ahead of the curve. HERRIDGE: Thank you. HANNITY: When so many of your colleagues in news divisions failed. Thank you. Here now more reaction. Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee. I want you just say something. Without the people I'm about to introduce this wouldn't have happened. Devin Nunes Congressman Jim Jordan, Congressman Matt Gaetz, he is not here, but I'll speak for him Congressman Mark Meadows. Thank you all for being with us. I get your general impressions and where do we go from here because the really was a whole lot to the story that I am shocked Robert Mueller apparently knew nothing about Devin Nunes. REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALIF.: Well, if you go through and look at all the questions that the House Intelligence Committee was asked, of course there was no collusion of course there was no obstruction. Doug Collins Judiciary Committee and Jim Jordan did a great job with that. But what we ask are very specific questions about the origin of the investigation. The Steele dossier all the things that you've been covering for years. I think we were a little taken back that not only would Mr. Mueller not answer. He seemed to not know at times. They were very basic questions. HANNITY: Devin, I've kind of - Devin I've got to tell you something. He's either not watching the show or he's not remembering it, because you are right. NUNES: But not only that, he also must not have read anything of the documentation about how this investigation began. I mean, to not know or want to talk about Joseph Mifsud was really baffling to me. HANNITY: You know, Jim Jordan, you'd be a very good talk show host, because you have an ability to list things that I envy. And I'm pretty good at my list. So I'm a little but I watched you today, and you really hit a very important nerve here. I want you to explain to people the significance of where you went. REP. JIM JORDON, R-OH: The guy who started it all lies three times for the FBI on February 10th, 2017. They don't go find him with anything and they don't go finding him and get a second interview. But anyone associated with the Trump campaign who gave a false statement gets charged with the crime in 13 Russian names ever heard off get charged with the crime. The guy who puts it all emotion lies to you and you don't do a darn thing. All these today in my mind underscored something that you've been talking out, Dev has been talking about, Matt always been talking about. All that underscored why the investigation Bill Barr, John Durham and also Michael Horowitz investigation as so darn important because those go to the heart of this when it all started 2016. HANNITY: Matt Gaetz, I thought you had a great line of questioning yourself today. But what we are really learning is you fight for the Freedom Caucus and a few that decided to inform themselves and kept digging and digging and digging and doing hard work behind the scenes in these close door interviews. You, Mark, Devin, and Jim. We wouldn't be here today. We learned a lot on those close doors sessions and how hard you all were working when nobody was looking. GAETZ: Thank you, Sean. I'm reminded that just yesterday Adam Schiff said that Robert Mueller would breathe life into the Mueller report today. And instead what we saw was Robert Mueller sucked the life out of the impeachment movement altogether. It is dead and over. I suspect that you'll see even more Americans reject this. Really this terrible distraction for the country. We also have to deal with Robert Mueller's evolving purview. And I think this really showed the bias and the double standard. When people who supported Trump lied, he threw the book at him. When people like Christopher Steele who hated Trump lied when Glenn Simpson was engaging in Russians, Robert Mueller was hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. I don't understand why it's in Robert Mueller's purview to write 3500 words - he did not write this report, okay? I don't know how many times he read it. The fusion GPS issue that you've been sighting. Fusion GPS itself is referenced in a story that in a footnote in the report. So it's very clear Robert didn't write it. And I don't think he really understood it today. HANNITY: This is the question that's most often asked by people that we appreciate. Watched this TV Show that you have made the show number one. I want to ask this question. They asked me all the time, and I'll ask you the same question. Devin Nunes will the people that have been involved in this abuse of power and corruption, will they be held accountable? Hilary get away with a rigged investigation a dirty dossier pre meditated lying fraud on FISA courts an attempt to undo a presidential election with lies and conspiracy theories? We'll start with Devin. NUNES: So remember, Sean. We've made some criminal referrals. There are some that are very easy criminal referrals just like Matt Gaetz was saying. If you lie to Congress or instructive Congress's investigation, those are simple. Those are the easy ones. To get to the bottom and dig into this, like we've been doing for three years is much more complicated. It's more complicated to prove conspiracy. It's a higher standard. So that will be up to the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut and ultimately the Attorney General to see what it is if they can get to the bottom of the origin of this investigation and whether or not there was FISA abuses that were done as a conspiracy and whether or not intelligence was manipulated as a conspiracy? HANNITY: But we know the answer. We know what happened. Jim, will they be held accountable? JORDON: Yes the people that Bill Barr said was the crisis in leadership at the upper rest on the FBI. Comey, McKay, Baker Strzok and Page. Comey was fired. Andy McKay lied three times under all fired. Jim Baker Chief Counsel was demoted in left was under an investigation by the Justice Department. Lisa Page demoted in left and of course Peter Strzok the lead agent on both of these key cases that the Hilary case and the Trump Russia case. Peter Strzok deputy had a counterintelligence demoted in fire. Those are the five key people. That's where the investigation should focus as well as these origins. That's what Bill Barr and John Durham are looking into. HANNITY: Matt Gaetz. GAETZ: Sea, if there was any bomb shell today it was a consequence of Devin Nunes's questioning that exposed that this investigation did not begin when Robert Mueller says it began. There were earlier even more corrupt origins and folks that I think are sleeping too well tonight. Brennan and Clapper people associated with the Obama Administration-- HANNITY: And Comey. GAETZ: - who were stirring this up well. Comey and McKay frankly are lower hanging fruit because it's so obvious their leaks - but that conspiracy that Devin outlined goes back to Brennan and Clapper. HANNITY: I want everybody to know something here. I'm half kidding and I'm half not kidding. These three men, led Mark Meadows who is not here and Lindsey Graham we're going to talk to in a minute. You guys put your heads on a chopping block, and Chuck Schummer once famously said, you take on the Intel Committee they're going to get. Frankly, anyone of you, maybe even me, we could have had a pre-dawn raid, because that's how corrupt this guy. Thank you for what you did for your country tonight. This is important stuff. Thank you. Earlier today, Senator Lindsey Graham issued a statement read \"After today's hearing - and for the good of the country. I hope this is the end of the Mueller report. Now it's time to find out how this debacle started and went so far\". Senator Graham joins us now. Your question I always go back to you asked Attorney General Barr, you confident Mueller had everything he needed to get the job done at the time? President never invoked executive privilege once, I don't know 1.5 million documents. Everybody was accessible. My question is, Hilary gets away with a fixed investigation when she committed crimes? Do the people involved in lying to a FISA court consciously do they get away with it? The people that tried to influence a presidential election, get away with it? And people that tried to undo that election get away with it Senator? Or are you going to make sure that doesn't happen? SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: I'm more determined today after this hearing to get to the bottom of it. The question, did Hilary get let off because of the people investigating her wanted her to win and Trump to lose, was the reason that she wasn't prosecuted was because of political decision, political motivation. All the things are very important. One thing I can tell you after today, the Mueller report is a name only. And the idea you say-- HANNITY: Is that a Wiseman report? GRAHAM: We'll see, but it clearly wasn't the Mueller report. It's just a name. I had more to do with the Mueller report then probably he did. Do you know what bothers me a lot? People around Bob Mueller knew he was in a weakened state. This guy served in Vietnam, got wounded, done a lot of great things for the country. He should not have been called. HANNITY: Senator, let me agree with you. When the Attorney General agreed to the joint statement, Attorney General, I said at the time, he did a favor to Bob Mueller. The Attorney General was warning that this was going to be a spectacle. It seems like the only person that understood and tried to prevent it was the one that was being accused of trying to rig it was the Attorney General knew that this would be a disaster for Mueller. And you are right. His background was one of a hero. The people that allowed this that used him, the politicians on that committee, and the people on that group that hired and did all this, and he knew nothing and ran the show without them, they are the ones that did this to his reputation. GRAHAM: The hatred for Trump knows no boundaries. They used this man and one of the reasons I have told people early on I was not going to call Mueller because the report speaks for itself. But I was told by people close to Bob Mueller that he really shouldn't have to go through this. I've been asked everyday -- HANNITY: Senator, I knew he wasn't capable of this. I am a stupid talk show host. I was told repeatedly that he is not up to the task. GRAHAM: Here's the point. I've been asked for three months, why don't you want to call Mueller? I bet you nobody will ask me that tomorrow. A letter was sent to me by every Democrat on the Judiciary Committee in the Senate. Why don't you call Mueller? Nobody is going ask me to that tomorrow. Here's what I want to say. Donald Trump is stronger tonight than any time in his presidency. The need to find out what happened was greater than it was before. It's clear that Bob Mueller was not in charge of his investigation. And like every American who cares about the rule we need to find out how this started and why it went so long? HANNITY: Senator, we need the Senator Graham that changed the course of the Cavanaugh Hearing to take control of this. Your country needs you. This is important. This republic came dangerously close to allowing lies and conspiracy theories. Few powerful people don't see a dually elected President. Your country needs you. That's just the fact. GRAHAM: Well their time is coming. The President has gone through hell for two and half years and nobody else could have taken that but him. HANNITY: I know, I agree with you. GRAHAM: He is stronger today. I don't see why did it. They've tried to ruin his family's life and he's cut his nails. But those who engaged in the FISA court abuse and I think fraud it's their time. The only way you will ever stop this in the future is to make people clarify. HANNITY: Your committee is going to be crucial Senator. I believe you. Thank you for what you are doing to get to the truth. Joining us now is Author - this book has been on \"The New York Times\" list for eternity. It's week number nine or ten. Number one best seller \"Unfreedom of the Press\". \"The Great One\" Mark Levin. Now this also the number one show on Fox on Sunday nights \"Life, Liberty & Levin\". I had to talk this man into doing radio. This is a fact. I made him do it. He didn't want to. He was reluctant and resistant. \"Great One\" what I love about you is your brain more than anything else. You are a great constitutional scholar. I worried about a republic after I saw today morning I have but at any point and I've been worried for a while. MARK LEVIN, \"UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS\" AUTHOR: Now let me do a little summation here. As far as Robert Mueller goes, I'm on two minds with Robert Mueller, know he was in no condition to testify, but on the other hand, he was in no condition to be a Special Counsel. And he should not have accepted the job and Rod Rosenstein should have never offered him the job. The victim here is not Mueller. The victim is the President of the United States and all the other people who are around him. I want people to keep something in mind about this 448 page report. It is a prosecutor's brief. It was their best shot. There is no reply report by the President that was permitted. There was no contrary witnesses no contrary documents no contrary evidence. No cross examinations, no challenges of any type. So this is a really Soviet style process we are going through. And I want to thank the Democrats, because they will reveal themselves as the clowns that they truly are. They've impeached themselves today and forever more. If the Democrats were truly interested Mr. Schiff which you said over and over again in overwhelming Russian involvement in our campaign, then why the hell didn't you call Barack Obama and Joe Biden to testify? Why the hell didn't you call Clapper and Brennan and Lynch and Comey and Hillary Clinton? They are in charge of our government. They are the ones who allowed the Russians to have overwhelming influence in our campaign, and they kept their mouth shut, because they thought Hilary would win. And they didn't want to tank that election. Where is Barrack Obama today? His own some ship in the Caribbean I suppose? Where is Hilary Clinton where any of them? Now that's that. Now I want to talk about obstruction of justice. These liberal Democrats who ran this operation are such incompetent boobs. They cited three criminal obstruction statutes that don't apply. Now that people have studied this. Moreover, what document exactly did the President with held? None. What witness did the President from testifying? Not one. What investigator or prosecutor did the President fire? Not one. What resources to the President withhold? Not one. No conspiracy, no obstruction. Let's talk a little bit more about obstruction I mentioned this when you show before. HANNITY: Mark, we got about 45 seconds. Go ahead sir. LEVIN: Well, it's too late then. Let's talk about Mueller's purview. Everything is outside Mueller's purview. Outside Hilary Clinton, the DNC, Fusion GPS, Christopher Steele, Russia's role and Steele dossier, the FISA applications, McKay's lynch, Strozk leaks, Comey leaks, McKay's coup attempt. Outside of the purview. Rosenstein's conflict of interest. FBI placing spies on the Trump campaign. Obama Administration's unmasking of American citizens. The Obama Administration failed to stop the Russians. All outside the purview. But Manafort taxes-- HANNITY: Oh we never heard the end of it? LEVIN: All right, I'm done brother. HANNITY: Mark, there are only a couple of us that put our neck out from the beginning on this. You were one of them. Thank you. \"The Great one\" Mark Levin, Sunday night Number one show, book number one. Everything is number one. Judge Jeannine is ready to go. Gregg Jarrett and Sara Carter they're next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: I do have a big announcement. We will have an exclusive interview. The President reacts to all of what happened today and so much more talk about 2020 and of course Democratic socialists. For more reaction to Mueller's testimony author of the upcoming book \"Radicals Resistance and Revenge\" the host of \"Justice\" Judge Jeannine Pirro that book will be number. Also, another book that's going to be number one, Greg's Jarrett's book \"Witch Hunt\" which is coming out a follow up to his best seller. And Fox News Investigative Report Sara Carter. All of you are part of what I call an ensemble team to this show, I guess I get credit because there is my name on the stupid show, but really, honestly, it was a team effort. All of you worked so hard. This was really an effort. I'm peeling - Sara what do I call it? The layers of the onion. SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR: The layers of the onion. Yes. HANNITY: And I said - I told that we can't stop all of you deserve credit. Sara I'll let you start from there. Your thoughts? CARTER: Oh, well so today's hearing. The Democrats actually did a favor for the American people. Because with absolute certainty now after what we saw today, there needs to be at DOJ and there is a DOJ investigation at the beginning of this Russia investigation. Look, Sean, what we saw today was actually painful to watch. It was painful to watch Robert Mueller stumble around, not able to answer the question. What we saw, as a nation, was how flawed this report was. The next step, we know there's not going to be an impeachment. They are not going to move towards impeachment. They just can't. This country must move towards an investigation that routes out those people that started this conspiracy, this disinformation campaign against President Trump. It needs to go all the way to the top. We need to know who weaponized the intelligence and who targeted President Trump once and for all and hopefully John Durham will do that and Attorney General William Barr. HANNITY: We don't get to the bottom of a Judge and you're opening monologues scare me some days, because you are so accurate, that's why. Because you're right, and you are passionate about it. If we don't get to the bottom of this, this will happen again. A great exception might be, they might be successful. And that means the country is over. JUDGE JEANNINE PIRRO, \"RADICALS, RESISTENCE AND REVENGE\" AUTHOR: You are absolutely right, Sean. The problem is, they are trying to remake America. What we saw today was struggling, stumbling Robert Mueller. This guy was nothing more than a shield for the deep state of Trump hating, Hilary loving lawyers who slapped his name on a report and tried to change the presumption of innocence. This has been happening for a while. HANNITY: Only because I poorly managed my time. I've got to get Gregg in here. And then I'll promise will bring you all back tomorrow and obviously on the weekend. Gregg. GREGG JARRETT, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, it was an important because Americans saw as the curtain was peeled back and this fraudulent investigation was exposed. The great and powerful Mueller was not, he was oblivious to basic facts, uninformed about the law. He wasn't in charge of this investigation, he didn't write the report, he didn't sit in on interviews. Who was in charge? Andrew Weissmann was in charge. HANNITY: Right. You three have been amazing, thank you. More \u201cHannity.\u201d (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Only touching the surface. The President, Donald Trump, will join us for an exclusive interview, reacting to all of the events from today, the conspiracy theories, the lies, the propaganda, the misinformation. Media is dead. The mob exists. We'll never be a part of it. We are going to get to the truth. We are going to hold them accountable. Let not your heart be troubled. We'll have the President tomorrow night.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The elected prime minister of Tibet's government-in-exile, Lobsang Sangay, says a grand religious gathering starting Wednesday in Washington will allow expatriate Tibetans a right denied their brethren inside China: to meet their spiritual leader. The Dalai Lama arrived in Washington on Tuesday for an 11-day Buddhist ritual, known as a kalachakra, that organizers expect will draw upward of 10,000 followers a day from America, Asia and Europe. His visit begins Wednesday with celebrations to mark his 76th birthday. He also will meet with lawmakers during his stay, his longest in the U.S. capital. The White House has yet to announce whether he will meet with President Barack Obama. Such a meeting would anger China, which accuses the Dalai Lama of seeking independence for Tibet, although he says he wants only autonomy for his homeland within China. In May, the Dalai Lama relinquished his leadership of Tibet's government-in-exile, giving up the political power that he and his predecessors have wielded over Tibetans for hundreds of years. Although he remains the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, his decision to abdicate is one of the biggest upheavals in the community since the Chinese crackdown led him to flee in 1959 into exile in India. The exile government will now to be led by a 43-year-old Harvard legal scholar, Sangay, who won an election in April. Sangay grew up in a refugee camp, the son of a Tibetan Buddhist monk who took up arms against China after his monastery was destroyed. Sangay, who takes up his post next month, told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday that continuing Chinese repression inside Tibet is a tragedy and urged continuing U.S. support for Tibetan autonomy. In recent months, Chinese authorities have been accused of a crackdown at a prominent Tibetan monastery in Sichuan province, where in March a 21-year-old monk set himself on fire to protest Chinese rule. Sangay said that while the kalachakra was not staged in Washington for political reasons, he said the gathering was an expression of a desire shared by Tibetans inside China. \"We are here to be blessed by His Holiness. We are able to do so here, in the free world, but inside Tibet we are not able to do this,\" he said. \"Tibetans inside Tibet have this same basic right.\" \"We are entitled to have our freedom, and we shall have our freedom,\" he said. Sangay asserted that his election by Tibetan exiles grants him more recognition as Tibet's political leader than the communist party's secretary inside the Chinese-controlled territory. But he acknowledged it will take time for him to establish his credibility among Tibetans as he assumes responsibilities previously carried by the man worshipped by his people as a living deity, the Dalai Lama. For their part, Chinese leaders, who for decades have reviled the Dalai Lama as a separatist, have promised to hold negotiations on Tibet only with representatives of the monk. The discussions have gone on for nine fruitless rounds already. \"Whether they want to talk to me or not is secondary,\" said Sangay. \"The primary issue is to solve the issue of Tibet.\"",

      "author": "Peter Morici",
      "content": " Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Baltimore Sun. President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0has presented his first offer on immigration reform \u2014 an\u00a0exhaustive list of measures\u00a0to better seal our terribly porous borders, establish internal security and reassert federal authority over renegade sanctuary cities. It includes\u00a0conservative wish list\u00a0items like a wall along the Mexican border that\u2019s too expensive and whose objectives could be better accomplished, for example, through more resources for electronic surveillance. However, the\u00a0Democrats\u00a0often behave as if they prefer a border with the holes of a colander to win cheap electoral advantage. Seen as a first offer to very difficult negotiating partners, Mr. Trump\u2019s principles are best evaluated in terms of what is likely, because the Dreamers are hostage to this process, and what is needed, because the present system of granting even permanent legal visas is broken. By endorsing the kinds of reforms proposed by Republican\u00a0Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue\u00a0of Georgia, President Trump is offering Congress an opportunity to better consider how new arrivals can contribute to national prosperity. The United States has about 45 million immigrants\u00a0and annually welcomes 1.5 million. About one quarter are here illegally, and in recent years, their number has hardly changed. Declining birth rates abroad and tougher border enforcement have already slowed the inflow. Canada and Australia face challenges similar to ours \u2014 falling birth rates, skill shortages and societies defined by waves of immigrants from Europe and Asia \u2014 and both place priority on the needs of their economies. In contrast to other industrialized countries, the United States places greater emphasis on family reunification.\u00a0Green Cards\u00a0are granted automatically to spouses, minor children and parents of U.S. citizens. Subject to annual limits, entry is granted to other relatives of citizens, legal immigrants and refugees, and those who can contribute to economic growth. Ultimately,\u00a0about 65 percent of immigrant visas are based on family ties and 15 percent on employment. The remainder is mostly through a lottery for underrepresented countries. The Cotton-Perdue bill\u00a0would limit family reunification visas to minor children and spouses, end the lottery and focus on workforce needs. Potential economic growth is determined by the sum of productivity and labor force growth. Both have fallen,\u00a0causing many economists to conclude 2 percent growth\u00a0is inevitable. However, missing from this is a discussion of labor force quality. Innovations in robotics, artificial intelligence and other areas indicate broad opportunities to boost productivity, but American businesses face\u00a0shortages of skilled technicians\u00a0and engineers to fully exploit those. Currently, immigrant workers tend to be concentrated among two groups:\u00a0those with less than a high school education and those with more than a four-year college degree. Immigrants tend to be older than the native population\u00a0and more than half qualify for means-tested entitlements, creating obvious frictions. Downward pressure on wages of lower skilled workers is measurable, but overall the impact of immigration on growth is positive. Technology-intensive activities are greatly enhanced by the influx of high-skilled immigrants, and\u00a0those benefits overwhelm the costs imposed by lower wages on unskilled workers. Immigration stresses social cohesion, especially among the working class. New arrivals compete for jobs and often eat different foods, practice different religions and have different family and community traditions. Folks in small towns and rural counties, riveted by the loss of factories and consolidation in agriculture, increasingly rely on those very things to cope. And\u00a0they feel alienated by the ethnic diversity and libertine values of larger cities. Those are important reasons why they don\u2019t leave for educational and employment opportunities in diverse urban settings and have abandoned the Democratic Party. Liberals in big cities \u2014 especially in the media and universities who shape public perceptions \u2014 dismiss middle-American ambivalence as ill-informed, xenophobic and racist. After all, the urban elite work harmoniously in Manhattan office buildings, California technology centers and the like where cultural affinities that bring together professional groups tend to overwhelm ethnic differences among highly educated adults \u2014 if nothing else, professional schools like mine socialize students to common metropolis values and behavior. What works for Ivy League and elite state university graduates does not rhyme well for ordinary working folks in America\u2019s interior. That\u2019s why those common people elected Donald Trump to the dismay of urban intellectuals. As Barrack Obama so often lectured during his first years, elections should have consequences, and now the will of the common folks should be served.",

      "content": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee has raised a record $90 million in private donations to pay for the steep costs\u00a0of next weekend\u2019s festivities. It's the most any president has raised for their inauguration and it outpaces the amount collected by President Barack Obama\u2019s two inaugural committees - $55 million in 2009 and $43 million in 2013, the Associated Press reported. Donations include $500,000 from Chevron and $1 million given by Boeing. AT&T says it has made both cash and in-kind donations, including quintupling phone capacity on the National Mall. DEMOCRATIC REP. LEWIS: TRUMP NOT A 'LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT' The committee has 90 days after the Jan. 20 inauguration to reveal the rest of the donors. Trump\u2019s committee has declined to provide details on how it\u2019s aiming to spend the money. However, lead inaugural planner Tom Barrack said this week the team wants to avoid a \u201ccircus-like atmosphere\u201d in favor of a more \u201cback to work\u201d mindset that surrounds Trump \u201cwith the soft sensuality of the place.\u201d Trump himself promised the event would be a \"very, very elegant day\" with \"massive crowds.\" Trump\u00a0is holding three\u00a0inaugural\u00a0balls; Obama had 10 balls at his first\u00a0inaugural.\u00a0Trump's\u00a0team also hopes to keep its parade to 90 minutes. The longest parade, with 73 bands and 59 floats, lasted more than four and half hours, at Dwight Eisenhower's first\u00a0inauguration, in 1953 Spokesman Boris Epshteyn said the\u00a0inaugural\u00a0committee is \"fully focused on organizing world-class events that honor our nation's tremendous history and reach every corner of the globe.\" Any excess money\u00a0raised\u00a0will be donated to charity. Steve Kerrigan, CEO for Obama's\u00a0inaugural\u00a0committee in 2013 and chief of staff in 2009, said the $90\u00a0million\u00a0fundraising haul looks like overkill. \"I can't imagine how they are going to spend that amount of money \u2014 and why they would even keep\u00a0raising\u00a0money,\" he said. \"We planned the two largest\u00a0inaugurations\u00a0in the history of our country and we never spent anywhere near that.\" HEAD OF DC NATIONAL GUARD TO STEP DOWN DURING INAUGURATION While a big share of the\u00a0cost\u00a0is\u00a0covered\u00a0by the private donations, taxpayers provide a considerable amount as well. They're on the hook, for example, to\u00a0cover\u00a0the close to $5\u00a0million\u00a0cost\u00a0of building the bunting-decorated 10,000 square-foot platform built on the West Front of the Capitol for the swearing-in. The public also pays security\u00a0costs\u00a0for an event that brings together a big chunk of the U.S. political leadership, hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans and a fair share of protesters. Because those expenses are scattered throughout the federal budget, it's hard to get a fix on just how much the day will\u00a0cost. Some tabs are spelled out: $1.25\u00a0million\u00a0for the Joint Congressional Committee on\u00a0Inaugural\u00a0Ceremonies, which is responsible for the swearing-in ceremony,\u00a0inaugural\u00a0luncheon and review of troops, and $2.5\u00a0million\u00a0for overtime for U.S. Capitol Police. More than 5,000 active duty service members and 7,500 National Guard members will take part, too. In 2009, spending by the military's\u00a0inaugural\u00a0joint task force and the Defense Department totaled $21.6\u00a0million. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser says the city expects to spend at least $30\u00a0million, with the federal government reimbursing the full amount. So far, Congress has appropriated $19\u00a0million, and the city will go back to Congress after the swearing-in to ask for the rest. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "content": "NEW YORK \u2013 Immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, but were protected from deportation by President Barrack Obama, are being warned by some advocates to make sure they are not traveling abroad when Donald Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20. Some advocates, lawyers and universities are concerned that Trump might immediately rescind an Obama program that had allowed these young immigrants to work and travel for humanitarian, educational or employment purposes. That could lead, they fear, to some people traveling abroad being barred from re-entering the U.S. \"We are recommending all travel be completed by or before Jan. 20 in the event laws or procedures experience a drastic change,\" said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. \"We wouldn't want to expose them to an uncertain situation should they not be allowed back to the U.S.\" Trump made illegal immigration the cornerstone of his campaign, promising to build a wall along the Mexican border and deport millions of people living in the country illegally. His actual plans, though, have yet to be revealed. Recently, he has said he wants to focus on people who have committed crimes. During a recent Time magazine interview, Trump expressed sympathy for the 741,000 people in Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which started in 2012. \"We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud,\" Trump said. \"They got brought here at a very young age, they've worked here, they've gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they're in never-never land because they don't know what's going to happen.\" Advocates are still being cautious. Nancy Lopez-Ramirez, a 20-year-old student born in Mexico who is planning a trip there as part of a City College of New York class, said she is glad the group is returning by Jan. 15. \"My mom is like 'I am concerned with you not coming back, I want you to be able to come back,'\" she said. \"It is nerve-wracking but I think that at the end it is going to be worth it,\" said the political-science student, who was brought to the U.S. when she was 4. City College, part of the City University of New York, is one of the institutions advising students in the DACA program to return before Inauguration Day. So is California State University, which told administrators to tell participants in the program \"that if they are outside of the United States as of January 20, 2017, there is no assurance they will be allowed to return to the U.S.\" Trump can rescind the promised protection right away through an \"operational memo\" because Obama implemented it through one, said William Stock, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. He said the program's participants should not consider traveling overseas unless they absolutely need to. U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Anthony Bucci said his agency \"cannot speculate\" when he was asked how long would it take for CBP officers to deny entry to the U.S. to program participants if Trump eliminated the protection. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services records said that as of Dec. 31, 2015, about 22,340 people in the DACA program were approved for the \"parole\" that allows them to travel outside the U.S. Trump called the program an \"illegal amnesty\" during his campaign. Tatyana Kleyn, an associate professor at City College who organized the upcoming Mexico trip, said interest in it actually surged among students after the presidential election. \"So right now our bus fits 18 and we are bringing 20,\" she said. \"It feels like a last chance.\"",

CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: \u00a0I\u2019m Chris Wallace. Inauguration week is here. \u00a0As President-elect Trump deals with an unverified dossier linking him to the Kremlin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENT-ELECT: \u00a0I think it's a disgrace, and that\u2019s something that Germany would have done and did do. WALLACE: \u00a0We\u2019ll discuss Mr. Trump's testy relationship with the intelligence community when we sit down with Vice President-elect Mike Pence just five days before he is sworn into office. And we\u2019ll find out why the nation's spy chiefs briefed Mr. Trump on the Russian rumors in an exclusive interview with CIA Director John Brennan. \u00a0We\u2019ll also ask him about the hot spots the Trump team faces, from ISIS to China. \u00a0John Brennan, only on \"Fox News Sunday\". Plus, the politics of why Hillary Clinton didn't win the election are still playing out. REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALI., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: \u00a0The American people are owed the truth. WALLACE: \u00a0We\u2019ll ask our Sunday panel about the Justice Department inspector general investigating FBI Director James Comey for possible misconduct. And our power player of the week, the head of the presidential inaugural committee on pulling off this week\u2019s big event. TOM BARRACK, HEAD OF PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL COMMITTEE: \u00a0It\u2019s quite (INAUDIBLE) putting on the Olympics in 60 days. WALLACE: \u00a0All, right now, on \"Fox News Sunday.\" (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: \u00a0And hello again from Fox News in Washington. Donald Trump takes the oath of office in just five days, but on the brink of his presidency, questions about Russia's involvement in the election won't go away. \u00a0Today, we want to discuss that and of the agenda with the man who will be sworn in next Friday as vice president. We are honored to be joined here in studio by Mike Pence. Mr. Vice President-elect, welcome back to his \"Fox News Sunday\".\" MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT: \u00a0Thanks, Chris. \u00a0It's good to be here. \u00a0It\u2019s an exciting week. WALLACE: \u00a0Democratic Congressman John Lewis, one of the icons of the civil rights movements, says that he is not going to attend the inauguration, and he has explained why. \u00a0Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOHN LEWIS, D-GEORGIA: \u00a0I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0What's your reaction to Congressman Lewis? PENCE: \u00a0Donald Trump won this election fair and square, thirty of 50 states, more counties than any Republican since Ronald Reagan, and the American people know that. \u00a0And, while I have great respect for John Lewis, and for his contributions, particularly with the civil rights movement. I was deeply disappointed to see someone of his stature question the legitimacy of Donald Trump's election as president and say he's not attending the inauguration, and I hope he reconsiders both positions. \u00a0You know, we'd even had recounts in this election where the numbers for the president-elect had actually gone up. \u00a0There's no question about the legitimacy of this election, and for John Lewis to make those statements is deeply disappointing. This is also -- it's disappointing, too, because I truly do believe this is a time when the American people should be celebrating the peaceful transition of power. \u00a0That's what this week is really all about, Chris, and to know that four living presidents will be on the stage acknowledging that peaceful transition of power, the world will be watching, will hear the first remarks that Donald will make as president of the United States in his inaugural address. I just -- I hope that John Lewis, and some others who have joined his plans to take a pass on the inauguration, will rethink that, will be with us and will celebrate this extraordinary moment in the life of our nation and the life of democracy. WALLACE: \u00a0I like to ask you as well -- you talked about Lewis\u2019 comments about Mr. Trump. \u00a0But also, I\u2019d also like to ask about Mr. Trump's comments about Mr. Lewis. \u00a0I want to put up this tweet, because in response, the president-elect called John Lewis \"all talk, talk, talk, no action.\" Can he really say that about the man who got his head cracked open walking across the Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, on Bloody Sunday, \"all talk, no action\"? PENCE: \u00a0Well -- WALLACE: \u00a0Do you think that's appropriate? PENCE: \u00a0I think -- I think Donald Trump has the right to defend himself. \u00a0When someone of John Lewis' stature, someone who is not only an icon in the civil rights movement, but also someone who by virtue of his sacrifice on that day that we know as Bloody Sunday, he crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge and he suffered that abuse and it was -- it was true that that the voting rights -- for someone to use his stature to use terms like this is not a legitimate president, it\u2019s just -- it's just deeply disappointing to me, and I hope he reconsiders it. But what Donald Trump was talking about their was literally generations of failed policies coming out of Washington, D.C., that have failed to many families and too many cities across this country. \u00a0I will tell you, Donald Trump is a man who is profoundly impatient with failure. \u00a0And you saw in the campaign, he went to major cities in this country and said we are going to bring safety to our streets. \u00a0We\u2019re going to bring school choice to our children. \u00a0We\u2019re going to bring jobs and opportunities to our cities. You remember that great line \"what the heck do you have to lose?\" \u00a0He\u2019s committed to being president of all the people in this country and to bring new jobs and prosperity in ways that the failed liberal policies of the last several generations have not. WALLACE: \u00a0Let me pick up on another controversy this week, because Mr. Trump has been going after the intelligence community, especially after they briefed him, and it became a public that they had briefed him both as unverified oppo research that the Kremlin allegedly put together on him. \u00a0On Friday, Mr. Trump sent these tweets, \"Probably released by \u2018intelligence\u2019,\" intelligence in quotes, \"even knowing there is no proof, and never will be.\" Does the president-elect really believe that the intelligence community is trying to undercut him and does he stand by his comparison of those tactics to Nazi Germany? PENCE: \u00a0Well, I think -- and obviously, the briefing that the president-elect and I received a week ago was a classified briefing and I can't comment on anything that happened there. WALLACE: \u00a0Well, the intelligence community has -- PENCE: \u00a0I never will. \u00a0But -- WALLACE: \u00a0They have verified that they did brief him on this oppo research. PENCE: \u00a0But the very fact that a few organizations, not this one, trafficked in opposition research and this salacious garbage I think was deeply troubling to millions of Americans, and from -- WALLACE: \u00a0What about the intelligence community? PENCE: \u00a0-- from whatever the source, and we don't know what the source was that put this into the traffic. \u00a0I know that the Director of National Intelligence said that it had been -- this information had been his floating around for months. It -- I think the president-elect and I, it was an act of your responsibility by a handful of news organizations to actually traffic in and pay attention to these materials. \u00a0And again, I think the American people saw for what it was, and our focus is going forward. \u00a0When you see the team that the president-elect has assembled in the course of this transition, particularly when it comes to national security, in General Mattis and in Senator Dan Coats, and in Mike Pompeo, you're going to see an effort to reinvigorate our national security, national intelligence, and the president is going to see to that from day one. WALLACE: \u00a0Let's talk about policy going forward, because the president-elect's seemed to suggest in an interview this weekend with The Wall Street Journal that he might dramatically change relations with Russia, and in fact lift sanctions against Russia if they begin to cooperate with us on ISIS and other areas. \u00a0I want to put a quote from that interview. Mr. Trump said, \"If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody\u2019s doing some really great things?\" How quickly might he end sanctions on Russia? PENCE: \u00a0I think -- I think the president-elect has made it very clear that we have a terrible relationship with Russia right now, and that's not all our own doing, but it really is a failure of American diplomacy in successive administrations. \u00a0And what the president-elect is determined to do is explore the possibility of better relations. \u00a0We have a common enemy in ISIS, the ability to work with Russia to confront, hunt down, and destroy ISIS at its source represents an enormously important priority of this incoming administration. But I think what the American people like about Donald Trump is he someone who can sit down, roll the sleeves up, and make a deal. \u00a0And I think what you're hearing in his reflections, whether it\u2019d be with Russia, whether it\u2019d be with China, whether it\u2019d be with other countries in the world is that we are going to reengage. \u00a0We are going to put America first. \u00a0We\u2019re going to put America\u2019s interest first. \u00a0But we\u2019re going to reengage in a way that advances America\u2019s interest in the world and advances peace. WALLACE: \u00a0I want to ask you about two very specific questions briefly so we can move on to domestic policy. \u00a0We now know that the Trump\u2019s national security advisor, Mike Flynn, had several conversations with the Russian ambassador, Kislyak, just at the time that President Obama was announcing new sanctions to the hacking of the U.S. election against Russia. Number one: did Mike Flynn ever discuss lifting sanctions in any of those conversations? \u00a0Do you know? PENCE: \u00a0I talked to General Flynn yesterday, and the conversations that took place at that time were not in any way related to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia or the expulsion of diplomats. WALLACE: \u00a0All right. Second question: can you flatly deny -- because this continues to be out there -- that there were any contact at any point in the campaign between Mr. Trump's associates and Russian operatives, including cutouts, as we know, about the hacking of the Democrats during the election? PENCE: \u00a0This -- you know, some of this derives from this opposition research memo, I guess, Chris, that made its way around the Internet. \u00a0There was about 24 hours were Michael Cohen, who has worked in the Trump Organization for many years, was accused for having a meeting in Prague, and finally, some news organizations did a little checking and found out that it was a different Michael Cohen. \u00a0And Michael himself has never actually been to Prague. WALLACE: \u00a0But I do want to ask you a question. PENCE: \u00a0He was at a baseball game with his son in August of last year. \u00a0So -- WALLACE: \u00a0I understand that. \u00a0But there\u2019s been other talk, and in fact, if I may, senators specifically asked FBI Director Comey about that. \u00a0He refused to answer. So, I\u2019m asking a direct question: was there any contact in any way between Trump or his associates and the Kremlin or cutouts they had? PENCE: \u00a0I joined this campaign in the summer, and I can tell you that all the contact by the Trump campaign and associates was with the American people. \u00a0We were fully engaged with taking his message to make America great again all across this country. \u00a0That\u2019s why he won in a landslide election. (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: \u00a0-- if there were any contacts, sir, I\u2019m just trying to get an answer. PENCE: \u00a0Yes. \u00a0I -- of course not. \u00a0Why would there be any contacts between the campaign? Chris, the -- this is all a distraction, and it's all part of a narrative to delegitimize the election and to question the legitimacy of this presidency, the American people see right through it. WALLACE: \u00a0OK. PENCE: \u00a0And truthfully, this is a week -- you know, I just sat on with our transition team in Washington yesterday, we have -- we've named 20 out of 21 of our candidate officials, probably have all of them named before we get to inauguration day. \u00a0The caliber and character of men and women that the president-elect has assembled, the hundreds and hundreds of interviews and conversations he himself has had, I think should be deeply inspiring to millions of Americans. \u00a0And they know when he raises his right hand on that inaugural platform this coming Friday, that he is going to be ready on day one to keep his promises to the American people to turn this country around. (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: \u00a0But let me ask you about this. \u00a0We\u2019ve got about three minutes and I\u2019m going to ask you three questions. \u00a0So, let's try to get them all in, OK? PENCE: \u00a0OK. WALLACE: \u00a0In a lightning round. Obamacare. PENCE: \u00a0Yes. WALLACE: \u00a0The president-elect he wants to see repeal and replace basically at the same time. \u00a0Here he is in his press conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: \u00a0It will be repealed and replaced. \u00a0It will be essentially simultaneously. \u00a0It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0I don't have to tell you that replacing is a lot more complicated than repealed, especially how do you pay for some of the provisions of Obamacare you want to keep, like the pre-existing conditions? \u00a0Can you really do the really two at the same time, and when will that be? \u00a0How quickly? PENCE: \u00a0The short answer is yes. \u00a0We can do it at the same time. WALLACE: \u00a0Repeal and replace? PENCE: \u00a0The president-elect made it very clear to leaders in the Congress this week that he wanted to do both at the same time. \u00a0And we\u2019re very grateful the House and Senate moved resolutions this week to begin the process of repealing ObamaCare. WALLACE: \u00a0So, realistically, when could you do that, sir? PENCE: \u00a0Lifting the enormous burden -- you are seeing an incredible increase in premiums on Americans. \u00a0ObamaCare has failed. \u00a0We are going to repeal it. But at the same time, we\u2019re going to pass the kind of legislation that will lower the cost of health encourage without growing the size of debt. \u00a0I would anticipate in the first 100 days that we\u2019ll deliver on that promise for the American people. WALLACE: \u00a0Does Mr. Trump still have confidence in FBI director -- did he ever have confidence in FBI Director James Comey? PENCE: \u00a0Well, you will have to ask him about that. \u00a0I know it's been the subject of some commentary this week. But, you know, at the end of the day, I know that whether it's our security at home or abroad, the president-elect is going to put the safety and security of the American people first in every decision. WALLACE: \u00a0You\u2019re not willing to give him a vote of confidence at this point? PENCE: \u00a0Well, you\u2019d have to ask the president-elect. \u00a0I know they\u2019ve had conversations. \u00a0And that will be a good question for him after January 20th, Chris. WALLACE: \u00a0And finally, one minute left -- central message, central theme that President Trump wants to advance in his inaugural address, the message he wants to send to the American people? PENCE: \u00a0Well, I\u2019ll let him speak for himself on Friday. \u00a0I think the American people will see the same Donald Trump they saw every day of this campaign step up to that podium. \u00a0He\u2019s going to speak from his mind, he\u2019s going to speak from his heart, and he\u2019s going to -- he's going to lay out a vision to make America great again. And I have to tell you, Chris, when I stand surrounded by my family and take the oath of office as vice president of the United States, all I will be thinking about is what an honor it is to stand next to a man who I know -- who I know -- can restore and revive this country, and I\u2019ll also just be thinking as the grandson of an Irish immigrant, what a great country this is. WALLACE: \u00a0I should also point out, you\u2019re going to be taking the oath of office on the Reagan bible, which I -- and I gather that\u2019s the first time it will have been used since Ronald Reagan put his hand on the Bible back in the '80s. \u00a0I know how much you revere Ronald Reagan. \u00a0That\u2019s going to be a pretty emotional moment. PENCE: \u00a0It will be, and to have the oath of office administered me by Justice Clarence Thomas, someone who I admire for his philosophy, for his courage on the bench in his 25th year on the Supreme Court. Again, it's just very humbling for me. \u00a0We are approaching it with prayer, but with deep, deep gratitude to the president-elect for his confidence and deep gratitude to the American people who have elected Donald Trump and elected a man who I know is going to make America great again. WALLACE: \u00a0Mr. Vice President-elect, thank you. \u00a0Thank you for joining us during this very busy time. \u00a0And it's always a pleasure to talk with you, sir. PENCE: \u00a0Thanks, Chris. WALLACE: \u00a0Up next, the outgoing chief of the CIA, John Brennan, on those Russian rumors, Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the intel community and the hot spots he\u2019ll face around the world. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: \u00a0A look at the inaugural stage in the west front of the capitol where Donald Trump will take the oath of office on Friday. Mr. Trump begins his presidency in an extraordinary split with the intelligence community, a split that only widened after they presented him with unsubstantiated oppo research the Kremlin allegedly compiled, a file that quickly went public. Joining me here in Washington for an exclusive exit interview is the outgoing CIA director John Brennan. And, Mr. Brennan, welcome back to \"Fox News Sunday\". JOHN BRENNAN, CIA DIRECTOR: \u00a0Good morning, Chris. WALLACE: \u00a0President-elect Trump has made it clear, as we just discussed, that he believes the intelligence community released, put out information about this unverified dossier in order to undercut him. \u00a0Here's what he said at his press conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: \u00a0I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful, that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out be so false and fake out. \u00a0I think it's a disgrace, and I say that and I say that, and that something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0Mr. Brennan, your response. JOHN BRENNAN, CIA DIRECTOR: \u00a0Well, I think as the Director of National Intelligence said in his statement, this information has been out there circulating for many months. \u00a0So, it's not a question of the intelligence community leaking or releasing this information, it was already out there. (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: \u00a0But it hasn\u2019t been reported, though. \u00a0And one of the reasons it hadn\u2019t is because it hadn't been verified. \u00a0And when you briefed the president on it, you collectively briefed the president on it, the president-elect, that made it news. BRENNAN: \u00a0Well, nothing has been verified. \u00a0It is unsubstantiated reporting that is out there, that has been circulating in the private sector and with the media as well by a firm that pulled this information together. But what I do find outrageous is equating the intelligence community with Nazi Germany. \u00a0I do take great umbrage at that, and there is no basis for Mr. Trump to point fingers at the intelligence community for leaking information that was already available publicly. WALLACE: \u00a0But it wasn't available publicly. \u00a0Various news organizations, if I may, various news organization had it, but they weren't reporting it because it hadn't been verified. \u00a0And this brings me to the real question, Director Brennan, why on earth within nations intelligence spy chief's brief President-elect Trump in your first meeting collectively with him on this unverified information? \u00a0First of all, it wasn't intelligence, it was rumors. \u00a0And secondly, my briefing him on it, you made it a news event and, therefore, gave news organizations an excuse to report it. BRENNAN: \u00a0Well, I think news organizations should not assume what happened during that discussion with Mr. Trump. WALLACE: \u00a0Well, it's been verified by the Director of National Intelligence that he was briefed on this information. BRENNAN: \u00a0Chris, bringing to the attention of the president-elect, as well as to the current president that this was circulating out there was a responsibility in the minds of the intelligence directors, of the intelligence community to make sure that there was going to be no evaluation of it, but just making sure that the president-elect was aware that it was circulating. WALLACE: \u00a0But shouldn\u2019t you have done it a bunch of better ways, for instance, had a staff level person, give it to a staff level person, rather than the spy chiefs giving it to the president and the president-elect? BRENNAN: \u00a0Well, I think anybody who has read the reports that are out there, I think there are some very salacious allegations in there, again, unsubstantiated, that were circulating. \u00a0And so, making sure that the president-elect himself was aware of it. \u00a0I think that was the extent of what it was that the intelligence chiefs wanted to do. WALLACE: \u00a0One of the questions, though, is whether the intelligence community is going after -- or somehow is going to try to undercut by selective leaks the new president-elect. Let me ask my question, because former top intelligence officials have been bashing Mr. Trump for months, and I want to put a couple of these on the screen. \u00a0Former acting CIA Director Mike Morell wrote, \"In the intelligence business, we would say Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian federation.\" And then, former CIA Director Michael Hayden said he\u2019d prefer a different term, \"That's the useful fool, some naif, manipulated by Moscow, secretly held in contempt, but his blind support is happily accepted and exploited.\" Can you understand given that and given all these leaks that have been coming out for months, why the president-elect with think the intelligence community had it in for him? BRENNAN: \u00a0Well, these are private citizens now for speaking about the current political environment about individuals. \u00a0So, I\u2019m not going to try to defend or explain what they said. \u00a0But I can tell you that the intelligence community is prepared to support the president-elect and his incoming team, as we have done throughout the course of our history. So, there is no interest in undermining the president-elect and the national security team that\u2019s coming in. \u00a0It's our responsibility to make sure that they understand exactly the dangers that are on the world stage, so that as they can decide on which policy courses they want to pursue, they have both the full benefit of the expertise, the capability, the experience and the intelligence that we have so that they can make the best decisions for this country. WALLACE: \u00a0You said you were offended, and understandably so, by his comparison to Nazi Germany. \u00a0What's the danger when a president-elect and an intelligence community are at such odds and such -- at least on the part apparently of the president-elect -- such distrust? BRENNAN: \u00a0Well, there are many dangers. \u00a0I think the world is watching now what Mr. Trump says, and listening very carefully. \u00a0If he doesn't have confidence in the intelligence community, what signal does that send to our partners and allies, as well as our adversaries? So, I think Mr. Trump has to be very disciplined in terms of what it is that he says publicly, he is going to be in a few days' time, the most powerful person in the world in terms of sitting on top of the United States government and I think he has to recognize that his words do have impact. \u00a0And they can have very positive impact, or they can be undercutting of our national security. WALLACE: \u00a0I want to end this part of the interview with one more question, which is the same question of the device president-elect fence. \u00a0Does the intelligence community have any information -- I\u2019m not talking about rumors, any information -- about contacts between the Trump camp and associates of the Kremlin about discussions during the campaign about hacking the Democrats? BRENNAN: \u00a0The intelligence community collects foreign intelligence on foreign parties, entities or people. \u00a0If in the course of our intelligence collection, we pick up information related to U.S. persons or officials, which we refer to as incidental collection, we share that information with the appropriate authorities. \u00a0In most instances, that\u2019s the FBI. And so, if we did come into contact with that type of information, it would have been shared with the FBI, and we would make sure that our intelligence committees then were aware of it as well. WALLACE: \u00a0So, is there such information? BRENNAN: \u00a0I\u2019d just say, if we came into -- if had that type of information, we would share it with the FBI. WALLACE: \u00a0I mean, I just would say, that's not a denial, sir. BRENNAN: \u00a0Well, I wouldn't confirm or deny something like that on your program, as much as I respect you, Chris. WALLACE: \u00a0Thank you, sir. Let's talk about some hot spots. \u00a0Mr. Trump said in this weekend, as we just talked about it in that Wall Street Journal interview, that he might lift sanctions on Russia if they start helping us. \u00a0And here\u2019s what the president-elect said about relations with the Kremlin in his news conference. \u00a0Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: \u00a0If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? \u00a0That's called an asset, not a liability. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0Do you think that Mr. Trump understands the threat from Russia? BRENNAN: \u00a0I don't think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia's intentions, and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world. \u00a0And that's with the obligation and responsibility of the intelligence community is. I very much hope that our relationship with Russia improves in the coming administration -- absolutely -- because there are very important things we need to do, not just on counterterrorism, but trying to deal with political instability around the globe. \u00a0But here is a fair amount of responsibility on Russia's part to change their behavior, change their actions. \u00a0And what we need to do is make sure that Mr. Trump and vice president-elect. Mr. Pence, understand exactly what it is that we know, what we have intelligence about, so that when they make those decisions, it will be -- they will be informed decisions. WALLACE: \u00a0Are you concerned when you hear Mr. Trump in that interview with \"The Wall Street Journal\" already talking about a situation where he might lift sanctions? BRENNAN: \u00a0I think he has to be mindful that he does not yet have a full appreciation and understanding of what the implications are of going down that road, as well as making sure he understands what he's doing. WALLACE: \u00a0What are the implications of going down that road? BRENNAN: \u00a0Well, when you look at what's happening in Ukraine, and what\u2019s going on in Syria, and what is happening in the cyber realm, I think Mr. Trump has to understand that absolving Russia of the various actions that it's taken in the past number of years is a road that he I think needs to be very, very careful about moving down (ph). WALLACE: \u00a0From your vantage point at Langley, as director of the CIA, what's the most immediate and pressing crisis? \u00a0Foreign policy, national security crisis that Mr. Trump will face? BRENNAN: \u00a0The problem is, the challenges that he is going to face numerous ones immediately. \u00a0You have the problems of terrorism, clearly, the cyber challenge that we just are talking about in terms of elections and other types of cyber capabilities that other countries have. North Korea, increasing development of its nuclear and ballistic missile capability, instability that has wracked the Middle East. \u00a0There are so many issues that the new administration is going to have responsibility for on day one, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to make sure that he and his team are fully briefed on all of these issues. WALLACE: \u00a0As you have heard, and I don't know if you\u2019re able to say this, but you're five days from leaving office. \u00a0What do you think of his plan, of his prescriptions, what he saying about these various trouble spots, crises, challenges around the world? BRENNAN: \u00a0Well, what I think Mr. Trump has to understand is that this is more than being about him and it's about the United States and our national security. \u00a0And he has to make sure that now he's going to have the opportunity to do something for national security, as opposed to talking and tweeting, he's going to have tremendous responsibility to make sure that U.S. national security interests are protected and are advanced. And so, I am very much hoping that he has some very good people that he has pulled together, Jim Mattis, Mike Pompeo, John Kelly, and others. \u00a0I think they are the ones that are going to be able to give him some wise counsel about what he needs to do and not be very spontaneous in his words and his actions. \u00a0Spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests. \u00a0And so, therefore, when he speaks, when he reacts, just to make sure he understands that the implications and impact on the United States could be profound. Again, it's more than just about Mr. Trump, and it's about the United States of America. WALLACE: Finally, you are ending eight years of service as one of President Obama's top national security advisors, both in the White House and then also as CIA director. What \u2013 looking back on these eight years, what is your greatest source of pride and what is your biggest regret? BRENNAN: First, source of pride being part of an administration \u2013 part of an administration that really has tried to advance the interests of peace and stability around the world at a very challenging time, bringing bin Laden to justice, being able to prevent a recurrence of an 9/11 attack here in the homeland. These were things that the administration and the government, as a whole, really did some great work. Regrets, when I look at the situation in Syria, I think my heart and a lot of hearts bleeds over what has happened to that beautiful country. And I \u2013 I regret that we were not able to find a way to arrest the growth of violence and bloodshed there so that we could make sure that Syria is going to have a future for the \u2013 at least the next generation of Syrians. And that's the one area that I'm very \u2013 very regretful about. WALLACE: \u00a0Very briefly, in \u2013 is there a policy that you now believe with hindsight could have worked to stop the \u2013 the carnage and \u2013and interrupted the civil war? BRENNAN: Well, we \u2013 20/20 hindsight is always, you know, quite clear. Looking back now over the last six years, the way some developments happened, the growth of ISIL, ISIL wasn\u2019t \u2013 didn\u2019t exist at the time. I think a lot of countries, including the United States, could have been more aggressive and proactive in terms of what we should have done to \u2013 to prevent the \u2013 the deterioration into so much bloodshed in Syria. WALLACE: \u00a0Director Brennan, thank you. Thank you for your time. And we want to thank you for your years of service to this country, sir. BRENNAN: Thank you, Chris. Thank you very much. WALLACE: \u00a0Up next, we\u2019ll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the Russian intel and this week's confirmation hearings where Mr. Trump's top cabinet picks discuss some surprising disagreements with their new boss. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: \u00a0Coming up, some of Donald Trump's cabinet nominees split with him on Russia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY NOMINEE: With Mr. Putin, we recognize that he is trying to break the North Atlantic Alliance. MIKE POMPEO, CIA DIRECTOR NOMINEE: Russia has reasserted itself aggressively. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0We\u2019ll ask our Sunday panel what those different opinions mean for our foreign policy next on Fox News Sunday. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: A thing like that should have never been written, it should never have been had, and it should certainly never have been released. PELOSI: I always wondered, what did Russia have on Donald Trump? (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0Mr. Trump and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi reacting very differently to that unverified Russian dossier that supposedly has compromising information on the new president. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Gerald Seib, executive Washington editor of The Wall Street Journal, Bob Woodward from The Washington Post, former Democratic Congresswoman Jane Harman, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center, and Washington Examiner contributor Lisa Boothe. Well, Bob, what do you think \u2013 and this is something we discussed with both of our guests \u2013 of the way that the intelligence community handled the so-called Russian dossier? And, overall, how do you think of the way they\u2019ve handle Donald Trump? BOB WOODWARD, THE WASHINGTON POST: I think what\u2019s underreported here is Trump's point of view on it. And you laid it out when those former CIA people said these things about Trump, that he was a recruited, you know, agent of the Russians. WALLACE: \u00a0Useful fool. WOODWARD: Yes, and a useful fool. I mean they started this. And in Trump's mind, he knows the old adage, once a CIA man, always a CIA man. And no one came out and said those people shouldn't be saying things. So then act two is the briefing when this dossier is put out. I \u2013 I've lived in this world for 45 years where you get things and people make allegations. That is a garbage document. It never should have been presented in \u2013 as part of an intelligence briefing. As you suggested, other channels have the White House Counsel give it to Trump's incoming White House counsel. So Trump's right to be upset about that. And I think if you look at the real chronology and the nature of the battle here, those intelligence chiefs who were the best we\u2019ve had, who were terrific and have done great work made a mistake here. And when people make mistakes, they should apologize. WALLACE: \u00a0Well, let me bring in the former top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Congresswoman Harman. Yo know, there is this sense that \u2013 that \u2013 that an awful lot of information that the intelligence community developed about Russia hacking, the garbage dossier, new phrase, that it got public. And \u2013 and can't you understand how Donald Trump would end up feeling like these guys are trying to knife them? JANE HARMAN, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN, D-CALI: Yes, I can understand that. But from the other side, I can understand that very careful and highly trained intelligence professionals think they\u2019re being dissed. John Brennen just said that in hindsight he might have done some things differently. I agree with Bob, there was another way to handle that salacious two page unsubstantiated dossier. But I think the intelligence community seriously has put out its case starting in early October when Jeh Johnson and I think it was Mike Rogers put out the case that there was Russian hacking. And I think it's important for Donald Trump and his good cabinet picks, Dan Coats and \u2013 and Mike Pompeo, to end this war, for two reasons. Number one, we need \u2013 WALLACE: \u00a0The war \u2013 the war, we should say, with the intelligence community. HARMAN: Yes, yes, the war with the intelligence community, for two reasons. Number one, we need these guys. They\u2019re on the front lines now in undisclosed locations. My \u2013 I have visited them all over the world. They\u2019re fabulous. We need them. We need truth to power. But the second reason is, we need our allies to have confidence in the Trump intelligence relationship and not think that if they share information with us, which is crucial for us understanding threats to the United States, it won\u2019t be compromised in some way. WALLACE: \u00a0All right, I want to change dramatically. Gerry, you were one of the two reporters for The Wall Street Journal that conducted that interview over the weekend with President-elect Trump. How dramatically does it seem to you he wants to reshape our relations both with Russia and China? GERALD F. SEIB, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, that's not clear, but what is clear is that the mindset is totally different. This is a -- everything is open for negotiation kind of an approach to the two biggest countries outside the U.S. in the world. The two most important, Russia and China. And he literally said with China, everything is open to negotiation, including the One-China policy. This was the policy by which the U.S. has for years and years recognized Beijing as the one and only true representative government of the people of China, not Taiwan. And on Russia sanctions, he said, I\u2019ll keep the sanctions in place for a while, but we\u2019ll see how the Russians behave. And it's very much a transactional kind of an approach to foreign policy. You\u2019re nice to us, we\u2019ll find ways to be nice to you, and vice versa. And it's going to be different. I mean people will argue the wisdom of it, but the one thing that's clear is that the mindset going in is going to be different. WALLACE: \u00a0The Senate started holding confirmation hearings for Trump\u2019s cabinet picks this week, and one of the things that everyone noticed is the sharp differences between the nominees and Mr. Trump. Let's put some of them up on the screen. There were real differences over the threats posed by Russia, waterboarding, building a wall, and tearing up the Iran nuclear deal with. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. GEN. JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY NOMINEE: It is an imperfect arms control agreement. It's not a friendship treaty. But when America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0Lisa, are we headed for a constructive debate, divergent opinions in the Trump cabinet, or we headed for chaos? LISA BOOTHE, WASHINGTON EXAMINER CONTRIBUTOR: I think we are. I mean, look, Donald Trump came \u2013 WALLACE: \u00a0Well, which one? BOOTHE: Good point. No, I think it\u2019s going to be constructive, so to answer that for clarity sake. But, you know, look, I mean Donald Trump can't win here because he got a lot of criticism during the general election that he wouldn\u2019t take the advice of counsel, that he wouldn\u2019t take the advice of his advisor, but he has surrounded himself with some very smart and capable people, as the CIA director pointed out in his interview with you as far as General Mattis goes. And I think he\u2019ll have a lot more faith in the intelligence community when he does have some people there that he trusts, like someone like Mike Pompeo. In regards to Russia as well, I think the biggest problem here is the distrust, the erosion of trust in \u2013 in just institutions at large when you have the fact that the media reported something that The New York Times said was very difficult to check. And even what could \u2013 can be checked is problematic when the fact that you have sitting members of Congress saying that they're not going to recognize President-elect Trump as the president because he is illegitimate. When you have individuals that are calling for the abolishment of the Electoral College and we\u2019re calling for electors to defect. So I think the biggest problem that we are dealing with right now is the erosion of trust in all of the institutions, whether it's the intelligence community, the media, and the government at large. WALLACE: \u00a0All right. We\u2019re going to take a break here. And it certainly is worth noting, I think that Barack Obama came into office on the same week with a \u2013 an approval rating in the 60s and Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating is in the 40s. So there is \u2013 everybody\u2019s at logger heads here in Washington. All right, we\u2019ll be back in a second. When we come back, an inspector general announces he\u2019ll investigate possible misconduct in the way FBI Director James Comey handled the Clinton e-mail investigation. Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the IG probe? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. ROBBY MOOK, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER: If he has acted improperly and that the American people can no longer have faith in his ability to carry out justice, I think at that point someone should step down. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: \u00a0Hillary Clinton's former campaign manager questioning whether FBI Director James Comey violated FBI regulations in being so public about the Clinton e-mail investigation. This after the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general announced he\u2019ll review Comey's actions. And we\u2019re back now with the panel. Well, Bob, as someone who\u2019s had a lot of dealings with the FBI over the last 40, 45 years, did Comey violate FBI regulations in going so public, and, frankly, should he step down? WOODWARD: Well, I mean, he's got almost no friends right now. Lots of people are calling for his head. I \u2013 I \u2013 I wouldn't anticipate learning too much from this inspector general's investigation. He can't compel people to talk. And they\u2019ll say, oh, yes, that\u2019s confidential or that\u2019s connected to something classified. I \u2013 I think Trump and his people, having done reporting on this, have a lot of respect for Comey on the issue of counterterrorism. The FBI has done a spectacular job in preventing the mass casualty attacks in this country, which were much anticipated after 9/11. So that \u2013 it \u2013 it may hang on that. WALLACE: \u00a0We asked you for questions for the panel and we got a bunch like this one from Lillian Murphy on Twitter. \"I want to know why the IG is not questioning the tarmac meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Lynch.\" Lisa, how do you answer Lillian? BOOTHE: I certainly agree. I think that should be under investigation. I'm glad to find as well that they will be looking at the FBI Andrew McCabe whose wife was a recipient of money from one of the FBI individuals, from Terry McAuliffe, who\u2019s closely connected to the Clinton campaign. BLITZER: Who was the governor of Virginia and gave a lot of money to this \u2013 wife of the \u2013 who \u2013 she was running for office. BOOTHE: Governor of Virginia. Exactly. And I think FBI Director Comey was set up to fail with all of this because any decision he had made from the start would have been met with extreme criticism. If he had recommended an indictment against Hillary Clinton, can you imagine how that would have gone over in this country? And, of course, Loretta Lynch tied his hands by setting out \u2013 or by meeting with President Bill Clinton on the tarmac of that plane. And I think this is a continued scapegoating from the left. And if they want to look for reasons why Hillary Clinton lost, look no further than the fact that they elected someone who was under investigation by the FBI to begin with, or the fact that she spent more money seeing one electoral vote in Omaha, Nebraska, on TV, than Michigan and Wisconsin combined. WALLACE: \u00a0Almost lost in all of the talk about Russia and the FBI this week is the fact that Donald Trump finally announced what his plan is to separate himself from the Trump businesses. But the head of the Office of Government Ethics immediately dismissed it. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WALTER SHAUB, JR., DIRECTOR, U.S. OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS: The plan the president has announced doesn't meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting, and that every president in the past four decades has met. (END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n WALLACE: \u00a0Congresswoman Harman, the Trumps do business around the world and \u2013 which raises the question, every time that he makes a decision, or his administration makes a decision about policy in one of those countries, does it raise the \u2013 the likelihood that people are going to say, well, that\u2019s to advance his business interests? HARMAN: Well, I think he wants his issue to be over. And in this town, appearance and reality are conflated. And I think he could do more \u2013 I\u2019m sure Gerry has some specific ideas \u2013 to stop this story. I just want to say a couple words about Comey. He certainly had my admiration for intervening in \u2013 in former Attorney General Ashcroft\u2019s hospital room to block a Bush administration effort to ratify or renew some surveillance standards against the standard legal procedure. But in this case, the \u2013 his actions this last year to me are inexplicable. Attorneys general are \u2013 or inspector general, are supposed to be independent. This guy maybe should investigate other actions of the Justice Department. But I think he\u2019s within bounds to want to investigate this. And this guy, we just checked it, could be replaced by Donald Trump if he chooses to replace him, Comey, although he serves a 10 year term \u2013 WALLACE: \u00a0Right. So \u2013 so should \u2013 should \u2013 HARMAN: As Bill Clinton replaced the then FBI director, Bill Sessions. WALLACE: \u00a0Very quickly, should Comey step down? HARMAN: I think that\u2019s Comey\u2019s call. Should \u2013 I \u2013 and I \u2013 I don't pretend to make recommendations to Donald Trump. WALLACE: \u00a0OK. All right. Well you shifted the question about the businesses. Gerry, what to think of this? I mean is this going to \u2013 you said \u2013 I think Congresswoman Harman\u2019s exactly right, he wanted to end the controversy. Has he? SEIB: No, absolutely. This is going to be a continuing feature. There\u2019s no way around this. Look, the issue here is that Donald Trump says, I\u2019ve set up a trust. My sons are going to run the business. They\u2019re in charge of it. But the critics say it's not a blind trust. If you sons are running the business, you\u2019re not blind to that by any means. The Trump response to that is, these aren't liquid access. I\u2019m not a guy who has a -- $100 million in stock. I own buildings and a brand. And you can't just sell that. If you sell all those things, it's a fire sale, the value that I\u2019ve built up goes out the window automatically. That is the tension in this question. And it's not going to go away. And I think they realize it\u2019s not going to go away. They\u2019re going to live with it and everybody in town is going to have to question \u2013 deal with questions we haven\u2019t had to deal with before. WALLACE: \u00a0Is there something reasonably that he could have done? I mean as \u2013 as \u2013 as somebody pointed out, he can't un-know the fact that he owns the Trump Tower or that, you know, un-know whether it \u2013 it still is in his property \u2013 his portfolio or not. What could he reasonably have done? SEIB: I think he could have legally separated himself from the Trump Organization more than he has. But he hasn\u2019t done that, and so we\u2019re \u2013 as I said, we\u2019re going to have to deal with that. I think the other option would have been to take his family entirely out of the ownership and leadership of the \u2013 of the company, but that wasn't going to happen. This is the Trump family, and so they weren't going to go there. WALLACE: \u00a0And I kind of wonder when he says he's not going to talk to his sons about the business, I\u2019m thinking, boy, that\u2019s going to be an awkward holiday, huh? So, how \u2013 how about them Redskins? SEIB: Yes. Well, you \u2013 WOODWARD: Every time the Trump Organization make some deal in \u2013 in the Middle East, then people are going to be asking him, have you talked to your sons about this? How does he \u2013 WALLACE: \u00a0Well \u2013 well, in fairness he has said \u2013 he\u2019s said there are not going to be any new deals with foreign countries. But, you know what? WOODWARD: Yes. WALLACE: \u00a0We've got to end. Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. To be continued. Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" The man Donald Trump picked to run his inauguration gives us a surprising preview. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: \u00a0A look at the National Building Museum, site of the salute to our Armed Services Inaugural Ball this Friday. Whether you like him or not, Donald Trump always likes to do things big, but it turns out that's not how he wants his inauguration. Here\u2019s our \"Power Player of the Week.\" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TOM BARRACK, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL COMMITTEE: We need to thank the people who were faithful to us, we need to encourage those who weren\u2019t, but do it simply, do it quickly, do it elegantly, and let's get back to work. Where is the stage? WALLACE (voice-over): Tom Barrack is chairman of the Presidential Inaugural Committee, in charge of organizing 19 events over six days. And he says Donald Trump's marching orders may surprise some people. BARRACK: In its simplicity, the idea is to organize what's already here and available, rather than focusing on a coronation of the man. WALLACE (on camera): Are you saying that Donald Trump wanted to deemphasize the celebration of his victory? BARRACK: He wanted to deemphasize at the celebration of him. WALLACE (voice-over): But even a simple inauguration is a big deal. Barrack has a staff of 360, backed by a security force of 35,000, handling events for as many as 750,000 people. He's running everything, except the swearing in ceremony. BARRACK: It comes together just for that moment, to allow that peaceful transition of power. But it's \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s quite an ordeal. It\u2019s putting on the Olympics in 60 days. TRUMP: We\u2019re going to have a very, very elegant day. The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special. WALLACE (on camera): Donald Trump is a pretty good producer. How involved, how micro-managing has he been about this? BARRACK: He makes me crazy. I had blonde hair and blue eyes when this started. He wants to know the color of the napkins, where\u2019s the linen, how many people are coming, what\u2019s the play list. WALLACE: \u00a0Are you being serious? BARRACK: Yes. And I said, would \u2013 could you go back and just manage the free world and leave me alone? WALLACE (voice-over): One of the president-elect's ideas, do what Andrew Jackson did in the 1820s, open the White House to the public. BARRACK: Of course I had no idea what Andrew Jackson did. I went back and researched it and said, by the way, they absolutely \u2013 WALLACE (on camera): Trashed the place. BARRACK: Trashed the place. So this \u2013 it \u2013 it \u2013 WALLACE: \u00a0It's not a good idea. BARRACK: It\u2019s not a great idea. WALLACE (voice-over): But other ideas are going better. Where Barack Obama had ten inaugural balls in 2009, Mr. Trump said he only wanted three. BARRACK: It\u2019s not appropriate after what we went through. We need a more healing kind of an inauguration. We don't need a celebration of me, the victor. WALLACE: \u00a0Of course there will be protests, but Barrack says as long as they\u2019re not violent, that's fine. BARRACK: Us remembering the dialogue is alive is a good thing, not a bad thing. And \u2013 and that comes from the president himself. So it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s people getting hurt that\u2019s the issue, not \u2013 not protest. WALLACE: \u00a0Barrack and Trump have been close for more than 30 years. Barrack runs a private equity real estate firm with $58 billion in assets, but they've always known where to draw the line. BARRACK: He\u2019s one of my best friends. And \u2013 and the reason I'm not going into the administration is I intend to keep it that way. WALLACE: \u00a0Still, Barrack is ready to defend his buddy. BARRACK: What I tell everybody is, give him a chance. He's not even president yet. WALLACE: \u00a0But first things first, there's an inauguration to put on. WALLACE (on camera): What\u2019s the weather forecast, which is the all-important thing, for Friday, January 20th? BARRACK: Forty-six degrees and sunny. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: \u00a0And the forecast continues to be good weather on Friday. Be sure to tune to this Fox station for coverage of the inauguration anchored by Shepard Smith, or all day on Fox News Channel where I\u2019ll join Bret Baier and Martha McCallum on the National Mall. And that's it for today. Have a great week. And we\u2019ll see you next \"Fox News Sunday.\" Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

      "content": "This is a rush transcript from \"Your World,\" April 25, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Well, it's a go for Joe. The former vice president of the United States, Joe Biden, becoming the 20th democrat to enter the 2020 presidential race. President Trump wasting no time marking the occasion, tweeting out, \"Welcome to race, Sleepy Joe.\" And so, it begins. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. Well, Joe Biden becoming an instant frontrunner at a race, alongside Bernie Sanders, but the frontrunner status can giveth and taketh away. Remember Jeb Bush? He had it against Donald Trump in 2015 before he didn't. And Hilary Clinton certainly led the pack against Barrack Obama and others in 2008, before she was forced to pack it in. Then there's Howard Dean, who emerged as a quick frontrunner against John Kerry in 2004, before a certain scream (ph) might have done him in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KERRY, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: We're going to California and Texas and New York, and we're to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan. And then we're going to Washington D.C. to take back the White House. Yes! (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: And no! You weren't the nominee. (LAUGHTER) Then there's Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson. He looked like a certain shoo-in early on, when Jimmy Carter, unknown, was suddenly replacing him. So being the frontrunner obviously doesn't guarantee you end up in front. More on that in a moment. First, to Peter Doocy in Wilmington, Delaware, who caught up with Joe Biden earlier today. Peter? PETER DOOCY, CORRESPONDENT: Neil, today, Joe Biden enjoys an advantage previously enjoyed by Hillary Clinton and Rudi Giuliani and Jeb Bush. He is the party's frontrunner on the day he announced. But now, he's got to figure out a way forward, without primary help from the ex- president who was very population that he is very good friends with. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DOOCY: If you are the best choice for the democrats in 2020, why didn't President Obama endorse you? JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: I asked President Obama not to endorse. And he doesn't want to - this - we should - whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits. Guys, thanks. Welcome to Delaware. (END VIDEO CLIP) DOOCY: From welcome to Delaware to welcome to the race, that's what President Trump says. Quote \"Welcome to the race, Sleepy Joe. I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign. It will be nasty. You will be dealing with people who truly have some sick and demented ideas. But if you make it, I will see you at the starting gate.\" But progressive groups are not pleased at the thought of a potential democratic nominee, Joe Biden. A group called Justice Democrats, allied with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, tweeted this today, \"The old guard of the Democratic Party filed to stop Trump. And they can't be counted on to lead the fight against his divide and conquer politics today. The party needs new leadership with a bold vision capable of energizing voters in the democratic base who stayed home in 2016.\" That group also posted something where they think the future of the Democratic Party includes things like Medicare for all, the Green New Deal and free college. They do not think Biden's long voting record in the Senate or his record with President Obama reflect that. And we are going to try to ask him about that again if he comes back to the train station named after him. Neil? CAVUTO: I look forward to that. Peter, thank you very, very much. Well, a lot of people said that Joe Biden's opening debut was a little bit dark, rebuking President Trump, for example, over Charlottesville, while announcing his run for president, striking a somewhat ominous tone. Let's see what you think. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: That's when we heard the words of the president of the United States that stunted the world and shocked the conscience of this nation. He said there were, quote, \"Some very fine people on both sides.\" Very fine people on both sides? With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it. And in that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I'd ever seen in my lifetime. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: All right, a bit ominous, a bit dark, maybe justified to some people, maybe for a presidential campaign announcement and coming out the gate a little too dark, when you compare it to past presidents, including John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, even Barrack Obama, who all had a, well, much more upbeat approach. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN F. KENNEDY, 1960 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am today, announcing my candidacy for the presidency of the United States. The presidency is the most powerful office in the free world. Through its leadership can come a more vital life for all of our people. RONALD REAGAN, 1980 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm here because it is the home of Democrats, because I believe today that in this country there are millions of Democrats who are just as unhappy with the way things are, as all the rest of us are. BARACK OBAMA, 2008 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That is why in the shadow of the old state capital, where Lincoln once called on a house divided, to stand together -- where common hopes, and common dreams still live. I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the United States of America. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: Boy, those are the good old days, right? When we had only three or four, maybe tops five people running for president from the same party - - that was then. It's a very crowded field now. Did Joe Biden, with 19 others in the race, muddy the waters? Or distinguish himself with some of those comments? Let's get the read (ph) from former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes, Democratic Strategist Nathan Rubin, and our own Kat Timpf -- Kat, what do you think? KAT TIMPF, CONTRIBUTOR: Well first of all, I could not agree with you more than it was a very dark, and ominous message. He's connected with Obama because he was his vice president, but Obama was saying \"hope and change,\" and this is more fear and dread. Obama had the more -- message of imagine what could happen, and the future we could have if I were president. And this is him saying, there won't be a future if me, or a Democrat is not president. And that's interesting to me because in 2016 the Democrats -- Hillary Clinton, her campaign made things about attacking Trump. And the doom and gloom situation if Trump were to be elected, and they didn't win. And it seems like Joe Biden's announcement at least was doing the same thing. CAVUTO: We should stress that there were some uplifting pieces of video, and photographs in that piece -- but I think it starts coming out the gate, Nathan seeing as the vice president at the time was very critical of, let's say Donald Trump's inaugural address deemed it dark (ph) and a little bit too much so. It just seemed to be a clumsy way to get off, what do you think? NATHAN RUBIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well I think you're absolutely right to point out that historically past presidential candidates have chosen optimism, and like you said they were successful. But I also think Joe Biden has a point when he's trying to paint such a bleak picture of the current state of politics. When you look at what's actually going on in terms of judicial independence, Congressional checks and balances -- you know, the idea that Congress should have oversight over the Executive branch. This current administration doesn't necessarily believe in those items, so to say that -- CAVUTO: Oh no, no -- but it takes two to tango too, right? I mean, I guess Steve what I'm asking you is the message alone. Ronald Reagan of course went after Jimmy Carter, and the stewardship of the economy and the malaise thing. But of course there in his Statue of Liberty announcement when the full (ph) campaign kicked off, he was trying to say I think we can return to higher angels -- better angels and all of that. Should that have been the theme here? Or does it differ depending on the times? STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN: No, I think Biden made a huge mistake. I think it's a classic case, Neil -- he's running four years too late, like Elizabeth Warren. If they'd run in 2016 I think both of them would have had a shot, not only winning the nomination but certainly Biden winning the general election. But people want to hope for the future, for they know things are bad now -- a lot of people they feel that the president isn't up to the office and all that kind of thing. But Biden is being the senior candidate, when the senior candidates there -- should say, \"I've seen a lot, we're going to come out of it -- here's how.\" TIMPF: He's trying to -- CAVUTO: You know, what he's also galvanizing your base -- galvanizing the base, I think to Nathan's point. You know, this hits home with them -- dissatisfaction with Donald Trump, and his stewardship, and that this is going to be a different guy in charge. TIMPF: Right, absolutely and there are people out there -- you see articles all the time about people who are really stressed out, or struggling with anxiety when they think about the fact that Trump is President, and we haven't really seen that kind of thing with any other president before where it's -- people are saying they're going to therapists because of who the president is. But I still think that it should have been a little more inspirational in trying to inspire people, than trying to just make people afraid -- which is clearly what he was going for. If Democrats don't win, the future of the country is fundamentally changed -- that's a pretty extreme thing to say. CAVUTO: You know, it's interesting that we're also learning that Biden today had called Anita Hill, of course it ran (ph) the charges against Clarence Thomas -- to say that he regretted how she had to endure the Clarence Thomas hearings. He's trying to make right from past incidents that are controversial, the MeToo movement and some members of the party. Is that going to work? Is this tone, for example -- let's say this guy, President Trump is a problem, I'm not going to be that problem. I will acknowledge a mistake, or are we getting too convoluted here? RUBIN: Well I think one of the assets that the Obama campaign looked at in 2008 was his long history in Congress and the Senate, but now it's almost looking like a liability when you look at the 1991 Anita Hill hearings, or the 1994 Crime Bill, or even in 1996 when he voted against same-sex marriage. The progressives, the base to the Democratic party are looking at his history and saying, \"wait a second, is that who I want to lead us in to the future?\" And a lot of people are having second thoughts. CAVUTO: Well does that rule out white males -- especially older white males in this party? RUBIN: Well, I don't know if it rules out white males, I think Mayor Pete Buttigieg, to your point Steve, is really striking an optimistic tone in that kind of generational divide where he's saying, I can lead us in to a new, progressive era. That has a lot of clout, I think with a lot of people. CAVUTO: But you know, Steve, you think about it it's not as if President Trump is a cockeyed optimist -- he spends a great deal of time grilling his opponents -- TIMPF: You don't say? CAVUTO: And just saying what he did, even today about Joe Biden that's hardly positive, uplifting, or even presidential. FORBES: He there was attacking an opponent, and I think when the campaign really gets underway you're going to see a very different tone. Do you want to go back to the sluggishness of the past 10 years, or the -- CAVUTO: But do you think the personal swipes have any point in a campaign? FORBES: I think anything can be overdone. And in terms of Biden though, given his age -- he's got to turn that in to an asset, and that's where he's got to make the case. Why am I better than all of these others? Young people, optimistic people -- what do I bring to the table other than I've been around a while, that should make you trust me? CAVUTO: Real quickly guys, it is Biden's nomination to lose, what do you think? TIMPF: I think it's really hard to tell at the beginning. He does have a larger share of the votes in polls, but that share shrinks when there's an undecided option added. A lot of the polls where he has the largest lead there's no undecided option. So it could just be name recognition for a lot of people. CAVUTO: Nathan what do you think? RUBIN: I do not think it's his to lose, I think he needs to prove himself to at least the Democratic party. This is a primary, not a general. CAVUTO: You're right. Steve? FORBES: And because of the proportion of representation (ph) they're now having on delegates, everyone's going to be a factor in that convention. Unless he wins (ph) decisively at the beginning, he's going to get crushed at the Convention. He'll never survive a second (inaudible). CAVUTO: And (Inaudible) says it could be multiple votes, it won't be first ballot, right? FORBES: Yes. CAVUTO: That'll be kind of cool, right? For journalists. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: All right, in the meantime, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is not the only one saying it's time to move on from the Mueller report, now some prominent Democrats are saying the exact same thing, stick around. (COMMERCIAL) CAVUTO: All right. Amazon's a biggie, one of the earnings we look for very close (ph). I think we're a little bit more than a quarter away through the process here. Amazon's sort of like a proxy, if you will, on the economy, how much folks like, well, you and me are buying. And apparently, we're buying quite a bit, at least when it comes to Amazon. How you interpret those numbers is anyone's guess. I know Charles Payne is the immediate go-to guy, here at Fox News and Fox Business, for that. The numbers look good but we have a high bar for these guys. CHARLES PAYNE, CORRESPONDENT: A very high bar. You know, not many companies considered they'd get (ph) almost $60 billion of revenues in three months. CAVUTO: Incredible. PAYNE: It's mind-boggling. And you know, the earnings came in substantially better than Wall Street anticipated. But you know, I got to tell you, Neil, the company has been - it's been a little tougher for them. The last two times they reported, the stock was hammered. So the good news is that for anyone watching and owning Amazon stock, it always typically comes back. Wall Street's trying to figure this thing out. As soon as the numbers came out, the stock popped 50 points, then it was down 11. Now, it's sort of unchanged. CAVUTO: It's sort of seen as a proxy on the consumer as well, right? I mean - and what he or she is (inaudible). If that were the case, because I think there're so many other players, like auto companies and the rest, what is your reading of the economy and anything else that underpins this? PAYNE: You know, I think the consumer's extraordinary strong and confident, but there's an asterisk next to the modern day consumer, and I think it's the aftermath of the great recession, not unlike the great depression. I think consumers are not going to get over their skis (ph). You know, every month, I look at Visa's numbers. I look at Mastercard's numbers. And still, to this day, our debit card spending is greater than our credit card spending. CAVUTO: Is that right? PAYNE: And that's something - that's a phenomenon that occurred in 2009, 2010. CAVUTO: Which indicates more conservative - PAYNE: More conservative. So even though wages are extraordinarily high and going up, even though people know that they're going to have their job tomorrow, because there's 7.5 million out there, you know, and things are - you know, and their debt to monthly bills, their debt to - you know, their income to bill is extraordinary. I mean, there's a lot of room for consumers that they really wanted to go nuts. They could go nuts. But they are spending. They're spending smartly, and that's why, I think, we see some inconsistency in retail sales. But that retail sales report was amazing, so I think we've got a full head of steam (ph) right now. CAVUTO: All right. Now, a lot of the democrats are challenging the president, as you know. We had about 280, as of Joe Biden. But it - their message has been, this is not a great recovery. It's an uneven recovery, and a lot of folks are upset about that. That's a tough sell, when we have the unemployment rate we do, the overall GDP and other numbers that we do. What do you think? PAYNE: It is a real tough sell. It's a - they've gone to a template that they use every election cycle. And somebody's got to tell them, \"Hey, it may not work this time.\" You know, wage is growing at 3 percent or better, year over year, on a given month. It has always been the magic number. Now, for the headline number that we've been at, we've had six months in a row. For blue-collar workers, eight months in a row. In fact, blue-collar workers, not supervisory workers, wages are growing faster than their bosses. What does that mean? That's shared prosperity. So you know, essentially if this - if this keeps like this, you know, they're going have to voters and say, \"Yes, you're kind of getting shared prosperity, but we can get it even more.\" So I don't know. It's going to be tough. CAVUTO: All right, Charles, thank you very, very much. Charles Payne. I want to go to Jon Sale right now, responding to some development on the whole investigation - the Mueller investigation front. The former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, say we have to kind of move on from here. But Jon, if you think about it, that's a lot easier said than done. JON SALE, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, Neil, with all due respect to the former attorney general, that's sort of like setting the sun's going to set and rise. The media is fixed upon the Mueller report. The reason I'm here today is because we're talking about the Mueller report. I read it, from cover-to-cover - both volumes, the appendices, the footnotes. And my takeaway from it is it's a very well written brief. It - they have an agenda. Volume one, we should celebrate that there was no evidence to establish that the president or anyone in his campaign colluded, conspired with the Russians. Volume two - and I'm trying to do this neat, with the confines of a short interview. Volume two, the regulation said that Mueller not may but shall - not shall but must make a judgment, one way or the other. Well, he didn't do that. Instead, they list a number of instances that might be obstruction, but then I think they did what Comey did. They don't give the president a chance to respond, and many of these things could be interpreted two different ways. The - CAVUTO: Well, was that a mistake on his part, by not making a judgment, one way or the other? SALE: I think it was an abdication of his mandate. The make Don McGhan like the sheriff in Dodge who's protecting everybody against the bad guys. He talks about firing the special counsel. And he says you didn't want to know the Saturday Night Massacre. Well, I was there for the real Saturday Night Massacre. That was not obstruction. That was annihilation. I mean we were - I was fired, along with my colleagues, on national television. Here, nobody was fired. And I saw John Dowd interview a couple days ago, and he said he never heard the president talk about firing the special counsel. There's nother instance in the report about dangling pardons. Well, Jay Sekulow, for whom I have a great deal of respect, said he's never seen that happen. So the point is none of it was challenged. So the point is - CAVUTO: So there's enough for Congress to go on there, Jon? Or to investigate? And the president is opposing these subpoenas for his personnel, including McGhan, former personnel, to testify on Capitol Hill. Now, whatever the legality of that is and who wins in that fight, is it a bad idea? Or what do you think? SALE: Neil, what I think is our system to needs to work. We have three co-equal branches of government. The president has a right to challenge the subpoenas. It's going to wind up in court, and the court's going to decide. But remember, Eric Holder was hel in contempt, both civil and criminal. They called something the deliberative process privilege. That's sort of hybrid. And they withheld documents, fast and furious. And what happened when he held in contempt? Nothing. So - but it is up to the courts. And - but if (ph) the courts decide, then our system works. CAVUTO: All right, we'll watch closely. Jon, thank you very much. Jon Sale, the former federal prosecutor. SALE: Thanks, Neil. CAVUTO: All right, you probably saw this, and we're wondering. You have Vladimir Putin. You have Kim Jong-un. You have all sorts of shaking hands and smiling and back and forth. What were they talking about? What did they agree to? And was this meant to stick it to us? After this (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, we're getting a new response from the White House on North Korea supposedly asking the United States for $2 million to pay for Otto Warmbier's medical bills when he was released, remember? He was the American college student imprisoned in North Korea, eventually falling in to a coma, dying soon upon his return to the United States. Blake Burman has more on this, particularly that White House reaction to all of this. Blake? BLAKE BURMAN, CORRESPONDENT: Hi there Neil. You'll remember back in June of 2017 that's when Otto Warmbier was handed back to the United States from North Korea, he was comatose at the time. He returned back home to Cincinnati, Ohio a hospital there in his hometown -- and died just a few days later at 22 years old. Well now Fox is told that before Warmbier was released to the U.S. the North Koreas also gave the U.S. a $2 million medical bill. \"The Washington Post,\" is reporting that Donald Trump approved of a U.S. envoy signing off on that medical bill, however sources also tell Fox that the U.S. has not given a penny of that $2 million to North Korea. Officially over here at the White House, down the street as well as over at the State Department they are not talking about the specifics. But the White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the following in a statement earlier today, \"we do not comment on hostage negotiations,\" which is why they have been so successful during this administration. The Ohio Senator, Rob Portman expressing his outrage at the North Korean demand saying today, \"no, the United States owes them nothing -- they owe the Warmbier family everything.\" As for President Trump we will see him on camera, Neil, for the first time here in just a few minutes time he's about to host an event for Take Your Son and Daughter to Work Day over here at the White House. So it is quite possible that we could either see the President talk about this on his own, or certainly field (ph) the question or two about this. Neil. CAVUTO: Blake, thank you very, very much. Let's get a (inaudible) just as the Russian President Vladimir Putin is meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean Leader in Vladivostok, Russia today. Former USS Cole Commander, Kirk Lippold. Kirk, first of all on this $2 million bill that the North Koreas sent to cover the cost of medical treatment for this young man, leaving aside how outrageous it is, even the sum it is. And to take the administration at its word that such a bill was never paid -- it says a lot about, I think the regime, does it not? KIRK LIPPOLD, FORMER USS COLE COMANDER: Absolutely. It shows just what a tortured regime they are, and the lengths that they'll go to because they have absolutely no moral compass. To even present a bill like that after doing what they did to that young man, is just inexcusable. CAVUTO: Now if we had agreed ahead of time to do this, and to look at this bill and the White House says we never paid it -- is that the same to you as paying for a hostage? LIPPOLD: I don't believe so, I think that in reality we'd want to know what the circumstances were, why he was hospitalized -- we don't know what went on in the back negotiations in order to get him returned. There may have been legitimate medical issues involved that were presented to us. But upon further review, especially when he came back to the States and we saw the nature of the torture that he had undergone, what the North Koreans did to him -- it became very apparent that those medical bills were imposed through North Korean abuse of that young man, and should in no way ever be paid. CAVUTO: You know, Commander over the years and through several presidents you've talked about how reliable the North Koreans are at keeping their word, or even telling the truth period. This is yet, maybe another reminder of that and yet we see the North Korean leader, cozying up Vladimir Putin, he's set to do the same with the Chinese president. So he's kind of playing the field here, should we worry about that? LIPPOLD: I wouldn't worry about that right now. I mean, Vladimir Putin while he may meet with him, is also going to be looking at North Korea with the same jaundiced eye that we do. Let's not forget, if he allows North Korea to continue to build out a nuclear and ballistic missile program, he is looking to have those same weapons potentially pointed at him. Right now, some of his missile -- ICBM missile fields and bombers bases are under threat. If North Korea says that they can reach Guam, well they certainly can reach way in to the Russian interior as well. The North Koreans cannot be trusted, Putin knows that. He knows that China is a threat, he knows that China while there may be mutual interest in trying to poke the United States in the eye, by the same token the only military ally that North Korea has is China. China has aided, and abetted, and allowed that nuclear program to even come in to existence. So it hold Russia a threat almost more than the United States. CAVUTO: Commander, good seeing you again even under these circumstances -- thank you -- thank you more for your service to this country. LIPPOLD: Thank you, Neil. CAVUTO: All right, 1 million illegal immigrants expected to cross in to our country this year -- just this year. Now what? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: This is why they call it a crisis at the border, even an emergency. Homeland Security reporting up to a million border apprehensions expected this year -- people who shouldn't be or who get through here. And yet another care about on the way. It's anyone's guess as to how many are part of that caravan, just that another one is coming. And that million figure might be conservative. The chief of the El Paso, Texas Border Patrol sector, Aaron Hull joins us right now. Aaron, good to have you. How bad is this? AARON HULL, CBP CHIEF OF EL PASO, TEXAS SECTOR: We're telling you all, the numbers keep going up at a faster and faster rate. And we're seeing an unprecedented number of family unit aliens entering which is something new for us. CAVUTO: So how do you handle that? I mean, obviously whole families come in, sometimes kids are a part of that process. How do you deal with that now that the rule is there's no separating them and all of that, what do you do? HULL: Well, it's a huge draw on us logistically in terms of manpower. The family unit aliens require that they be kept together. Children in those groups have additional needs -- medical needs, additional care needs -- that adults don't tend to have. These family unit aliens are from countries other than Mexico, which makes it harder for us to return them because they're not from a contiguous country. All of this pulls our manpower and our resources away from securing the border, placing even fewer of us on the line to protect from the threats coming in. So it's definitely a concern. CAVUTO: And now you have to abide, I guess, by these rules that set ceilings at detention centers. What do you do when those ceilings are exceeded, Chief? HULL: Well, these are human beings. So we have to while we're enforcing the law, we have to make sure that their humanitarian needs are met. So it is a challenge. Border Patrol is only the first step in the process, our role is to catch, process and turn over. When we can't turn over these aliens, because there's no room in detention centers, we have the situation that we're facing now where so many aliens have been released on their own recognizance. And that's not the intent of the law. And it creates further problems along the line. CAVUTO: So what happens to these who board this train, you know, obviously, the Mexican government is trying to crack down as well those from South America, Latin America, Ecuador, and some of these other points. They escape or try to on these trains that make it to the border. That has got to complicate things, too, because that's sort of like a new wrinkle in this battle, right? HULL: Yes. Well, you're seeing more and more extensive smuggling arrangements. You have smugglers advertising their services down in Central America. These people, of course, the bulk of the aliens we're getting are from three countries -- Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador -- they're making arrangements way down there to be moved through Mexico and up here. So in the middle of all this, in the middle of all these humanitarian challenges and border security challenges, smugglers are making a lot of money off these people. CAVUTO: So those who come in in this train, I guess is nicknamed \"The Beast\" or whatever. They hop off that and then they're processed at any one of these border centers, maybe for all I know, yours included, then what? HULL: Well, the people that we're seeing now, these family unit aliens that are making the news so much are basically being bussed north, at least here in El Paso sector, which includes New Mexico and part of West Texas. They're basically being bussed north to the international border and simply walking across. They know that there are forms of relief available to them, through the immigration process, through their asylum claims, through court decisions. They know that when we catch them, they're very likely to be released on their own recognizance, which is why you see their numbers increasing so quickly. CAVUTO: We also hear the administration is pushing that Mexico deal with them in the interim, while all of these cases are being adjudicated, they wait it out in Mexico. Now obviously, many have appealed that and various courts are ruling on the legality of that because up until now, they could wait it out in the United States and escape, right? But if that is not allowed, they can't stay in Mexico, then another line of defense is down for you, right? HULL: Well, we're actually doing that here in El Paso faster sector, it's called the Migrant Protection Protocols. And that's with the partnership with the government of Mexico. We are returning a slowly increasing number of these aliens to await their immigration proceedings in the United States, actually in Mexico and to be brought in at their hearing dates to appear for them. So we're actually doing that now. The numbers are small right now, but they are slowly and steadily increasing. CAVUTO: But if a court were to overrule that, I'd say I don't know we have to go to have them wait in the United States, all bets are off, I would imagine. HULL: Yes, well, it makes it a challenge because the immigration law is already available to these aliens. There are so many options for relief from removal, that every additional court decision of that nature makes it more and more of a challenge for us to secure the border. Because while we're dealing with these family unit aliens, there's no shortage of drug smugglers, criminals, pedophiles, people with contagious health conditions trying to enter and entering the country illegally between the ports of entry. CAVUTO: You have a pretty big job. I wish you well. Chief, thank you very, very much. HULL: Thank you. CAVUTO: All right, well, Joe Biden, as you know, making it official. He is number 20 for 2020, and he is already going after a lot of donors, and he wants more than just 20s from them, after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: Every time I see this picture, I think of the \"Brady Bunch\" thing. There's a story. All these candidates running for President -- no, it's not going to sing, don't worry. That's how many people are running for President right now, for those of you listening, we have 20 boxes here. And if one more person enters the race, that's going to destroy the whole box setup. But the latest entrant is perhaps the most influential one for the time being. Just in terms of money raised or potential to be raised, Joe Biden, he wants within the first week of his announcement to beat everybody's record. He has a good shot at that. But they're already questioning how much he can raise from average folks in small denominations. Because it's not just a bet of how much, but who gives and how many? \"Washington Examiner's\" Kelly Jane Torrance is with us; Republican strategist Nick Adams, Democratic strategist Christy Setzer. Christy, I'd like to begin with you? Is it your belief that -- if you doubt that Joe Biden is not going to have trouble raising money, but it's the mix that might raise questions because the passion isn't there among smaller donors, among those who would ever Barack Obama in the beginning or early on that led to bigger donations. What do you think? CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, we don't know that that's the case yet. He literally just announced this morning. So it could in fact, be the case that he will have a flood of small dollar donations. But let's also think about why we really care about whether these candidates can raise money or not. CAVUTO: Because I led with it, like I led with it. SETZER: We care because -- CAVUTO: That's a good reason. SETZER: It's a really great reason. CAVUTO: There we go. SETZER: It's an amazing reason. But beyond that, we care because it shows that they have an ability to compete in this race, right? And we already know that Joe Biden is going to have the ability to compete. He is already very well known. He has already had the ability to get his message out there. He's not going to have to have some of these stumbling blocks that somebody who is an unknown candidate without money would have to face. So in his particular instance, I'm not sure that whether or not he raises the most amount of money will be the most important thing about his canvassing. CAVUTO: You know, one of the things, Kelly Jane Torrance, we learned from Donald Trump, billionaire though he is, I mean, many competing for the Republican nomination in 2016. We're certainly raising a lot more money from so-called party regulars and pros, and it didn't do them the wicked good, right? I mean, Jeb Bush raised over $100 million and didn't materialize into much. So what do you think? KELLY JANE TORRANCE, JOURNALIST, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Exactly. You know, I keep hearing from Democrats for years now, that money buys politics, that's the most important factor. And I think we've seen especially in 2016 that that's just not the case. But even that -- CAVUTO: But it is a sign of passion, right? TORRANCE: It is, yes. CAVUTO: I mean, it is a sign and maybe Nick you can help me with is that if you're raising money among small donors, those will give 10 or 15 bucks at a time. That was an early sign for Barack Obama that he was onto something or hitting a chord. And before we knew it, you know, he wins Iowa, you know, he's on his way to the nomination. What do you think? NICK ADAMS, GOP FUNDRAISER: It is a sign of enthusiasm. TORRANCE: It's interesting though because -- CAVUTO: Go ahead, Nick. I will get back to you on that, Kelly. Go ahead. ADAMS: Neil, it's a sign of enthusiasm. It's a sign of passion. It's a sign that you're making a connection with the everyday person, and of course, it's a sign that bodes well for an actual election campaign. If you're getting the support of everyday people in small quantities during a primary, then there's a very good chance that that's going to correlate to the general. In Joe Biden's particular case, I don't think that we're going to see him raising a lot of money from everyday people and I don't think he's got any kind of chance whatsoever when it comes to the general election. CAVUTO: Kelly Jane, obviously, the White House has been trying to dismiss him out the gate, maybe they're worried about him. But do you think the fact that he does have the name recognition, he does have a great broad base appeal here, now how that translates in a nomination though, I have no idea. But that's something the White House is worried about. TORRANCE: I do think they're worried and I think Biden is their top worry. You know, talking about money, yes, a lot of small donors, it does indicate appeal. But you know, it's interesting, Bernie Sanders actually sent out an e-mail a few days ago to his supporters, saying that they weren't giving him enough basically. He actually complained that the average donation to him was lower than that of most of the other candidates. So you've got some mixed messages there. You know, we heard today that Andrew Cuomo, New York Governor plans to open his fundraising apparatus to Joe Biden, and you know, about 80 percent of Andrew Cuomo supporters gave over $10,000.00. So you know, it's mixed, you know, they want money to do the ads. They want money to show that they have a real campaign. But you're right, does it speak to passion? And I think Bernie Sanders certainly has that passion. He's got a lot of small donors, but it didn't help him enough in 2016. CAVUTO: You know, you might be right, but Christy, I know that there are going to be a variety of fundraisers for the former Vice President including at the home of David Cohen, of course, the Senior VP of Comcast, the big cable entertainment concern, although, there are other well-heeled backers who are going to be there? I don't think Joe Biden needs to worry about financial support. But how do you see this sorting out given the proportional number of delegates in the Democratic primary system? Could you see a situation where you get to the convention, and no one has the delegates necessary? And we might have to go through multiple ballots to get there? SETZER: I suppose so. But at this point, that's kind of what we'd call concern trolling. I mean, the convention is so far away. And while we obviously have an incredibly large field right now, you know that there's going to be a number of people who are going to have to drop out maybe even before Iowa, but the Iowa caucuses are, what? Eight months away. Then we have a very compressed primary schedule. And so I think you're going to see this winnow out pretty quickly after that. 2019, by contrast, is going to be a really nice, strong, healthy debate among a lot of people who are bringing different issues to the table. You have somebody like Jay Inslee, who just wants to talk about climate change. You have others who brought, you know, different other issues that they're bringing to the fore. So I think we can right now see it as sort of an embarrassment of riches and know that it is going to winnow out, and it will winnow pretty quickly. CAVUTO: Nick Adams, an embarrassment of riches. That was kind of like the situation Republicans enjoyed with Donald Trump when they were 16 or 17 running. This is 20. ADAMS: Yes, there are lots of options, Neil, but I don't know that any are any good. Look, when it comes to Vice President Joe Biden, what do we say? I think he's past it. I think he's had his time. I think he's antiquated. I think he's a relic. I think he belongs in a museum. I think he's super annulated to use -- CAVUTO: Hey, hey, you're going to be old someday yourself, young man. SETZER: Some day you will. ADAMS: Well, it's not that he's old. It's that he has all the wrong experience. He was the Vice President under President Obama. And I don't think that any American in their right mind wants to return to those days. CAVUTO: You know, Christy, on that point, Barack Obama -- and this -- I don't know why this is deemed a news alert to a lot of folks. He is not endorsing anyone, including the Vice President. You know, it's still early on in the race, and he has to let everyone fight through. But can he count on some of the Barack Obama apparatus that elected him President? Some key figures have done a little work on the Biden campaign; and others, you know, have gone on to the O'Rourke and other campaigns. So they are spread around a little bit. What do you think of that? SETZER: Yes, that's a great question. I mean, because obviously, the people who go to work on campaigns, and I was one of them for a dozen years or so tend to be really young, right? And obviously, not just younger than President Obama, but a lot younger than Joe Biden. Right now, the energy in the party is for a lot of these candidates who are a generation younger than Joe Biden. And so of course, they've been no surprise attracted to some of those candidates. So sure, he's going to get some of those people who very much see themselves as you know, Obama-Biden, people, and a lot of them have already gone to other places. You know, I don't know that that's that big of a deal. I think we've had so much speculation about Biden up to this point, like now the race starts and I will say that I am someone that was not really sure how this is going to end. And I guess I'm still not sure how it's going to go for him. But I do believe that his announcement video was pitch perfect and gave -- CAVUTO: Really? SETZER: Absolutely, I believe that. CAVUTO: It's kind of a Debbie Downer though, wasn't it? I mean, it's -- SETZER: No, I thought that it showed a ton of gravitas. CAVUTO: Really? SETZER: I mean, which we know he has. CAVUTO: Okay. SETZER: But yes, I really thought if that's the note that he's starting with ... CAVUTO: As far as announcing -- ADAMS: It is also untruthful. CAVUTO: It's just a little dark, a little dark. That's all. SETZER: Well, as compared to Donald Trump? I mean, I don't know. But yes, so anyway, I think that if that is the note that he stays on, it will go very well for him. ADAMS: It was definitely dark. CAVUTO: Nick, you found it dark. ADAMS: Yes, look, I think it was dark. I think it was definitely dark and it was untruthful, too, part of it. He said that the President the called neo Nazis fine people -- SETZER: He didn't say that. ADAMS: And he definitely didn't do that. SETZER: He definitely didn't do that, Nick. ADAMS: Let's go back and have a look at the -- CAVUTO: He didn't say it quite like that. He did say that the President didn't do a great job with Charlottesville, but we'll see. The race is on as you all see. I want to thank you all. We go from that to talking about measles and record numbers of issues that are not being addressed because a lot of people don't get vaccinations and now a legal battle is on our hands. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, this measles outbreak is now the worst since the government told us that the disease was supposedly eradicated back at the turn of the last century. Our David Lee Miller has much more on these stunning numbers. I cannot believe this, David Lee. DAVID LEE MILLER, CORRESPONDENT: Indeed, Neil. You know authorities say that there are now 695 reported cases of measles in 22 states and no one knows how many people have the measles and haven't sought help. In the near term, the CDC says it expects the number of people infected with the virus to continue to rise. The overwhelming majority of cases are in Orthodox Jewish communities in the New York City area. There's also been a large outbreak of the disease in Washington State. According to the CDC, misleading information about the vaccine is preventing people from immunizing their families. Although for many children, a case of the measles can be a mild illness, authorities warn, it can also be deadly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NANCY MESSONNIER, NCIRD DIRECTOR: Two out of a thousand kids with measles actually die, and if I can't tell you whether your child is going to have a mild or severe illness, why would you take the risk? You should go ahead and vaccinate them and protect them. (END VIDEO CLIP) MILLER: In California, hundreds of anti-vaccine demonstrators rallied to voice opposition to a bill requiring tougher restrictions on vaccine exemptions. The State Senate Health Committee after a contentious hearing approved a proposal that will let public health officials decide instead of a family doctor if a child can go without a vaccination before beginning school. According to the World Health Organization, before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, 2.6 million people a year died from measles worldwide. There are still more than a hundred thousand measles deaths globally each year. And those cases, Neil, could be making the situation worse here in the U.S. The CDC stresses spread of the disease here can be stopped with a simple and safe vaccination -- Neil. CAVUTO: Wow, David Lee. Thank you very much, David Lee Miller. We're going to take a quick break here. Just to let you know that Ford earnings are out as well. This is the earnings season. Better than expected, in fact, a lot better than expected. It made 44 cents a share versus the 27 expected. I mention that because that's an economic barometer. If people were hurting, they wouldn't be buying cars. Apparently, they were buying a lot of Ford cars. We'll have more after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: Busy earnings time, busy market times. I talked about Lyft, the online rideshare, and now Uber. The other shoe to drop in that field announcing an IPO -- Initial Public Offering -- priced anywhere between $44.00 and $50.00 a share. The formal debut will probably be early next month. I don't know what the range was they considering. I think that's a little higher than they're initially considering. Lyft had a sort of a knock after its debut. We'll see what happens with Uber. Here's \"The Five.\" Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

In a televised speech Friday night, Gen. Khalif Ahmed Ereg, Somalia's national security minister, said the warning was based on credible intelligence that militants are planning attacks on key targets including medical and educational institutions following the death of Ahmed Abdi Godane. Ereg says the government is vigilant and prepared its armed forces to prevent such desperate attempts. Godane had publicly claimed al-Shabab was responsible for the deadly Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya almost a year ago that left 67 people dead. President Barrack Obama confirmed Friday that Godane was killed by the U.S. airstrike.",

      "content": "Donald Trump has announced his team of economic advisers, a group that includes many of the people already helping his campaign. It includes John Paulson, a hedge fund billionaire who made his fortune betting against subprime mortgages as the American economy headed toward collapse in 2007; Tom Barrack, a real estate investor and close friend of Trump who has been raising money for a super PAC supporting the billionaire candidate, and Steven Mnuchin, a New York investor who is Trump's national finance chairman. The team is being led by Trump's national policy director, Stephen Miller, along with Dan Kowalski, a former staffer on the Senate Budget Committee. But the list is as notable for who is not on it as who is: It is comprised solely of men, with no women -- just like the campaign's public list of foreign policy advisers. It also excludes many prominent Republican economists who have advised past candidates. Trump's announcement Friday came as the government reported that U.S. employers added a healthy 255,000 jobs last month. That could bolster Democrat Hillary Clinton's claim that the state of the U.S. economy under President Barack Obama is not nearly as dire as described by Trump. On Monday, Trump will deliver an economic speech in Detroit focusing on \"empowering Americans by freeing up the necessary tools for everyone to gain economically,\" the campaign said. Trump has faced criticism from Clinton over his reluctance to provide detailed policy proposals. He released a tax plan in September that proposed cutting rates across the board and reducing the amount paid by the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Analysts, however, said it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and dramatically boost America's debt, despite Trump's assurances to the contrary.",

The song, \u201cAlmost Like Praying,\u201d includes vocals by Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Camilla Cabello, Gloria Estefan and more.  The song lists all 78 Puerto Rican towns.

Later this month, another group of musicians will come together at Texas A&M University to hold a hurricane relief concert. The lineup has yet to be released, but there are some famous faces locked in to attend. Each of the five living former U.S. presidents will attend the concert that will benefit recoveries in Texas, Florida and the Caribbean. A statement from the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library Foundation stated that Bush would be joined by former presidents Barrack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.

A Parliament committee agreed last month to support amending Canada's sanctions rules to include rights violators, acting in honor of the Russian whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after accusing officials of a $230 million tax fraud. Russia's presidential council on human rights said the 37-year-old Magnitsky, who was a lawyer for Browder's Hermitage Capital firm, was beaten and denied medical treatment while in jail. The government's decision is bound to further strain relations with Russia, which has reacted strongly to the imposition of Magnitsky-style legislation elsewhere. After U.S. President Barrack Obama signed such legislation into law in 2012, Russia responded by banning American citizens from adopting Russian children. The U.S. Magnitsky Act sanctioned five Russian officials involved in alleged human rights violations in the Magnitsky case.

      "content": "President Trump is known for using Twitter to communicate his thoughts \u2014 but he\u2019s also known for the spelling and grammar errors throughout his tweets. Here\u2019s a look at some of Trump\u2019s more interesting online spelling and grammar errors. \u201cEnormously consensual presidency\u201d In an effort to share some praise for his administration from a New York Post columnist, Trump inadvertently referred to his administration as an \u201cenormously consensual presidency.\u201d \u201cHis is turning out to be an enormously consensual presidency. So much so that there has never been a day that I wished Hillary Clinton were President,\u201d Trump tweeted on Jan. 7, 2017, referencing a New York Post column by Michael Goodwin. The problem: Goodwin didn\u2019t call Trump\u2019s presidency \u201cconsensual.\u201d Instead, he called it \u201cconsequential.\u201d Trump eventually deleted the tweets and republished a corrected version, but not before Twitter took notice. As Politico reported, the error seemed particularly egregious as the president has been accused of sexual misconduct. In the original tweets, Trump left out a clause that was critical of the White House from the column. The amended tweets included the phrase, \u201cdespite my own frustration over his missteps.\u201d Additionally, Trump also added Goodwin\u2019s email address to the original tweet. The corrected tweets included a link to the column, instead. \u201cCovfefe\u201d Trump turned one of his more famous spelling mistakes\u00a0into a contest of sorts when he asked his 46 million followers to figure out what exactly is a \u201ccovfefe.\u201d \u201cDespite the constant negative press covfefe,\u201d Trump tweeted just after midnight on May 31, 2017, in a post that was eventually deleted. Later that morning, Trump\u00a0asked\u00a0which of his followers \u201ccan figure out the true meaning of \u2018covfefe.\u2019\u201d \u201cLoose\u201d Before Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was dubbed \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d during the 2016 presidential election by Trump, the Manhattan businessman\u00a0predicted his GOP opponent would \u201cloose\u201d to then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \u201cTed Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!\u201d Trump tweeted\u00a0in January 2016. The tweet was not deleted. \u201cPayed\u201d \u201cAll of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, the bandits that tell your pols what to do,\u201d Trump said in a still-live\u00a0March 2016 tweet. In nautical terms, the past tense of pay is \u201cpayed.\u201d But when it comes to finance, it\u2019s \u201cpaid.\u201d \u201cBarrack\u201d In multiple instances, Trump added an additional letter to his presidential predecessor\u2019s name. \u201cThe dying [National Review] has totally given up the fight against Barrack Obama. They have been losing for years. I will beat Hillary!\u201d Trump tweeted\u00a0in January 2016. \u201cJust another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama,\u201d Trump said in March 2016 in a\u00a0tweet about Mitt Romney. \u201cUnpresidented\u201d It took Trump and his team more than an hour to fix the atrocious spelling of the word \u201cunprecedented\u201d in a December 2016 tweet. \u201cChina steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented act,\u201d Trump tweeted. The\u00a0corrected tweet\u00a0was retweeted more than 18,000 times. The Guardian\u00a0dubbed\u00a0\"unpresidented\" to be its word of the year. \u201cHonered\u201d The day after he was inaugurated, Trump misspelled\u00a0the word \u201chonored.\u201d \u201cI am honered to serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the United States,\u201d he said. As the British newspaper Metro reported, that wasn\u2019t the first time Trump struggled with a variation of the word \u201chonor\u201d in tweets. Following a February 2016 debate, Trump tweeted, \u201cWow, every poll said I won the debate last night.

      "content": "NEW YORK \u2013 President-elect Donald Trump will take the traditional ride from the White House to the Capitol with his predecessor before his inauguration next week, but he will break from some of the day's other customs, trading traditional celebrity appearances for the \"soft sensuality\" of the historic event. Tom Barrack, a longtime Trump friend serving as his top inauguration planner, told reporters Tuesday at Trump Tower that the president-elect instructed him to make the swearing-in \"about the people, not about him.\" \"So what we've done, instead of trying to surround him with what people consider A-listers, is we are going to surround him with the soft sensuality of the place,\" Barrack said. \"It's a much more poetic cadence than having a circus-like celebration that's a coronation. It will be beautiful. The cadence of it is going to be, 'Let me get back to work.'\" Inauguration organizers have been rebuffed by several celebrities, among them British singers Charlotte Church, who wrote Tuesday on Twitter that while Trump's \"staff have asked me to sing at your inauguration, a simple internet search would show I think you're a tyrant. Bye.\" TRUMP CELEB CREW AWAITS HIS TURN IN THE SPOTLIGHT, AND THEIR OWN Rebecca Ferguson, a runner-up on \"The X Factor\" in the U.K., wrote on her website Tuesday that she, too, had declined to take part. She wrote that she would have only performed at the Jan. 20 inauguration if she were allowed to sing Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit,\" a song that protested racism and the lynching of African Americans. The entertainers who have agreed to take part in the festivities are Jackie Evancho, of \"America's Got Talent,\" the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Radio City Rockettes. No details have been announced for the official welcome concert on the eve of the inauguration, beyond a promise to feature \"a diverse group of performers.\" Barrack, a private equity real estate investor, said Trump has opted to make the inauguration a celebration of everyday Americans and the military. He added that inauguration planners are \"fortunate in that we have the greatest celebrity in the world, which is the president-elect.\" MARCHING BAND DRUMS FOR DOLLARS TO ATTEND TRUMP'S INAUGURAL PARADE Since his election, including on his raucous \"thank you\" tour to states that helped deliver him the White House, Trump has made little effort to reach out to those who didn't vote for him. But Barrack said the president-elect wanted his inauguration to be a unifying event. \"'The campaign is over, I am now president for all the people,'\" Barrack said Trump told him. \"'I want you to build a bridge and tie them back in. I was to heal the wounds and I want to get back to work on Saturday morning.'\" Barrack also confirmed that Trump and his wife Melania would visit with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at the White House on Friday morning before riding together to the ceremony at the Capitol.",

The mugs were destroyed Monday after a customer pointed out the president's name had been misspelled \"Barrack.\" A government official, who declined to be named citing departmental policy, said the error had been made by an official who ordered the mugs from a manufacturer. Alan Thompson, head of the Department of Parliamentary Services, told The Canberra Times newspaper the error was embarrassing. \"He's a very important head of state. We take a lot of pride welcoming people like President Obama and we won't be having them on sale,\" Thompson was quoted as saying Tuesday. Obama has twice canceled scheduled trips to Australia this year. He first bowed out so he could stay in Washington to shepherd his health reforms through Congress. He canceled a trip scheduled this month so he could concentrate on the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.",

Appearing on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\u201d Collins told hosts Bill Hemmer and Julie Banderas the Mueller Report was what anti-Trump Democrats had \u201cbanked on\u201d for almost two years. \u201cThey said, 'Leave it alone; don\u2019t touch it.\u2019 That\u2019s all we were hearing because they believed that the Mueller report was actually going to give them the ammunition to give this president that they\u2019ve hated for so long,\u201d he bemoaned. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen!\u201d In an interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos broadcast on Sunday, the president called Mueller\u2019s investigation a \u201cset up.\u201d TRUMP SAYS HE WOULD 'WANT TO HEAR' DIRT ON 2020 RIVALS FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, SUGGESTS HE WOULDN'T CONTACT FBI \u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no crime. There was no collusion. That big thing\u2019s collusion. Now, there\u2019s no collusion. That means they set\u2014it was a setup.\u201d Collins believes Attorney General William Barr was right to hire Connecticut-based U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate the origins of the probe. \u201cI think, when you go back and you look\u2026the American people ought to say, \u2018Why\u2019d this happen?\u2019 How did we get here?\u2019 And, I think [the president] was pointing that out,\u201d Collins said. That \u201ccorrupt cabal\u201d with famed FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, Collins said, stemmed from the investigation into then-candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server and \u201cflowed right into the Russia investigation that was based on some very false pretenses.\u201d TRUMP ASKS MULVANEY TO LEAVE OVAL OFFICE FOR COUGHING DURING ABC INTERVIEW During her tenure as United States Secretary of State, Clinton used the server for official communications, rather than using the official State Department email accounts maintained on secure federal servers. Further examination revealed that there were over 100 emails sent containing classified information. An additional 2,093 emails not marked classified were retroactively classified by the State Department. This was a major discussion during the 2016 presidential election, but then FBI Director James Comey announced no charges would be filed. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot more to be asked there about how far did this go up,\u201d Collins urged. \u201cThis was not low-level investigators. This was a high-level of employees at the DOJ and FBI who were a part of this and they didn\u2019t farm any of it out.\u201d Stephanopoulos also asked the president if he believed former President Barrack Obama was \u201cworking against\u201d him to which President Trump replied, \u201cI would say that he certainly must have known about it because it went very high up in the chain. But you're gonna find that out. I'm not gonna make that statement quite yet. But I would say that President Obama had to know about it.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Collins believes Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s upcoming report will help to shed some light on what had transpired and that Democrats are worried: \u201cThey do know that the Horowitz report is going to come out and the FISA abuse part of this where you\u2019re actually taking on American citizens and using a secret court to do this when you have unverified documents -- stuff that were brought before this court -- is a problem.\u201d \u201cNow you see Comey and you see Baker, you see McCabe and you see these folks going out trying to rehabilitate themselves. I\u2019ve said this before: Jim Comey\u2019s not out on the TV circuit right now because he thinks he\u2019s right. I think he\u2019s trying to rehabilitate himself because he knows, when we look at what actually happened, there\u2019s going to be some problems here,\u201d Collins said.",

      "content": "This weekend, Dr. Julie Gerberding resigned as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and will be replaced by an interim deputy director. I hope that President-elect Barrack Obama's replacement will be made on the basis of merit rather than politics. The CDC is one of the major branches of the Department of Health and Human Services. One of its major roles is to make sure America is prepared for new health threats. One of its major focuses has been on disease prevention and therefore it is my opinion that its new director should have strong roots in clinical medicine as well as research. The CDC has turned into a very large bureaucracy with offices in 54 countries around the world, and even though it is one of the best run government agencies in the country, it must reengineer itself to meet the health challenges of the new Century. As we look at where America is in terms of disease prevention, these are the areas where we need to do a better job_ heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy care and bioterrorism. I've never truly understood how scientific government positions are chosen. I wish that we would have more transparency so that we can understand on what merit some of our top scientists are chosen. I have recently read some of the top names that are circulating as a possible director of the CDC, which include the health directors of many of our cities, including Dr. Thomas Friedman, the health commissioner of New York City. However, I would suggest that if we really want change to occur in the CDC, the new director should have a strong clinical research background. So here's my list of some candidates that I hope will be considered: Dr. Charles Lockwood - Chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Yale University. Dr. David R. Bickers - Chairman of Dermatology at Columbia University. Dr. William C. Wood - Chief of Surgery at Emory Dr. Michael Lincoff - Director of Clinical Research at Cleveland Clinic These are a few great scientists I hope the Obama transition team will look at. And, as I said, politics should not play a role in choosing our top scientists - and I hope it doesn't.",

They want to hear something from him that says to them, you know what, it's going to be OK. But instead we are hearing from the combative Donald Trump. TOM BARRACK, COLONY CAPITAL CEO: And I understand that the feeling is that the president-elect himself is fueling this because he continues to be adversarial on issues he's concerned with. But at the same time. (CROSSTALK) COSTELLO: He is entrenching Americans in their camp. (END VIDEO CLIP) Oh my God! She is the only Costello less serious than Lou. Now I get it. Trump sounds mean and Obama is so soothing he is like a cup of chamomile tea that drones people. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We have traveled the world together. We did a few singles, a few doubles together. I have offered advice that I thought was pretty sound, like don't do stupid stuff. And even when you complained about my long answers, I just want you to know that the only reason they were long was because you asked six-part questions. (END VIDEO CLIP) Ha-ha-ha. Now, to that Dr. Jekyll, Trump is Mr. Hyde. He is loud, impulsive, a pissed off Creamsicle. The media says he is dividing America. Yet, few minded when Hillary called half of America irredeemable. Republicans are always demonized. Now, for once, we demonize back. Here is \"Joyless\" Behar from the knitting circle in hell. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"THE VIEW\"/ABC) JOY BEHAR, CO- HOST: Let's talk about what's going on right now because the inauguration of a certain person is happening on January 20th. (LAUGHTER) SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST: He who shall not be named. BEHAR: Right. It's happening January 20th. And there are millions of people who did not vote for him and who feel frightened. I run into people all the time. \"Joy, keep talking, we are scared, we don't know what to do.\" (END VIDEO CLIP) No one says \"keep talking\" to Joy. Oh, the good old days when only liberals scared us -- the Weather Underground, the Black Panthers, FALN. The FALN killed many, they maimed cops, they terrorized cities. And now, President Obama just releases one. And you thought Bill Ayers was just a fluke. The lesson: When the left kills, it's romantic. A Republican is rude? Now that's evil. So as young leftists threaten campus security to a point where right-wing events are canceled and anti-Trump leftists plan to attack inaugural events, the media keep saying, \"People, beware of Trump.\" Perhaps projecting panic masks their bias. What the media does to Trump is what they did the cops -- say the police are really harmful, then later ask why people are so scared of the police. So they treat a Trump White House like a zombie apocalypse, hoping the mentality spreads. But one thing is clear: Judging from the last presser, the press adores President Obama. They still do. Yet they fear Trump. Change is good.",

He might have two faces, but we know all too well who the true Mitt Romney is.\" Best Pix of the Week In the lead-up to the Florida GOP primary, the two groups also released an ad in Orlando and Tampa attacking Romney.\u00a0Romney decisively won the primary Tuesday night. Romney supported strict immigration laws approved in Arizona and Alabama, yet in Florida played up his Mexican-American roots. \u201cMitt Romney is willing to do and say anything in whatever language and in whatever forum to get elected,\" Eliseo Medina, SEIU Secretary Treasurer, said during a conference call Wednesday.

But the soft drink company is not the only business that appears to try piggyback on the Obama success. Ice-cream maker Ben & Jerry's is renaming its butter pecan ice cream \"Yes Pecan!\u201d \u2014 which sounds a lot like Mr. Obama's campaign slogan \"Yes We Can.\" The company's founders endorsed the senator in February. The Ben & Jerry's Web site describes the renamed flavor as \"amber waves of buttery ice cream with roasted non-partisan pecans.\" Call Off the Dogs And finally, an annual sled dog race in Frazee, Minnesota has been canceled. It\u2019s been called off twice before because of a lack of snow. But this time, the race has been abandoned because there is too much snow. There are reports of record snowfall from across the country this winter \u2014 a blow to global warming theorists. And Frazee is no different. Organizers say there is so much snow that they cannot prepare the tracks. The cancellation is a blow to the town since the event attracted up to 3,000 visitors last year. \u2014 FOX News Channel's Zachary Kenworthy contributed to this report.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Barrack Obama on Thursday nominated a defense official as U.S. special envoy to Myanmar with the tough job of negotiating with its military-dominated government and pushing for reform. Derek Mitchell will have the rank of a State Department ambassador if confirmed by the Senate in the position, which was mandated in 2008 legislation but has yet to be filled. Mitchell, a China scholar with wide experience in Asia, is principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs. Early in his career, he worked on the foreign policy staff of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and then for a Taiwanese newspaper, China Post. He has also held positions at Washington-based think tanks, including the Center for Strategic and International Studies. As special representative and policy coordinator for Burma, as Myanmar is also known, Mitchell would be charged with speaking with the government and opposition leaders, coordinating U.S. policy and working with the international community. In the past 18 months, the Obama administration has shifted the longstanding U.S. policy of isolating Myanmar's generals, attempting to engage them while retaining sanctions imposed because of the military's poor record on human rights and democracy. The policy has made little headway. Elections staged in November ushered in an overwhelmingly pro-military government, although opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was then released from years of house arrest. Her party, whose 1990 election victory was never honored, has been outlawed because it refused to contest the latest polls which it said were unfair. Myanmar's Southeast Asian neighbors have called for Western nations to lift sanctions. On Tuesday, the European Union eased its restrictions a little, lifting a visa ban on some civilian members of the government. The U.S. says it is premature to lift sanctions. It is urging Myanmar to release its more than 2,000 political prisoners and open up its politics. Washington is also concerned about Myanmar's alleged nuclear ambitions and trade in weapons with North Korea.",

      "content": "This is a RUSH transcript from \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" March 6, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET! BOLLING: In the unresolved problem segment tonight, is President Obama conceding too much to Iran in the nuclear negotiations? Several months ago, the supreme leader of Iran tweeted that our ally Israel should be annihilated. Now in the brink of a deal with the west, Iran is making a pathetic attempt to explain itself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPORTER: We were able to find the tweet that he referred to from the supreme leader, quote, this barrack, wolf like regime of Israel which has no crime, has no cure but to be annihilated. Mr. Prime Minister, can you understand why Jews and others would not like that kind of language? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I won't because this is a regime. We're talking about Netanyahu who has butchered innocent children in Gaza. We're not talking about the annihilation of Jews, we never have we never will. (END OF VIDEO CLIP) BOLLING: Is this a regime America should be negotiating with? Joining me now, with analysis from Washington, Tom Collina, director Ploughshares Fund, a global security foundation and from Palm Springs California, my friend Rick Grenell, a former spokesman for several of America's US Ambassadors and a Fox News contributor. Tom let me start with you that were the Iranian foreign minister negotiating with John Kerry as we speak; this is a man who said he read the tweet saying Israel should be annihilated. He didn't have a good response, did he? TOM COLLINA, PLOUGHSHARES FUND DIRECTOR OF POLICY: We can all agree we all want to stop Iran from getting a nuclear bomb. That's a shared goal. The question is, how best to get there. The negotiations that the United States and its allies are pursuing with Iran right now is the best path to get to Iran stopping a bomb from Iran and moving us in the right direction. The alternatives frankly are worse, we don't want Iran to have a bomb, we don't wanna have to use military action to stop it, and this is the best path we have right now. BOLLING: In your opinion Tom, but Rick there are other alternatives, sanctions on Iran were working by their own admission they were working. They said you got to help us out here, they're working too well. Is this the most dangerous path America could take putting a timeline on when they achieve that bomb? RICHARD GRENELL, FORMER ADVISOR TO FOUR US AMBASSADORS: Tom just took military action off the table. With his statement, he says things like, and this is what all the liberals do. Credible threat, but we really don't want to go to war and we have the Syria example and the Ukrainian example. This Obama deal on Iran is weaker than the UN deal. The UN said, including Russia and china in 2006 that all enrichment must stop. Obama since then has taken this issue out of the Security Council, brought in the Germans because they're extremely weak on this issue to get backing and has tried to come up with a deal that allows some enrichment. It's a terrible deal and it's a very weak deal. BOLLING: And it's based on trust. We've never been able to trust them. On two separate occasions when inspectors got close, or found things within Iran that they weren't supposed to be doing, the inspectors were thrown out of the country, and then Iran said let's come back to the bargaining table and re-negotiate. You can't trust these people. Why should we start trusting them now? GRENELL: This is not based on trust. This deal will be inspected by international monitors and verification. BOLLING: But, Tom two separate occasions international inspectors got close to seeing what they were up to, they didn't like it, and they tossed them. COLLINA: Let's look at the track record, over the last year; Iran has been under what's called the interim deal. It has been working very well. All the aspects of that deal, you'll probably try to raise accusations that the deal hasn't been respected. Those have been discredited. GRENELL: We just have to listen to the Iranians. BOLLING: Something no one's talking about here. Why does Iran need to enrich uranium for the energy sector? They can bring a barrel of oil out of the ground for about three or $4 a barrel and produce 3.2 million barrels a day. Explain why they're so anxious to get their hands on nuclear. COLLINA: I would be the first to agree that Iran does not need a nuclear power program, but it's their right to have one if they so choose, but only if they play by the rules. Do we have the inspections to make sure to verify (CROSSTALK) COLLINA: It's not too late. If we get a deal going forward, then we will have stronger inspections. (CROSSTALK) BOLLING: Hang on, Tom I want to bring Rick in. GRENELL: The whole idea that we're going to have inspectors that are going to somehow watch the Iranians and keep them in check is not based in reality. Let me tell you what they have reported. They've already told us the interim deal is not working. You look at all the other areas where they're doing RND. (CROSSTALK) GRENELL: That's not true. Those are false accusations. COLLINA: Those accusations -- you're -- the information you're talking about is past. It's wrong. It's out of date. Tom, hang on. Go ahead, Rick. GRENELL: The simple fact that the IAEA is not allowed going everywhere. When they are allowed to go in certain places and raise concerns, it's immediately dismissed by the left wingers who really just want to have a deal, any deal. And it's a dangerous... You're weaker than the UN. BOLLING: You have to consider Prime Minister Netanyahu did say this, a bad deal is worse than any deal at all. Rick and Tom, I have to leave it right there.

This is not a reality show. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States and what that means is that every candidate, every nominee needs to be subject to exacting standards and genuine scrutiny.

And I realize this is politics, and both parties can't resist getting their digs in, making cracks. some use crass language, some use a calm voice, but I do agree with president Obama. Running for president is not about entertainment. It's a very serious job, but let's be honest: It isn't just one party in the entertainment business. Remember President Obama's appearance on \"Between Two Ferns\"? Or what about being interviewed by a woman who is known for eating cereal out of a bathtub? That's not exactly hard-hitting news.

      "content": "This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" January 18, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: \u00a0Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Lisa Boothe, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling, and Meghan McCain, The Five. As our current president lets bombers, traders and crack dealers out of jail, it's President-elect Trump we should fear. Right, Carol? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAROL COSTELLO, CNN HOST: A lot of people in the country are scared, they're axiety-ridden. They want to hear something from him that says to them, you know what, it's going to be OK. But instead we are hearing from the combative Donald Trump. TOM BARRACK, COLONY CAPITAL CEO: And I understand that the feeling is that the president-elect himself is fueling this because he continues to be adversarial on issues he's concerned with. But at the same time. (CROSSTALK) COSTELLO: He is entrenching Americans in their camp. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Oh my God! She is the only Costello less serious than Lou. Now I get it. Trump sounds mean and Obama is so soothing he is like a cup of chamomile tea that drones people. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We have traveled the world together. We did a few singles, a few doubles together. I have offered advice that I thought was pretty sound, like don't do stupid stuff. And even when you complained about my long answers, I just want you to know that the only reason they were long was because you asked six-part questions. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Ha-ha-ha. Now, to that Dr. Jekyll, Trump is Mr. Hyde. He is loud, impulsive, a pissed off Creamsicle. The media says he is dividing America. Yet, few minded when Hillary called half of America irredeemable. Republicans are always demonized. Now, for once, we demonize back. Here is \"Joyless\" Behar from the knitting circle in hell. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"THE VIEW\"/ABC) JOY BEHAR, CO- HOST: Let's talk about what's going on right now because the inauguration of a certain person is happening on January 20th. (LAUGHTER) SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST: He who shall not be named. BEHAR: Right. It's happening January 20th. And there are millions of people who did not vote for him and who feel frightened. I run into people all the time. \"Joy, keep talking, we are scared, we don't know what to do.\" (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: No one says \"keep talking\" to Joy. Oh, the good old days when only liberals scared us -- the Weather Underground, the Black Panthers, FALN. The FALN killed many, they maimed cops, they terrorized cities. And now, President Obama just releases one. And you thought Bill Ayers was just a fluke. The lesson: When the left kills, it's romantic. A Republican is rude? Now that's evil. So as young leftists threaten campus security to a point where right-wing events are canceled and anti-Trump leftists plan to attack inaugural events, the media keep saying, \"People, beware of Trump.\" Perhaps projecting panic masks their bias. What the media does to Trump is what they did the cops -- say the police are really harmful, then later ask why people are so scared of the police. So they treat a Trump White House like a zombie apocalypse, hoping the mentality spreads. But one thing is clear: Judging from the last presser, the press adores President Obama. They still do. Yet they fear Trump. Change is good. All right, Eric. Let's be honest here, that was a pretty boring press release. (CROSSTALK) ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: \u00a0There were some interesting points on Chelsea Manning, voter fraud, fake news. There was some good stuff in there. But look, I actually felt bad for him. That was a long press conference. GUTFELD: Yeah. BOLLING: He made sure he got Fox, he got everyone on cable news. He went to Univision, LGBTQ TV, which I don't know there was one, there is one. \u00a0But on the way out, can you imagine, you're the most powerful human being on the planet for eight years. And in 48 hours, you're just one of us, Mr. President. Look, he didn't really make any news. He was asked about whatever it is, now 66 Democrats that are going to boycott the inauguration. \u00a0He docked that one as well. I think he was there as a final goodbye. GUTFELD: Yeah. You know, Meghan, the media loves him. I think it's because he's so much like them, like he is a coworker, but Trump is a boss. MEGHAN MCCAIN, GUEST CO-HOST: Well, you know, I gain all my strength by drinking the tears of liberals. So I love that everyone is having so much anxiety. I love the Joy Behar can't seem to get through a segment without saying the next president's name. Now, you know what it feels like to be me for the past eight years. Now you know how it feels like when I woke up and realize the Iran deal was going through. I love it. This is the time of change, the time has changed, and I'm glad that so many people are finally feeling what was like to be a conservative for the past eight years. GUTFELD: Lisa, I want to play a sot, that sound on tape for America. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: This is President Obama talking about the press' role. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: Well, I have enjoyed working with all of you. That does not of course mean that I've enjoyed every story that you have filed, but that's the point of this relationship. You are not supposed to be sycophants. \u00a0You're supposed to be skeptics. You're supposed to ask me tough questions. \u00a0You are not supposed to be complementary, but you are supposed to cast a critical eye on folks who hold enormous power. And make sure that we are accountable to the people who sent us here. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: In the middle of that, I regretted groaning because I forgot how boring it is. LISA BOOTHE, GUEST CO-HOST: I fell asleep. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: But there was a point to be made about how the press held him accountable. BOOTHE: Which is a complete joke because I think President Obama has probably received more leniency from the media than any other president that has preceded him. But here's the big problem. I think right now, we are seeing such an erosion of trust from Americans in various institutions, particularly the media. If you look up Gallup, the most recent poll, the trust the media is at an all-time low. And it's really counterproductive for people in the media to drive, just to sensationalize headlines, BuzzFeed in CNN running information about the unsubstantiated dossier because it just feeds the distrust in the media. And then, when the media actually tries to hold Donald Trump accountable on things that maybe he should be held accountable on, nobody is going to believe it. So it's incredibly counterproductive for them to continue this sort of mass hysteria. GUTFELD: Juan, you know, there's the media talking about how scary it is. \u00a0They're frightening children. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Yeah. GUTFELD: They are frightening children about what is going to happen with President Trump as Obama frees a bomber, FLN terrorist. That's kind of scary to me, right? WILLIAMS: You know, I would look at the specifics of the case. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I don't think it's that scary. But I must say thought the comments you just made, oh the press was so easy on Obama. I think we are sitting here at Fox News. I mean, Fox News has been absolutely tough on Obama. (CROSSTALK) BOOTHE: . that's not the case. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: OK. Whatever you want to say, whatever you want to say about our coverage, but I would say that the press has not exactly been a lapdog as described here for Obama. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: The press in general. (CROSSTALK) BOOTHE: I see tears coming from the reporters. WILLIAMS: There were several reporters there who did, as you said, seem like they were emotionally attached. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I thought that President Obama was directly speaking to president-elect Trump about the press. And don't forget that just today, president-elect Trump said we were going to have the press corps in the White House. And that has been put out there. Sean Spicer, our friend, said maybe they would move them out to the old executive office building, the Eisenhower Building. President Obama said it holds us accountable to have you guys here, that there is an important role. And apparently, I don't know if he puts direct pressure or spoke to president-elect Trump about it, but apparently that decision got reversed. BOOTHE: Well, BuzzFeed -- the criticism that President Obama has received, he can't even take because he has blamed Fox News, he blamed conservative radio for painting him in this negative light. And that's why you know people didn't like him or that's why his policies were perceived as failures to voters. So this little criticism he didn't receive throughout his presidency, he couldn't even handle. And don't you think that President Obama was treated to that same degree that soon-to-be President Trump was treated by the media, it might be a different circumstance as well, because you look at the coverage that Donald Trump received in the general election, 91 percent was negative? WILLIAMS: I believe that Donald Trump is a very different person. I think Greg pointed this out. If you listen to President Obama even at the risk of getting bored, he's not dropping bombs every minute, he's not attacking people, and he is not tweeting out attacks on people. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Well, that's OK. I hear you, but I hope you heard me. (CROSSTALK) MCCAIN: . in the last few days, it is like he is going through a checklist. It is like he is trying to make America as the least safe as possible internationally on his way out. And he's going to have to live with the legacy. And if you were so successful in the press, I do believe I agree with you, give him a favor. Anyone who spends any time around reporters knows how much they love him. Off the record, when they're drinking. And I certainly know that. (LAUGHTER) MCCAIN: But he, on his way out, you don't usher in the era of Trump if you haven't been an abysmal failure. It's such a pendulum swing. On the other side, you're not just talking about a conservative. You're talking about a populist movement that made his way to the White House. If you are so good of these policies, Hillary Clinton would be president. WILLIAMS: Well, I disagree. I think it is the fact that he's so cool the people want. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Wait no. He is so boring, Eric, that he could sneak stuff by Americans. (CROSSTALK) BOLLING: Look, so we have done stories about 90 percent of the press donations have gone to Democrats. The press is wildly leaning liberal. \u00a0They lean left. We know that's the case. Now, we have in the press briefing room, 90 percent of the people in that room are going what are we going to do now? (CROSSTALK) BOLLING: Please help us. Help us figure out what we're going to do with president-elect Donald Trump. When President Donald Trump is giving the briefing, they're freaking out. They are begging Obama to help figure out what the next four or eight years is going to look like. It's going to be -- the pendulum is going to swing exactly the other way, where you guys are going to be seen as the hostile press to President Donald Trump, much the same way that President Obama saw Fox News as hostile to him. GUTFELD: Did they even ask about the FLAN and terrorist? I kind of tuned out. So it might be my fault. But I don't think it ever came up. That's kind of weird. If I'm wrong, let me know. I'm sure they will. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I think that they don't want him to go. They don't want him to go. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Let me tell you, as someone who has been a Washington reporter, the press corps has a lot of trouble with Obama in terms of pursuing leaks, going after people, prosecuting them. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Historical high in terms of that kind of treatment of reporters. \u00a0But when you hear the prospect -- I mean, we know their reality. Donald Trump during the campaign saying I don't want to -- I am taking away the credentials of the Washington Post or I have the crowd shouting and screaming at the press. That's a whole different ball of wax. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: All right. We got to move on. More from President Obama's final news conference when The Five returns. Plus, a live report from Houston where former President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara are in the hospital, an update on their condition ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Welcome back to The Five. We want to bring you up to speed now on the health of former president George H.W. Bush. The 92-year-old was admitted to an intensive care unit today in Texas. His wife Barbara was also hospitalized as a precaution. More now from Fox's Casey Stegall outside Houston Methodist Hospital with the latest. Casey. CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Juan. Good to see you. You know, we've been told all morning long that doctors were quote very pleased about the progress that the former president was making since he was admitted here to the hospital over the weekend. In fact, there was some talk of a potential discharge, that that could happen. But then, this afternoon, things changed. A spokesperson for the president came out and said that Mr. Bush was moved to intensive care for treatment of a respiratory issue relating to pneumonia. Now, a spokesperson for the president says Mr. Bush was moved, and doctors say that the 92-year-old was sedated, so that his airway could be cleared and secured. He's now said to be stable and resting comfortably, as is his wife, Barbara. The former first lady was also admitted to the exact same hospital here in Houston this morning, after she started experiencing fatigue and coughing. \u00a0Staffers say this was done as a precaution. But earlier in his final press conference, President Obama shared these words about the former first family. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: They have not only dedicated their lives to this country, they have been a constant source of friendship and support and good counsel for Michelle and me over the years. They are as fine a couple as we know. And so, we want to send our prayers and our love to them. Really good people. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEGALL: President Bush spent a week at Methodist Hospital, if you remember back in 2014, through the Christmas holiday when he was also treated for shortness of breath. Then the following year, the elder Bush was hospitalized in May after breaking a vertebra in his neck from falling at their Kennebunkport home. For now, the President and Mrs. Bush, the former first lady, resting comfortably here at Methodist Hospital back behind me, no word on when they could be discharged from the hospital. \u00a0Guys. WILLIAMS: Thank you so much, Casey. Back now to President Obama's final news conference today, right off the bat, he was asked about his decision to commute the sentence of former army private Chelsea Manning. She leaked classified information to WikiLeaks. \u00a0The president explains. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: Let's be clear. Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence, so the notion that the average person who is thinking about disclosing vital classified information, would think that it goes unpunished, I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served. He had served a significant amount of time that it made sense to commute and not pardon her sentence. And I feel very comfortable that justice has been served and that a message has still been sent. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Well, Eric, seven years, but the president says it's time to have some clemency. (CROSSTALK) BOLLING: I have no idea. This is insane. Justice has been served? \u00a0Chelsea Manning, Bradley Manning, Chelsea Manning got 35 years for violating the Espionage Act, stealing government property, violation of computer fraud, government fraud, multiple counts of disobeying orders, and leaking three-quarters of a million documents to WikiLeaks. But for a lot of people, that would put military members on risk. That's very different from some of the other things President Obama may be referring to, namely Snowden, who else, Bergdahl, this guy, gal now, put a lot of Americans at risk, maybe people died because of some of the things that were leaked. At one point, we were going to go after Chelsea Manning or Bradley Manning for treason, a capital crime. WILLIAMS: Right. BOLLING: In other words, open to the death penalty. And now, President Obama commutes the sentence after he said seven years. It's three years since the conviction. So I think this is insane. I think you're absolutely telling people who may be thinking about it, you know, seven years. I don't know, if you get 35 and no chance of parole, that's a different story than getting out in seven years. WILLIAMS: Greg, it's 10 times longer than the next harshest sentence, which was given to a former FBI agent for doing the same thing, 20 times as long as the most severe sentence ever given for any such action prior to the Obama administration. GUTFELD: Maybe this was a different action. I mean, you know, if you're questioning the initial sentence, that's a different argument, but the fact is he didn't serve the prison sentence. And why did he not serve the prison sentence? Because he or she is a folk hero. Understand if anybody here at this table got into serious legal trouble that involved jail time, we are never going to enjoy the same vast amount of sympathy that Chelsea Manning gets right now from the press and from the government because she is an antiwar activist. She is a gender activist. You put those two together, you are a folk hero. We would never get that kind of mercy. The one thing, with the exception of Eric, he came out strongly, a lot of conservatives are going to have a hard time saying that. Because if you condemn Manning, how do you cheer Assange? And that's what you haven't been hearing from a lot of conservatives because it's put them in a tight spot. (CROSSTALK) BOLLING: On the heels of that, so what are the Democrats doing now? Right now, they are berating Julian Assange and WikiLeaks saying this guy needs to be brought to justice and then President Obama pardons, commutes the sentence, of someone who put Julian Assange on the map with WikiLeaks. (CROSSTALK) BOLLING: So what is President Obama telling the Democrats? (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I'm going to say there's a big difference. This woman pleaded guilty. She went through the military criminal justice. MCCAIN: So what? No, I'm sorry. When my brother is deployed and fighting ISIS, which by the way, defense officials have said that her release of these documents led to the rise of ISIS and the Arab Spring, so while she is making all of our diplomats, intelligence officials, and troops left safe overseas, that's OK because she sorry. It's not good enough. Our president is sending a signal out to the rest of the world that leaks are appropriate as long as you said you are a folk hero, you're an antiwar activist, and you are whatever else. The hypocrisy, I don't want to touch that. (CROSSTALK) MCCAIN: Honestly, the hypocrisy in all of it and what it is sending to our intelligence communities and the men and women who fight so hard for our national security is as long as you're a traitor and you have the right kind of politics, it won't matter. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: In fact, Ash Carter, the defense secretary, opposes this. (CROSSTALK) BOOTHE: It is blatant hypocrisy from the left because they're the ones driving this anti-WikiLeaks, anti-Russian narrative. But alternatively, it's perfectly okay for this individual to put out 750,000 documents, details of American operations, identity of American allies, the New York Times noted in an article that they write about this, the fact that foreign allies in various countries were helping United States. They had to remove them and put them in safety because this individual put them in harm's way. \u00a0It's not only blatant hypocrisy from the left and the President of the United States, President Obama, but it's also purely political to Greg's earlier point. (CROSSTALK) MCCAIN: If it weren't political, General Petraeus would be getting a pardon right now, which by the way is shameful that he's getting a pass for Chelsea Manning and not for General Petraeus, given what he did for this country and Chelsea Manning did. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Assange said he would come back if this happened. GUTFELD: Maybe so, but I'm wondering why not pardon the bomber or Eric Rudolph. You just let out a bomber and a traitor because you disagree with our politics. The bomber politics are not as romantic as the FALN according to a leftist. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Eric Rudolph is pro-life. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I think Chelsea Manning was found guilty. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: FALN is to me worse. WILLIAMS: OK. All right. Another very busy day on Capitol Hill with confirmation hearings for four more of president-elect Trump's nominees. \u00a0If you did not have time to watch them all, we've got you covered, the highlights when The Five returns. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOLLING: More hearings on the Hill for president-elect Donald Trump's nominees. We've got highlights. First up, the man picked to oversee the dismantling of Obamacare, Dr. Tom Price. Senator Bernie Sanders tried his hardest to create some drama while questioning the HHS nominee. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT.: Do you believe that healthcare is a right of all Americans, whether they are rich or poor? SEN. TOM PRICE, R-GA., HHS NOMINEE: We are a compassionate society. SANDERS: No, we're not a compassionate society. In terms of our relationship to poor and working people, our record is worse than virtually any other country. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty on any major country on earth, and half of our senior, older workers have nothing set aside for retirement. So I don't think, compared to other countries, we are particularly compassionate. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOLLING: Elizabeth Warren also went after Price. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRICE: The stock was bought by a broker who is making those decisions. I wasn't making those decisions. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MASS.: This is someone who buys the stocks you want him to buy. PRICE: Not true. WARREN: So when you bailed out. PRICE: That's not true, Senator. What I did was comply with the rules of the house in an ethical and legal and aboveboard manner. (CROSSTALK) WARREN: Did you take additional actions after that date to advance your plan to help the company that you now own stock in? PRICE: I am offended by the insinuations, Senator. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOLLING: All right. We will start with Greg. And we go to Bernie Sanders first? GUTFELD: Yeah. BOLLING: He was making a couple of points. It is right along the lines of his presidency. GUTFELD: He hasn't changed. God love him. He should have been the nominee, and he's bitter. But this is another boring example of team sport politics. Instead of shirts and skins, it's Republicans and Democrats. \u00a0It's not shirts and skins. (CROSSTALK) BOLLING: They are all going to go. You know what it is, it's a shooting gallery, if you are a liberal, because you show up and take your shots. GUTFELD: And for a Republican, you're basically, like, in a baby nursery. \u00a0You come over, you coo, you say, \"Hello, hi,\" and then that's it. BOLLING: And at one point, Elizabeth Warren complained. Like, she said, \"I only got 7 minutes. My colleague got two extra minutes.\" And she went back and forth with Lamar Alexander and wasted another minute of additional time. GUTFELD: Awesome. WILLIAMS: I love -- by the way, shirts and skins, that was terrific. GUTFELD: It's a bad image. WILLIAMS: But I must say, you know, we've seen people lose cabinet positions because of their babysitter. I remember Tom Daschle, right? \u00a0Bill Richardson. There are a lot of Democrats who did get torpedoed. I don't know if Price gets torpedoed, but the fact is the investment was made one day. He introduces a bill the next day. He makes money the third day. \u00a0If you were, you know, following the money, you'd be like, \"Hmm, something is going on.\" BOLLING: And if you follow the money, there's a lot of that going on, both sides of the aisle. BOOTHE: Well, absolutely. And look, the reason the Democratic Party is doing this is because they don't have any other options. Their only option is to try to exploit these various issues in people's lives like they're trying to do with his labor secretary twice, as well, in the hope that they'll push them out. Because they don't have the numbers to stop any of the cabinet choices for President Trump. So this is literally all they are left with. And to the Democratic Party right now, these cabinet choices are the enemies, because you're talking about people that want to fundamentally change the agency that they are going to take over. So they are enemy No. 1 to the Democratic Party right now. BOLLING: Meghan, your thoughts on Price's hearing today? MCCAIN: What I want is for Senator Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to answer to someone from Arizona, where the premiums went up over 150 percent, and you could only have one healthcare provider in every single county in the state of Arizona except one. I want one of those people to ask him a question about what it's like to pay over 150 percent in premiums. Because this delusion of this utopian socialist society that he espoused forever that I had to sit here and cover, holding my nose, it's over. Your dream is over. The American public universally rejected it. And they look so bitter and delusional. And I just -- I agree with you. I think at this point, it's just grandstanding for the cameras. BOLLING: Can I throw this real quickly, producers? I hope I can. Another sound bite exchange between Senator Sanders and Congressman Tom Price. \u00a0This one on skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. (END VIDEO CLIP) SANDERS: We are paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. You don't disagree with that, do you? PRICE: I think that's the case. I'd have to look at the statistics, but I think there are a lot of reasons for that; and if we get to the root cause of what that is, then I think we can actually solve it a bipartisan way, solve it together. SANDERS: Well, one of the root causes is that every major country on earth negotiates drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry. In our country, the drug companies can raise their prices. Today they could double their prices. There is no law to prevent them from doing that. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOLLING: Now, you may -- Juan, this may surprise you. I agree with Bernie Sanders on this one. WILLIAMS: Is that right? BOLLING: I think this is -- Medicare is not allowed to negotiate with big pharma over prices they want to charge. And I think this is a big mistake we're making here. Now I know the reasons why they put that into the Medicare Part D years ago. But still, competition. Let's bring some competition, bring prices down. No? WILLIAMS: Well, you know, you stun me. BOLLING: Why's that? WILLIAMS: Because -- because I agree with you. I don't understand it, but I think this has been overwhelming. Even the other day Cory Booker, the senator from New Jersey, big Democrat, he voted against a bill that would allow drugs to be brought in from overseas, because so many pharmaceutical companies located in New Jersey. And I think Republicans have always said, \"Oh, yes, you know, America is the place of innovation, and we pay a Price. The rest of the world comes here for medical care.\" And they excuse the fact that, for our seniors, drug prices are intolerably high. GUTFELD: Are you saying we should have drugs from other countries? WILLIAMS: Good drugs. BOOTHE: Isn't that already happening? BOLLING: But it's one of those quirky rules where they say Medicare, who can buy in mass, is not -- they have to -- they have to pay what these pharmaceuticals demand. GUTFELD: Free-market is always better than the hand of government. So wherever you introduce competition, prices go down. However, drugs are expensive for a reason. BOLLING: Yes. GUTFELD: Because some of... BOLLING: R&D. GUTFELD: There are patients -- there are rare diseases, so the drug costs a lot of money, because not a lot people are buying it. But then the cheaper drugs help pay for that. You hope that happens. BOLLING: So what happens is that -- I know they want us to tease -- but what happens is it's the same -- you know, there's a Canadian drug that does the same thing, and we're not allowed to buy it. Look, this is one of the things I agree with the Democrats on. Sorry, guys, we've got to cut out of it. BOOTHE: I feel like we should sing \"Kumbaya.\" BOLLING: More from today's confirmation hearings. These guys will get in in a second later. And ahead, former President Bush, 41, can't attend Mr. Trump's inauguration on Friday. He wrote the president-elect a beautiful letter to explain why. \u00a0We'll show that to you coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MCCAIN: Back now with more on today's hearings on the Hill. The president-elect nominated Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA. Here's a little bit of what he faced from lawmakers today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump has called global warming a hoax caused by the Chinese. Do you agree that global warming is a hoax? SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR NOMINEE: I do not, Senator. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So Donald Trump is wrong? PRUITT: I do not believe that climate change is a hoax. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. That's important for the president to hear. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCCAIN: South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley went on the offensive at her confirmation hearing earlier. She's in the running for ambassador to the United Nations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. NIKKI HALEY, R-S.C., U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N. NOMINEE: Like most government agencies, we could benefit from a fresh set of eyes. I will take an outsiders look at the institution. Nowhere has the U.N.'s failure been more consistent and more outrageous than it is -- than its bias against our close ally, Israel. Russia is trying to show their muscle right now. It is what they do. We need to let them know we are not OK with what happened in Ukraine and Crimea and what is happening in Syria. But we're also going to tell them that we do need their help with ISIS and with some other threats that we all share. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCCAIN: All right. I'm going to start with you, Lisa. Do you think it is a possible with this administration to mend all of the fences that have been just decimated with our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel? BOOTHE: You know, I think it's going to be tough, but I think we need to see some leadership; and I really think that's, you know, part of the reason why Donald Trump was elected, because Americans have felt that there is this vacuum in the country as far as our leadership on the world stage and being perceived as incredibly weak. You know, in regards to these hearings, to the point earlier, we're talking about we just saw two people who are very critical of the organizations that they're going to be assuming or looking over. Nikki Haley was talking about the fact that other U.N. members are not paying their fair share, which is something that Donald Trump had been talking about, as well. You look at Scott Pruitt. He wants to roll back this egregious overreach we've seen from the EPA, which was struck down, or at least blocked by the Supreme Court with a clean power plant. So I think this is a great thing that we have people that are questioning, you know, the various organizations and places that they're going to have purview over, because I think it's desperately needed in the country right now. MCCAIN: What do you think of Nikki Haley as U.N. ambassador, Juan? WILLIAMS: I'm all for it. You know, I thought what she said today was that U.S. leadership is necessary and needed. Now, she got into something that is a little surprising, which was we make, the United States, 22 percent of the contribution to the United Nations, as you said. Are we getting what we pay for? I mean, the United Nations is here. I think we exercise some influence there. And it was a good idea post-World War II. So I just hope that she doesn't think this is a financial transaction. MCCAIN: Yes. Some of her comments on Russia in regards to the Ukraine and Syria is a little bit of a tone shift from President Trump and what he said on the campaign trail. Do you think they'll be able to meet in the middle? BOLLING: So President Obama, in the A-block, I think we did point -- play that sound bite, saying the president -- the next administration shouldn't surround themselves with sycophants. Remember? Look what you've gotten in these hearings. You've had from Pruitt today on climate change, Nikki Haley on Russia, Rex Tillerson the other day on Russia. Harder line then Donald Trump has been. Jeff Sessions on waterboarding. General Mattis on waterboarding and involvement in other conflicts. You have people who are pushing back against some of the things that Donald Trump has said. And that is the strength, and to Donald Trump's credit, that he didn't surround himself with people who would say the exact same thing he says. He's stacking his cabinet with people with diverse opinions, and that's when a good leader does. He hears what you have to say, his top people, and then make decisions from that. MCCAIN: Greg, do you think you're going to listen to them? GUTFELD: I hope so. I mean, I want to -- I want to talk. We didn't get to Betsy Da-vose... BOLLING: DeVos. GUTFELD: DeVos. WILLIAMS: DeVos. BOLLING: I just find it interesting. You know, she's for school choice, and that upsets a lot of these people. There's a liberal rule that you're only for choice when it comes to terminating a life but not educating one, which I think it's interesting. And then if you look back at the people that are going after Price, because he's critical of the EPA, I find it strange how the left can herald, like, the most violent critics of government, people who go after the military or leak or try to bomb the military, but if you're a critic of government bureaucracy, somehow that's evil. If you don't like the EPA, that's somehow worse than a guy planning bombs in -- you know, at military dances. MCCAIN: Wow. GUTFELD: Thank you. MCCAIN: Drop the mike on that one, Greg. GUTFELD: I banned that phrase. MCCAIN: You did? GUTFELD: Yes. MCCAIN: You know, I love that they're all sort of every Democrat's worst nightmare. GUTFELD: They're adults. MCCAIN: And if we have to talk about climate change one more time... GUTFELD: They're adults. The children have left the room. They're in the basement eating ice cream. These are all the adults, sitting around playing bridge. MCCAIN: Yes. WILLIAMS: A bunch of billionaires. MCCAIN: All right. In two days, President-elect Trump is going to deliver his highly-anticipated inaugural address. Want to know the first thing he's going to say? He just revealed it to Fox News. Hear it next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BOOTHE: Well, we are 24 hours away from inauguration eve, and \"The Five\" is headed to Washington, D.C. You don't want to miss our live coverage from the National Mall tomorrow and Friday. But ahead of the big day, \"Fox & Friends\" cohost Ainsley Earhardt got an exclusive interview with the president-elect. She asked him what he's going to say in his inaugural address and also more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AINSLEY EARHARDT, CO-HOST, \"FOX & FRIENDS\": What's the first line? PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I have prepared it. Well, the first line is thanking everybody, all of the presidents and including, by the way, President Obama and Michelle, who have been absolutely nice. I'm just thanking President Obama, and I'm thanking his very lovely wife, because they have been so gracious. EARHARDT: What's the first thing you're going to do when you walk into the White House? TRUMP: Well, I want to go to work. Monday is really the day that we start signing and working and making great deals for the country. EARHARDT: Your first night in the White House, will your whole family be there? TRUMP: My whole family is going to be in the White House. Baron and Melania and all of my children will be in the White House, which is sort of a tradition. They say the first night, you have your family there. (END VIDEOTAPE) BOOTHE: Well, Eric, obviously, Friday is a big moment for the president, because -- President Trump, because he's really going to set the precedent and the tone for his presidency. You know what he said, that he's going to thank President Obama, Michelle Obama. But what else do you think we're going to hear from him? BOLLING: So I think Sean Spicer said it's going to be around 20 minutes, which is fairly short and right to the point. And I also understand that he's only going to do a couple of the inaugural balls. Typically, the president will do a lot of them. The parade is going to be shorter. So I think he's going to keep a lower key, believe it or not. As big and out there as he was during the campaign, he's going to swear in with a lower footprint, I guess. I found a very interesting -- Axios, Mike Allen's new newsletter is fantastic. You've got to pick it up if you haven't. There was an interview with President-elect Donald Trump. \"Make America great again\" started in 2012. When Romney lost, he said he was looking for the right brand for a presidential run. It started with \"Make America great,\" and he felt that was demeaning to America, so he added the \"again.\" And he branded. He bought that for 300 bucks in 2012. I mean, the guy is -- look, he was meant to be sitting right there in 48 hours with his right hand up. BOOTHE: And I find that interesting, and I want to talk about that, as well. And so Juan, considering the fact that he trademarked this in 2012, obviously, there was a lot of foresight there in, you know, sort of potentially wanting to run for president one day. You know, just to what degree has he been underestimated, considering the fact that obviously this was something that he was looking towards back in 2012? WILLIAMS: I don't think there's any question he's been underestimated. \u00a0He's been underestimated by Republicans, by Democrats. I think there's a certain genius to him. I don't always think that he's doing good. \u00a0Sometimes I think it gets the better of him. It gets out of control and he starts tweeting in the middle of the night. But the fact is, this is a very, I mean, brilliant guy who found something in the American public mind that was compelling that other people did not see. So you've got to take your hat off to him. BOOTHE: How much... WILLIAMS: Your \"Make America great again\" hat. BOOTHE: Well, how much do you think that branding is going to help him in moving some of these policy initiatives forward, Meghan? MCCAIN: I mean, I think branding is everything. But in regards to the inauguration I have a little bit of a confession to make to you, Lisa. It's not that I don't care what Donald Trump is going to say, but I want a camera on Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and Chelsea Clinton the entire time. And I want to sit back and watch the reaction on their faces. BOOTHE: There will be cheers for you to drink. Greg. GUTFELD: Well, the question about Hillary is will she wear the outfit that she had picked for the inauguration when she assumed she was going to be president? Because that's going to be sad wearing that. But you know what? That answer, the -- like the -- what's the first thing you would do in the White House when you move in is a great question. I would have the greatest game of hide and seek you could ever imagine. I would play it all night, and I would raid the liquor cabinet. So I would have the wildest first night in the White House. BOOTHE: Maybe -- maybe that's why you're not going to be president. GUTFELD: Not yet anyway, but there's still time. I'm only in my early 30s. BOOTHE: Are you eyeing 2020? GUTFELD: 2024. BOOTHE: You and Kanye. He's 2024 now. BOLLING: 2024? BOOTHE: Right. BOLLING: Blue pantsuit, you think? GUTFELD: I think it will be a tasteful pantsuit. BOLLING: Yes. WILLIAMS: On Obama? GUTFELD: Those will be mom jeans. WILLIAMS: OK, mom jeans. BOOTHE: On this very important note, we are going to have to move on. \u00a0\"One More Thing\" is coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: \"One More Thing\" -- Juan. WILLIAMS: Well, President-elect Donald Trump doesn't move into the White House until Friday, but a replica has already moved into the Oval Office at Madam Tussaud's in London. While this only required the moving of one wax figure to transition the White House, in reality, boy, that's tough -- about 100 White House staffers have only five hours between Obama's departure and Trump's arrival. In that time, so much has to be done, even like, changing the toothpaste, to stocking the first family's private pantry, and of course, a crew from the National Archives will go through a sweep and pick up remaining documents from the old administration. It's exhausting just to read about it. GUTFELD: You know what they're going to find? They're going to find packs of cigarettes hidden all over the White House. They're going to be where I used to hide them. They'll be in planters. They'll be... BOLLING: Outside. GUTFELD: They'll be outside. BOLLING: So Michelle couldn't smell them. GUTFELD: And always have to be -- you'd put them out, and you'd bury them in the ground. BOLLING: Got to remember where you buried them. MCCAIN: Sounds delightful. GUTFELD: It is. Eric. BOLLING: Like a squirrel, right? GUTFELD: Yes, yes. BOLLING: They don't remember where they bury stuff. OK, so I think it was the Washington Times put this piece out today. It's fantastic. President Obama and the family and Michelle, they're going to leave the White House worth $24 million, which that, in itself, is amazing, considering the salary has been $400,000 a year over eight years, and they're taxed on it. But check out what's next. They predict this: $200,000 speeches. I think that number is going to be low. Thirty million dollars in memoirs and books. Two hundred thousand dollar salaries going forward. Their estimate -- I'm not sure if it was Washington Times or another outside group -- $242 million in the next ten or 15 years. GUTFELD: I think that's low. BOLLING: That seems to be way low. GUTFELD: It's 2.42 billion. BOLLING: I agree with you. WILLIAMS: A billion? GUTFELD: Yes, yes. BOLLING: It's good to be president. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: It's also good to be a best-selling author. He made a lot of that money off the book. BOLLING: It was worth it, right? Probably sold... GUTFELD: Of course he wrote it, right? WILLIAMS: He did. He did write it. GUTFELD: I'm kidding. Of course he wrote it. I'm joking. All right. It's my turn. Hey... (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Greg's Robot News (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: This is some chilling news out of Europe. The European parliament has voted to give artificial intelligence and robots, get this, electronic personhood. That means robots, in time, will have rights. They will actually have rights. So if you have your futuristic toaster and it burns your bagel and you smack it, that toaster can sue you or have you charged, have you arrested. \u00a0Your appliances now will own you. That's why be nice to your refrigerator now, because they'll have a memory. They'll have a memory put in it. See, I told you this was going to happen. I've been telling everybody. BOLLING: I actually think you're going to be right now. GUTFELD: I'm scared. BOLLING: We're that crazy to allow this stuff to happen. GUTFELD: It's going to happen. Meghan. MCCAIN: My \"One More Thing.\" Obviously, everyone here at Fox News wishes George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush a healthy and speedy recovery. But George H.W. Bush cannot attend the inauguration, and he penned a letter to Trump on missing it. He said, \"Barbara and I are so sorry we can't be there for your inauguration on January 20. My doctor says if I sit outside in January, it's likely it will put me 6 feet under. Same for Barbara, so I guess we're stuck in Texas.\" And he goes on. I always love that George H.W. Bush has such a great sense of humor. He's always gracious. And I just thought it was funny. GUTFELD: Yes. MCCAIN: Donald Trump has thanked him for it, on Twitter. For that letter. GUTFELD: Well, let's hope he gets better. All right. Lisa. BOOTHE: Well, mine is this Women's -- so-called Women's March that is going to be on Saturday. Because it's just a complete farce. I mean, it's just divisive politics from the left under the guise of inclusiveness. But my biggest bone to pick is with the media, who's fawning over it, like ABC, \"Good Morning America\" today fawning over this march without any mention of the fact that pro-life groups are being excluded. And it also just cuts to the heart of a disingenuous narrative from the media about the issue of pro-life and abortion. The country is completely split on the issue. If you also look at the so-called heartbeat bill that was being led as controversial by the media, Ohioans were split on that issue, as well. So I'm just completely fed up with this, and I'm done with it. WILLIAMS: Wait a second. Wait a second. I don't think pro-life people are being excluded. They were not welcome in terms of the leadership. BOOTHE: They were originally going, and then they were being excluded. WILLIAMS: Their name on the leadership. But I think there are a lot of pro-life women who are joining the march. BOOTHE: That's not all-inclusive. That's not representative of all women. GUTFELD: All right. We've got -- we've got to roll. That's it for us today. But we will see you live from Washington, D.C., on inauguration eve. You might hear about that. It's coming up. \"Special Report\" is up next.

      "content": " In his second term as president, gun-control proponent Barack Obama inadvertently became the No. 1 moneymaker for the firearms industry. The past 18 months, in particular, have seen record-breaking gun sales. But with Donald Trump now at the national helm, and the immediate threat of new federal gun restrictions fizzling, the industry is facing a threat of a different kind: an uncertain economic future and a sudden jam in purchases. \"We don't expect a collapse, we expect organic growth that isn't all fear-driven,\"\u00a0Lawrence Keane, senior vice president, government and public affairs, for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, told\u00a0FoxNews.com.\u00a0\"We are likely to see the market normalize, which is better for the industry long term. It\u00a0is hard to respond to constant spikes. Slow and steady wins the race.\" The biggest players in the firearms industry convened in Las Vegas this week for the world's largest trade show of its kind, the NSSF-helmed annual Shot Show, where much of the focus was \u2013 quite calmly \u2013 on what will happen next. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump routinely voiced his support for the Second Amendment and pledged that, if elected, he would abolish gun-free zones in schools and military bases and quickly repeal a number of Obama's executive actions, including efforts to streamline the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' background checks on gun buyers. TRUMP'S PRO-SECOND AMENDMENT PLATFORM COULD END GUN SALES BOOM But Sandy Zusman, marketing director for Glock, said the industry is still standing by to see exactly what will happen under Trump, who has become notorious for defying expectations. \"The last two years have been exceptional for the industry, much of it driven by the very public discussions Obama had about gun control,\" he said. \"Those discussions have grown quiet now, but everyone is waiting to see the new path. There has been a slowing down of demand; we expect to focus more on individual needs of gun owners now.\" The post-Obama world also means that manufacturers are having to redirect marketing tactics and zero in on more niche audiences. In particular, many are figuring out ways to reach the fast-growing female market, designing products suitable for women's personal defense. \"There has been a huge spike in all-female classes for concealed carry and for competition,\" said Anette Wachter, member of the U.S National Rifle team and founder of a shooting blog,\u00a030CalGirl.com. Almost all the major manufactures at the Shot Show included females in their marketing materials and advertisements, and not \u2013 in Wachter's words \u2013 in an old, stereotypical \"gun booth babe\" sense, but portraying the legitimate need for women to bear arms and protect themselves. Shot Show vendor Drew Vedenhaupt pointed out that the market is still in its post-election \"artificially inflated\" stage, in which many manufacturers overproduced inventory in expectation of panic sales following a presumed Hillary Clinton victory. He said companies are now being forced to sell the overstock at next to no profit to free up room for a new wave of consumer demands. \"We expect customers to take more time with purchasing decisions, and they will turn to buy accessories and things that they really desire \u2013 like stylized optics or suppressors,\" Vedenhaupt noted. GUN-RIGHTS GROUPS HOPE TRUMP NIXES SOCIAL SECURITY ROLE IN BACKGROUND CHECKS The industry also appears to be turning its targets toward products suitable for the ever-growing arena of competition shooting, which has taken the place of recreational hunting in recent years. According to Vedenhaupt, hunting has fallen into a \"flat\" phase \u2013 mostly due to the federal government buying up more and more parcels of land and thus limiting land access. The decrease in hunting has encouraged consumers to gather for more \"group shoots\" and invest time and money in competition instead. The industry is also gearing up for the high possibility that, with the Republican House and Senate, the newly introduced Reciprocity Act of 2017 will pass under the Trump administration. The controversial measure, which has been referred to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, would enable concealed carry licenses to function much like driver's licenses in the U.S. \u2013 meaning they would be lawfully recognized across state lines. Many firearms-related companies are therefore specializing in accessories and clothing for the concealed carry consumer. At the 5.11 Tactical booth, for example, the Shot Show hit was seemingly ordinary jeans and pants, made with defender flex denim that enables full range of motion as well as coin pockets deep enough for a knife and\u00a0hidden carry pockets to shroud a handgun and a magazine. \"We want to provide things that are comfortable and look good,\" President Francisco J. Morales said. \"But with extra functions.\" And while gun makers and lobbyists have a renewed sense of ease at the federal level, they expect the fight to continue in the states as politicians and gun-control groups push for a tightening of laws and restrictions, especially in blue states. In California, for one, the November election saw a host of new laws come into play, including the registration of bullet-button guns and the imposition of ammunition purchase licensing. But overall, despite the business slowdown, Trump's triumph has been a welcome relief for the firearms industry. \"It has been a very steady Shot Show,\" added Kevin Thomas, sales and marketing manager for Lapua Cartridges and Components. \"There is a sense of optimism among the community that has been missing for the last few years.\"",

      "author": "Gregg Re",
      "content": " President Trump invoked on Sunday past pro-border security comments by two unlikely political adversaries -- Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton -- as the ongoing partial federal government shutdown over border wall funding enters its third week. In a pair of early-morning posts on Twitter, Trump,\u00a0who later headed to a meeting with advisers at Camp David to discuss border security,\u00a0also seemingly addressed reports that the prolonged shutdown will end up costing the government more than the $5 billion he has requested for the wall, writing that in the end, a \"properly planned and constructed Wall will pay for itself many times a year!\" Trump's remarks underscored his apparent\u00a0unwillingnesss to compromise on securing at least some of the border wall funding he has demanded, despite the insistence of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Democrats will never pay for a wall. However, in an interview\u00a0broadcast Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told host Chuck Todd that Trump \"was willing to agree, and he mentioned this at the Rose Garden press conference, to take a concrete wall off the table.\" Mulvaney had met with senior congressional officials on Saturday to try to make progress on a compromise, although he suggested the encounter had been mostly unproductive. IN SITUATION ROOM MEETING, SCHUMER, PELOSI INTERRUPT DHS SECRETARY WITHIN 5 SECONDS \"Again, what's driving this is the president's desire to change the conditions at the border,\" Mulvaney said. \"And if he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence in order to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore' that should help us move in the right direction.\" On Twitter, the president intimated that\u00a0cynical political considerations were motivating Democrats' rejection of wall funding. Pelosi and other Democrats have suggested they would be willing to fund general border security efforts, but not a wall. (The president has told Democrats the shutdown could last more than a year.) \u201c'We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked...'\u201d Barrack Obama, 2005,\" Trump wrote on Sunday, quoting the former president in 2005. Then-Sen. Obama made the remarks at a press conference with then-Florida GOP\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Mel Martinez, as part of a bipartisan effort to address illegal immigration. PELOSI TO DHS SECRETARY: 'I REJECT\u00a0YOUR FACTS' Obama's full quote at the time: \"We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States, undetected, undocumented, unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants in this country.\" \"We all agree on the need to better secure the border and to punish employers who choose to hire illegal immigrants,\" Obama added.\u00a0\"We are a generous and welcoming people, here in the United States, but those who enter the country illegally, and those who employ them, disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law.\" Obama went on to advocate for imposing a \"hefty fine\" on those already in the country illegally, as well as tighter border security measures. In his post, Trump also provided a partial quote from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, emphasizing her support for the\u00a0Secure Fence Act of 2006. That legislation passed by an overwhelming 80-19 majority, and was backed by Obama, as well. \"I voted, when I was a Senator, to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in...\u201d Hillary Clinton, 2015,\" Trump wrote. At a campaign stop in November 2015, Clinton told a crowd: \"I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in. And I do think you have to control your borders.\" Trump continued: \"The only reason they do not want to build a Wall is that Walls Work! 99% of our illegal Border crossings will end, crime in our Country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year! A properly planned and constructed Wall will pay for itself many times a year!\" Last week, former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly flatly asserted\u00a0in an interview with The Los Angeles Times that the president's proposed border project \"is not a wall\" and that all plans for a concrete wall were abandoned long ago -- directly contradicting the White House's repeated claims. In a series of Twitter posts last month, Trump insisted that \"we are not building a Concrete Wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it.\" But Kelly's comments were seemingly at odds with the president's multiple tweets calling for \"money to finish the Wall,\" as well as his promises during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. \"To be honest, it\u2019s not a wall,\u201d Kelly said\u00a0in\u00a0an interview with The Los Angeles Times. \u201cThe president still says \u2018wall\u2019 \u2014 oftentimes frankly he\u2019ll say \u2018barrier\u2019 or \u2018fencing,\u2019 now he\u2019s tended toward steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.\" Pelosi, after regaining the speakership this week, made clear that no wall of any kind was on the table. \"We\u2019re not doing a wall,\" Pelosi told reporters. \"Does anybody have any doubt about that? We are not doing a wall. So that\u2019s that.\u00a0It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with: The wall is an immorality between countries. It\u2019s an old way of thinking [and] it isn\u2019t cost-effective.\u201d At one point during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, according to the\u00a0Wall Street Journal, Pelosi interrupted\u00a0Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen while she was citing statistics related to the border, including how many criminal illegal immigrants attempted to enter the U.S. last year. \u201cI reject your facts,\u201d Pelosi told Nielsen.",
