      "content": "From the publisher: An explosive, whistle-blowing expos\u00e9, \"Exonerated: The Failed Takedown of Donald Trump by the Swamp\" reveals how Deep State actors relied on a cynical plug-and-play template to manufacture the now-discredited Russiagate scandal. With the cutting analysis and insight he exhibited in his blockbuster bestseller Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump, Fox News contributor Bongino exposes who masterminded the dangerous playbook to take down Trump, their motives, and how a plan filled with faked allegations backfired\u2014forcing investigators to up the ante and hide their missteps and half-truths in a desperate effort to prove a collusion case that never happened. The result? The misguided multimillion Mueller investigation that tore the nation apart, tried to destabilize the presidency and led, as the world now knows, to nowhere.",

On Tuesday, Kutcher, who is married to Mila Kunis, tweeted a phone number claiming followers could text it for \u201ctruth.\u201d Upon messaging the number and following a link, Page Six reports that a pre-written text is sent in response. In it, the actor voices his opinion on Trump\u2019s scandal involving his July call with Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky. DEMI MOORE SAYS ASHTON KUTCHER HOSTED A PARTY WITH JENNA AND BARBARA BUSH, DID 'BONG HITS' \u201cMila and I met with President Zelenski (sic) and his wife a little over a week ago. My gut: He is committed to eliminating corruption in Ukraine. He\u2019s also committed to ending the war and grateful for the US financial commitment because they need it,\u201d the response says. Kunis was born in Ukraine and lived there when she was a child. \u201cIf our president used that financial aid to leverage president Zelensky to investigate Biden should be impeached. If our president did not use it as leverage and simply encouraged president Zelensky to investigate Biden without cause he should be impeached,\u201d a follow-up text reads. DEMI MOORE\u2019S SPLIT FROM ASHTON KUTCHER WAS 'A NIGHTMARE' AND 'TOOK HER YEARS TO GET OVER': REPORT A third and final text says: \u201cIf you like President Trump or not America is the priority soliciting foreign interference in our election in unAmerican.\u201d Many were quick to believe that Kutcher\u2019s initial tweet was his way of addressing explosive claims made by Moore in her memoir \u201cInside Out.\u201d In it, she accuses him of infidelity, pressuring her into threesomes and encouraging her to break her sobriety. FREDDY MOORE'S WIFE TALKS DEMI MOORE\u2019S SHOCKING CHEATING CLAIM, SAYS MUSICIAN IS BATTLING ALZHEIMER'S An hour prior to sharing the phone number, \u201cThe Ranch\u201d actor shared two more cryptic tweets that seemed to hint at the Moore drama. \u201cI was about to push the button on a really snarky tweet.

      "content": " It would be understandable if President Trump wakes up troubled these days by four words bouncing around his head: \"Loose lips sink ships.\" Understandable \u2014 and advisable. The World War II warning against careless talk carries a personal meaning for the beleaguered president. \u00adBeset by a hostile media and a ruthless opposition party, Trump now must be careful about every word he says, privately and publicly. The walls, including those in the White House, have ears. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That was demonstrated in spades last week, most dramatically by the allegations from a CIA officerthat Trump used a phone call with the president of Ukraine to solicit foreign help in the 2020 campaign. That allegation and others led to a fiery congressional hearing and spurred Democrats to quicken their pace toward impeachment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER A second instance of snooping made the \u201cloose lips\u201d point less sensationally but was still disturbing. Before he left the United Nations Thursday, Trump attended a private event to thank the new American ambassador, Kelly Craft, and her staff for their work during the General \u00adAssembly session. Some privacy. The president said, \u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because\u00a0that\u2019s close to a spy.\u201d We know he said that and more \u00adbecause someone at the event, maybe more than one person, secretly \u00adrecorded his remarks, both audio and video, and promptly leaked them to the media. When it comes to brickbats, Trump is perhaps the most battle-tested occupant the Oval Office has ever known, yet the two incidents demonstrate that the war against him has entered a vicious new phase. Efforts to end his presidency, one way or another, have reached a fever pitch, and Trump would be foolish to assume they will fail. His margin for error is approximately zero.

      "content": "A Reddit forum for self-described supporters of President Trump was \u201cquarantined\u201d on Wednesday over threats against police and public officials in Oregon,\u00a0the tech giant said. Reddit officials said the moderators on the subreddit \u201cr/The_Donald\u201d \u2014 which counts about 750,000 followers \u2014 had encouraged or allowed behavior that broke the site\u2019s violence policy. \u201cWe are sensitive to what could be considered political speech,\u201d said Reddit spokeswoman Anna Soellner. \u201cHowever, recent behaviors including threats against the police and public figures is content that is prohibited by our violence policy. As a result, we have sanctioned individual users and quarantined the subreddit.\u201d Some users on the message board \u2014 which bills itself as \u201ca never-ending rally dedicated to the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump\u201d \u2014 had allegedly encouraged violence related to Oregon\u2019s recent climate change vote. GOP state senators\u00a0fled to prevent the bill from passing, and after calls for state police to go bring the lawmakers back, local far-right militias said they were prepared to defend the senators. \u201cr/The_Donald\u201d members posted since-deleted comments like \u201cnone of this gets fixed without people picking up rifles,\u201d and \u201c[I have] no problems shooting a cop trying to strip rights from Citizens,\u201d\u00a0according to The Verge. The quarantine won\u2019t completely ban the forum, but it will conceal the community behind a warning where viewers have to affirm that they are sure they want to view the content. The message board will also be blocked from appearing in searches or recommendations. In a letter sent to the moderators, Reddit said it had observed a \u201cdisproportionate amount of rule-breaking behavior.\u201d \u201cWe recognize that you do remove posts that are reported, but we are troubled that violent content more often goes unreported, and worse, is upvoted,\u201d the note said. The quarantine will be reevaluated if moderators \u201cunambiguously communicate to your subscribers that violent content is unacceptable,\u201d Reddit said. \u201cWe are aware of Reddit\u2019s decision and are monitoring what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Trump reelection campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh.\u00a0 \u201cWe remain concerned about practices of various social media platforms and their efforts to silence conservative voices and supporters of President Trump.\u00a0 It is an ongoing problem of fairness and infringement of freedom of speech.\u201d Additional reporting by Nikki Schwab This story originally appeared in the New York Post.",

      "content": " The evidence that has emerged in\u00a0the past two weeks\u00a0alone\u00a0makes it clear to me that Donald Trump has\u00a0sought assistance from a foreign government for his 2020 campaign.\u00a0Trump\u2019s decision to seek\u00a0that\u00a0assistance has put him in peril of losing the office he is desperate to keep. It\u2019s\u00a0also\u00a0clear to me it\u2019s not the first time. It\u2019s the third time \u2026 at least. You can draw a straight line from Trump standing on a stage in Miami on July 27, 2016, when he said \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,\" pleading with Russia to locate Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails to last Thursday on the White House lawn pleading with China to investigate the Biden\u2019s. \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d said Trump. ANDREW MCCARTHY: IF THE HOUSE WON'T VOTE, IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS JUST A DEMOCRATIC STUNT In plain sight, and in my opinion, Trump is asking foreign governments for help in his elections. That is illegal. Just as his request of Ukraine to investigate Biden is illegal. As I wrote last week, and repeatedly stated, it is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER That one request, without anything else, is enough to seek impeachment. However, it appears these three examples may not be the only occasions Trump asked a foreign government for election assistance. Now, it is reported that Trump raised Biden in a call with President Xi of China on June 18 as well \u2026 a full three months before his appearance on the White House lawn last week. A record of that call was also stored in the highly secured electronic system with the one to Ukraine's President Zelensky that led to a whistleblower complaint and the impeachment inquiry into Trump. And like the call to Zelensky, the White House did not deny that Trump discussed Biden and the 2020 campaign in his call to Xi. In fact, China acknowledged it just as Trump and Ukraine confirmed their call too. Did Trump ask China for help with Biden in that conversation? Unless Trump releases the full transcript of the call we may not know\u00a0what happened. But, we are about to learn much more about foreign assistance provided to Trump in the 2016 election, and what he may have known about it during the Roger Stone WikiLeaks trial scheduled to begin on Nov.\u00a05\u00a0in the midst of the Impeachment Inquiry. Stone, a longtime political adviser to Trump, was indicted on seven counts of obstruction, lying to Congress, and witness tampering as a result of Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Specifically, the focus of this trial is whether Stone coordinated with WikiLeaks/Julian Assange, who\u00a0published approximately 55,000 emails prosecutors say were hacked by Russian operatives from the Democratic National Committee to harm the Clinton campaign. It is alleged that Stone was in frequent contact with at least four members of Trump\u2019s campaign about the WikiLeaks effort to release the emails before the 2016 election. Not only will we learn about the role Stone, Assange\u00a0and WikiLeaks played in interfering with our 2016 election, we may also learn that Trump knew about their efforts despite his repeated denials for the past three years. Currently, the section of the Mueller Report about \"contacts with the (Trump) campaign about WikiLeaks\" is largely redacted because if it is made public then it could harm an ongoing matter. That ongoing matter is the Stone WikiLeaks trial. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee submitted a court filing seeking secret grand jury testimony from the Mueller Report for the impeachment inquiry.\u00a0In it they cited a footnote in the Mueller Report about Paul Manafort speaking to Trump after WikiLeaks released the hacked documents in July 2016 that implies Trump knew about Russia\u2019s involvement. The Mueller Report recounts a conversation between Trump and Rick Gates, his deputy campaign chairman who has been cooperating with federal authorities, where \"Trump told Gates that more releases of damaging information would be coming\". Manafort \"recalled that Trump responded that Manafort should (REDACTED: Harm to Ongoing Matter) keep Trump updated,\" after discussing the WikiLeaks release of the hacked Democratic National Committee files during the DNC Convention in July 2016. While the House Judiciary Committee may not succeed in getting the secret grand jury testimony it is very likely that the information in the now redacted section of the Mueller Report is revealed during the trial. When this material is revealed it is also likely to show that Trump lied about his knowledge regarding Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, including in his written responses to Mueller\u2019s questions about it. If that is true then it is a stunning development that further fuels the impeachment inquiry as it casts even more doubt about Trump\u2019s actions in the 2016 and 2020 elections, inviting even more scrutiny, that could bring more articles of impeachment, and charges when Trump leaves the White House. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM Every time there is a request for foreign help in Trump\u2019s campaigns all roads lead to Donald Trump. So far that has happened at least three times,\u00a0Russia, Ukraine, and China. Each request is illegal.\u00a0And it is possible there may be even more. That\u2019s why Trump is facing\u00a0the possibility of\u00a0impeachment. And when all the facts are known\u00a0I believe\u00a0Trump could face\u00a0a fate\u00a0much worse than impeachment too.

      "content": "This is a rush transcript from \"Media Buzz,\" March 31, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. HOWARD KURTZ, HOST: On \"Buzz Media\" this morning, the president's son speaks out on his battle with the media during the Russia investigation. The personal toll, why he thinks the coverage is biased, whether he and his dad go too far on Twitter, and his father's enemy of the people rhetoric against the press. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, JR., SON OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They did a terrible disservice to this country, to journalism as a profession. I think they've done irreparable damage to the faith that the average American is going to have in terms of mainstream journalism. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: A wide-ranging conversation on media, politics, and culture with Donald Trump, Jr. The mainstream media's leaders mount a counterattack against fierce criticism including from the president that their coverage of the Mueller probe has been overdone, overhyped, and overwrought. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) CARL BERNSTEIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: This is the greatest journalistic challenge of the modern era, to report on a malignant presidency. What we are watching in the Trump presidency is worse than Watergate. CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: The president of the United States has been lying to the American people for years now, lying that he was ever doing any business with a foreign power which was, at the same time, committing criminal acts to help get him elected president. JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: This is the first time since Watergate and perhaps even before Watergate that we have had a president of the United States while in office implicated in committing crimes. RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I am outraged by the behavior of these networks. CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: OK. GIULIANI: Collusion, collusion. Collusion, collusion. Collusion, collusion. No collusion. CUOMO: OK, here's my -- here's my case -- GIULIANI: No collusion. CUOMO: Here's my case. GIULIANI: Apologize. CUOMO: Never. JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: Don't knock reporters at The New York Times or The Washington Post or The Wall Street Journal or the broadcast networks for doing their job right. (END VIDEO CLIPS) KURTZ: Is the press, after two years of investigations, tone deaf to these complaints? A former Democratic candidate who says Joe Biden made her cringe with an unwanted kiss takes to the airwaves this morning. Are the media now giving the former VP presidential-level scrutiny? Plus, Jussie Smollett, who fooled much of the media with his hate crime hoax, gets off scot-free. Why the president is calling that a miscarriage of justice. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" Donald Trump Jr. has become a highly charged political presence in his own right. Controversial, he really mixes it up on Twitter, a fierce defender of his father, naturally, and until Robert Mueller ended his investigation, a constant target of media scrutiny and speculation in the Russia probe. I sat down with the president's eldest son in New York. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KURTZ: Donald Trump, Jr., welcome. TRUMP: Good to be with you, Howard. KURTZ: With Robert Mueller bringing no further charges, this question: How did it feel to hear yourself constantly described in the media as being in deep trouble and possibly facing indictment? TRUMP: Listen, it was less than fun. I mean, I guess the reality is I knew what had happened because I was actually there. While I may have been the catalyst for this, I also realized that this was a lot of nonsense that was just sort of perpetrated by the Democrats and by the media and sort of pushed mostly because they wanted it to be true. That said -- KURTZ: But there was an investigation. TRUMP: There was. And without question, when you see sort of the gamesmanship that has been played over these last three years and, you know, the ambiguity as to how it all started and why, you certainly have to wonder. There was an element of, you know, relief from that because as a pretty tried and true American, you don't want to hear those kinds of things, you know? Your father is a Russian agent. You know, I'm going to jail for treason. I mean, it was all nonsense and sound bites, but you don't want to hear it and it's been, you know, a pretty disgusting road. KURTZ: I can see where it would take a toll. You say the media along with the Democrats are collusion truthers, pushing sick and twisted conspiracy theories. I don't necessarily agree with that language, but isn't that a pretty broad brush? Every reporter, every commentator, every major news outlet, nobody tried to be fair? TRUMP: I think there were some people that tried to actually be fair. When they were actually fair, you'd see the other side just try to just obliterate them, right, even their own following. So, you know, I think there were a couple people who did good reporting, and I don't mean, you know, conservative reporters. I mean actually people on the other side. They were at least unbiased or tried to look at it objectively -- KURTZ: You're saying it was dangerous for them to try to be -- TRUMP: Oh, they lost their followings, they get ratioed to heck, you know, it became a business model for most media to attack Donald Trump and to buy into this narrative. And if you didn't, you upset a lot of people and risked your career, you risked other things. And so, you know, the people who just bought into this hook, line, and sinker, who were selling it day in and day out, every day, this must be the truth, we've seen the evidence, we've -- they lied to the American public for two years, Howie. There is no ramification, there is no nothing. But they did a major disservice to the people who did do a good job, small group of people who were, you know, reasonably objective and did a good job. And more importantly, they did a terrible disservice to this country, to journalism as a profession. I think they've done irreparable damage to the faith that the average American is going to have in terms of main stream journalism. I think it is a blight on our republic, on democracy, and on our constitution that's not going to come undone very quickly. KURTZ: You said recently Bob Mueller was using an old Stalinist tactic, you show me the man, I'll show you the crime. Now that he's closing up shop, isn't bringing any further criminal charges, do you want to revise that assessment? \u00a0TRUMP: Listen, my statement stand as to how all of this started. I mean, you know, this was a witch hunt to end all witch hunts. KURTZ: I've heard that phrase before. \u00a0TRUMP: Heard it once or twice but -- KURTZ: Yeah. As far as how Mueller conducted himself. TRUMP: You have 19 lawyers, all of them happened to be Hillary Clinton donors -- come on. You know, I think they could have done a much better job putting those teams together. They could have gotten rid of some of the flagrant bias that just screams to you when you look at the way this stuff was set up. The result is fine. KURTZ: But in the end, was it fair? \u00a0TRUMP: I think so because they didn't find anything, but the reality is there was nothing there to find. Now, I don't believe for one second that there's not one person on that team whose dream it would not have been to take down Donald Trump. I stand by that 100 percent. And I think anyone who's a conservative who's seen it and anyone who's an independent and objective probably believes that. KURTZ: As far as Donald Trump, Jr., with the benefit of hindsight, are there things you would have done differently, for example, taking the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with the Russian lawyer? TRUMP: You know, you had a Russian lawyer who was trying a case earlier that day downtown in New York City. I'm in business. You take a hundred meetings for something that happened. You listen. You want all the information. So, I don't. But what's frustrating to me though is that that was the basis of two, three years of investigations, nonstop this, traitor, all of the sound bites that you've heard. But the fact that that person was meeting with Fusion GPS before and after that meeting, that Hillary Clinton and the DNC were paying Fusion GPS for this information, that they paid foreign agents in foreign countries, that's no problem. That merits no investigation whatsoever -- KURTZ: Once that meeting was revealed by The New York Times, could you all have done a better job of getting the facts out? TRUMP: The reality is this, I mean, people say, oh, we lied -- we didn't lie about it. They asked what the meeting was about. We have no obligation to tell The New York Times in a kill piece more than we want to say. But the reason they knew about it is this, we handed these e-mails over. It wasn't that The New York Times magically discovered this. We handed it over and someone leaked it. But we were being open and honest, as we have been. You don't think for one second that the, you know, the tinfoil hat brigade, Adam Schiff, spent seven or eight hours testifying. You don't think that he gave my testimony. Those seven or eight hours of the 27 hours, you know, on a 20-minute meeting, 27 hours. You don't think that those guys were giving all of that to Mueller to make sure let's see if he lied somewhere? We were open and honest about this from moment one. KURTZ: You mentioned Adam Schiff, the House Intel chairman, you also called him slimy, but should we get to a point now the investigation is over where the White House and Congress, where Democrats and Republicans could work together and do some things for the country and wouldn't that require taking a little bit of the -- TRUMP: I said that the other night on Tucker, actually. I'd love to see Republicans and Democrats get together. How about we work on infrastructure? Because the reality is this, look at the numbers, Howie. Look at unemployment rates, look at your 401 K, look at the stock market, look at rising wages, you know, again, all-time low African-American unemployment, all-time low Hispanic unemployment, all-time low female unemployment. My father's record is impeccable. KURTZ: You're talking about your father's record. Now, top aides and advisers to him have told me on many occasions that they think sometimes he steps on his own message, distracts from his own agenda with the Twitter attacks and the insults. You ever had that conversation with him? (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: This is a no-win answer, Howie. KURTZ: I think I've struck gold. \u00a0TRUMP: Listen, I think there are times when that certainly happen. I mean, I'm guilty of it myself. You know, I think the reality -- he's a counterpuncher. KURTZ: Yeah. TRUMP: But the thing is this. If we lived in a fair world where fine it was 50 percent, you know, left and right and people were trying to be objective, it'd be one thing. But we live in a world where 93 percent negative coverage, of what? Of the record I just described? Of all-time low unemployment numbers, of bringing jobs back to America -- KURTZ: That's on a number of networks, yeah. \u00a0TRUMP: It's 93 percent negative on a winning record of getting things done and accomplishing things. So you have to hit back. He's got an incredible platform. He's created that for himself. I always say he plays monkey in the middle with the press because if you leave it to them, they're only going to report their narrative. KURTZ: OK, but right after we learned no further indictments, nothing on collusion, Mueller didn't make any recommendation of obstruction, president tweeted that the MSM is corrupt and the enemy of the people, I always object to that particular language, enemy of the people, but so he's still on offense. Does that mean he's going to continue to run against journalism? \u00a0TRUMP: I don't know that he's running against journalism, he's running against fake news. KURTZ: He says all of mainstream media. \u00a0TRUMP: But they're not even -- most are still not reporting this quite that way. They're looking for the loophole. They're looking for the disk (ph). They report, well, Bill Barr did this on the obstruction piece. No, no, Bill Barr and Rod Rosenstein who is not exactly a Trump fan, OK? I don't think anyone -- KURTZ: He's a Republican. He was appointed by the president. \u00a0TRUMP: I don't think anyone actually believes that, OK? They leave those parts out. The mainstream media has been their own worst enemy in all of this because they can't help but push the narrative that they want. Rather than the narrative -- KURTZ: What I'm saying is if the president continues through November of 2020 to talk about the Mueller investigation, how he feels was a witch hunt, he feels that he was mistreated, you know, then that also drives the coverage. Do you want to keep talking -- does your side want to keep talking about this? \u00a0TRUMP: I think you do have to talk about -- I mean, you know, I think people heard about the deep state for decades. They read about it maybe a little bit. I don't think they ever gave it all that much credence. But when you look at what is going on in the last two years, you know, that's a big part of it. And, again, I do believe that a lot in the media -- not all, but a lot, the vast majority, the biggest names are totally complicit in this and in pushing that message. You can see, Howie, I've never as an American experienced a time where I would have thought that the Democrats would be visibly upset that the president of the United States did not actually collude with the Russians. KURTZ: Right. TRUMP: I mean -- KURTZ: Partisanship aside, that's a big favor to the country. TRUMP: That a kind of a winning thing, right? Oh, it didn't happen. You would think they'd be happy about it. They're not. They wanted it to be true. That's what's scary. KURTZ: Let me ask you about an NPR story about you late last year, I'm sure you remember this, NPR reporting that Michael Cohen's testimony about Russian Trump Tower project raised questions about your truthfulness in congressional testimony. Turns out the wrong project, you actually had talked about the other Cohen-related project, discussed throughout 2016, NPR retracted the story, said it had moved too quickly. TRUMP: Correct. They were one of the few that did a good job of that. They actually retracted it because there were two different things, and if they read paragraph further in my testimony, they would have realized it. But that's the problem. They saw, oh, here it is, hit it. Hit send. We've got to attack. If they would have taken fife seconds longer, they would have realized it was very clear and on the same page that they were referring to that it was two different things. Hey, there are other institutions that didn't do that. CNN did the thing where Michael Cohen testified that Donald Trump Jr. told his father about the meeting -- KURTZ: In advance, the Trump Tower meeting in advance. TRUMP: Right. And Lanny Davis was the source, Michael Cohen's attorney. Lanny Davis -- KURTZ: That's somewhat in dispute, according to Lanny. TRUMP: Lanny Davis then retracted it, said it wasn't true. KURTZ: He didn't know whether it was true. TRUMP: No, no, he said it wasn't true. KURTZ: Now Cohen testified and he did not say that. TRUMP: Correct. They don't even make the adjustment afterward. So they know it's false. They have people on both sides saying it's false, and they just leave it out there as gospel because it was the narrative they wanted as opposed to what actually took place. (END VIDEOTAPE) KURTZ: More of my interview with the president's son right after this as we get into his battles on Twitter and his dad's testy relationship with The New York Times. And later, the media is starting to scrutinize Joe Biden as the former Democratic candidate publishes a piece on how uncomfortable he made her feel with a kiss on the hand. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KURTZ: More now of my conversation with Donald Trump, Jr. in New York. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KURTZ: I often say that your father has a love-hate relationship with the press, not that much love lately. So, for example -- TRUMP: You can understand that, I think. KURTZ: \u00a0OK. TRUMP: If you took the incoming that he took -- KURTZ: He's always railing against the failing New York Times and yet he continues to give the paper interviews, he has invited the publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, to dinner, he talks to Maggie Haberman. Does he want the paper's approval even as he criticizes The New York Times? TRUMP: Listen, I think the reality is he's going to criticize people when he believes he is being mistreated, but he's going to give them the opportunity to try to make it right. I think in this case perhaps he's given many them too many opportunities to try to make it right. KURTZ: You're a bit of a brawler. I suggest it may run in the family. Why do you dive into the sort of these other controversies? For example, when Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman were charged in that college admissions payoff scam, you're on Twitter saying, hey, why is everyone in Hollywood so silent? TRUMP: Because they seem to have an opinion about everything that relates to us. It's always nice to -- again, I've got a little bit of the counterpunching gene. I think it probably took politics for me to realize that I was a little bit more like my father than I perhaps ever thought before this. Again, it's more about rallying against a lot of the hypocrisy that's out there. Everyone has an opinion on this. The second something happens on that side, it's not news, it's not this, it's covered up. I mean, I think - - KURTZ: Do you sometimes say in tweets and say, maybe I should have let that one go? TRUMP: I don't know that I've ever regretted sending one. I've regretted perhaps the response to it. You know, but again I think, you know, there's what you intend to say and the message and then there's the way it's sort of contorted and twisted and turned. I mean, you put something in writing and, you know, certainly I've seen it in interviews, and I've seen this with my father a lot. He'll be at a speech. Donald Trump said this. And I said, really? When? Yesterday! Where? In Pennsylvania. But I was there with him yesterday in Pennsylvania. He didn't say that. Well, no, but if you take minute number one and minute number 15 and minute number 43 of a speech and you combine it into one thought even though it wasn't, he said it. I'm like, there's just sort of a lot of dishonesty in terms of the way what is there. I mean, the best is when you see him when he's clearly -- he's got a sense of humor. KURTZ: Yes. TRUMP: When you see him have a sense of humor and, oh, my god, he literally asked the Russians to -- like, really? Like they make it seem like he did that in some sort of private meeting as opposed to in front of 27,000 people on live television. It's a joke and you can't pretend that it's not. Because again, that is another place where the media does themselves a great disservice because any reasonable individual watching knows that he's just having a good time. KURTZ: You grew up in business here in New York. Did you -- now you're very much in the political arena. Did you ever envision that kind of life for yourself before November of 2016? \u00a0TRUMP: Not really. It was really before we announced, June 16, 2015, I probably never envisioned it. And I sort of figured on November 9th that I'd get back to work. I had a lot of e-mails that day, congratulations, buddy, we were with you all along. I'm like, I don't think so. It's funny, I haven't heard from you in two years, but now you're with us. That's when you realize how crazy some of this thing is but that is also sort of when the attacks started coming and, you know, the reality is I'm a fighter, I'm willing to fight -- KURTZ: Did you enlist or you drafted? \u00a0TRUMP: I enlisted. KURTZ: Don, thanks very much for sitting down with us. TRUMP: Thanks, Howie. (END VIDEOTAPE) KURTZ: When we come back, Michael Avenatti facing criminal charges in two cases. Why did some news outlets build up the (INAUDIBLE) lawyer in the first place? And later, major media leaders are fighting back against an onslaught of criticism over their Mueller coverage. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KURTZ: When Michael Avenatti now facing criminal charges on both coasts first burst on to our television screams, he was this lawyer pushing Stormy Daniels' case against the president. But he seemed to love the cameras more than the porn star did and the attraction was mutual. In the space of two months, CNN and MSNBC put him on the air more than 100 times, sometimes several times a day, as he spouted his anti-Trump message and sometimes hurled unsubstantiated charges. These two networks helped turn Avenatti into a folk hero. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL AVENATTI, ATTORNEY: There have been some criticisms about how our media strategy and how often I'm on CNN and how often I've been on your show and other networks, et cetera, OK? It's all a bunch of nonsense. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: The fame-hungry attorney soon convinced himself he should run for the Democratic presidential nomination, and some anchors and hosts encouraged that delusion. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DON LEMON, CNN HOST: Someone said to me, do you think it would be odd if you were all of a sudden in a few years, do you think you'll be saying, you know, I used to interview that guy as Stormy Daniels's attorney, and now he's the president of the United States? KASIE HUNT, NBC NEWS CAPITOL HILL CORRESPONDENT: There are lot of people who want to run for the Democratic nomination in 2020. How do you think your potential competitors stack up when it comes to taking on the president? AVENATTI: I've been traveling around the country raising money for Democrats, and I've received an incredible response in every state that I've gone to. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: During the Brett Kavanaugh hearings when Avenatti represented the third accuser, Julie Swetnick, he made outlandish allegations and never came close to being substantiated and still got a platform. Now, Avenatti is in the news for a very different reason. He was arrested in one case for allegedly embezzling big bucks from a client and in another for trying to extort $20 million from Nike. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A suit and tie doesn't mask the fact that, at its core, this was an old-fashioned shakedown. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: So Avenatti, who says he was exposing wrongdoing at Nike, showed up in a TV studio. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AVENATTI: I am nervous, I'm concerned, I'm scared. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But you also seemed confident. \u00a0AVENATTI: I am confident because I believe the facts are on my side. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: Now, even Stormy Daniels says Avenatti was extremely dishonest with her. Let's face it. The media were complicit in building up Michael Avenatti because they couldn't resist the combination of his anti-Trump fervor and his showing pictures of his porn star client. We showed the pictures. Ahead, the media outrage as charges are dropped against Jussie Smollett. Why did many in the press buy his horrible hoax in the first place? But up next, two liberal pundits say they're been banned by CNN and MSNBC for defending President Trump during the Russia probe. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KURTZ: Facing stinging criticism about their coverage of the Mueller investigation, some top media executives are pushing back including in a New York Times interview CNN President Jeff Zucker. We are not investigators, we are journalists. And our role is to report the facts as we know them, which is exactly what we did. Washington Post Editor Martin Baron, our job is to bring facts to light. Others make determinations about prosecutable criminal offenses. And the New York Times Editor Dean Baquet, we heard a lot about Russia. And I have no regrets. It's not our job to determine whether there was illegality. Meanwhile, two liberal commentators, Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept, and Harvard law professor, Alan Dershowitz, say they were booted aft other cable news channels for defending Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GLENN GREENWALD, THE INTERCEPT: It was continuously on MSNBC, which let me just say, should have their top host on primetime go before the cameras and hang their head in shame and apologize for lying to people for three straight years, exploiting their fears to great profit. ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR: It's time for CNN to issue an apology. CNN banned me from their air because I was being too fair. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Emily Jashinsky, culture editor at The Federalist, and Clarence Page, columnist for the Chicago Tribune. So Alan Dershowitz, who voted for Hillary, wrote in The Hill that he was told Jeff Zucker ordered him not to be booked for six months. He says CNN's profits started to grow once it was seen as an anti-Trump network. The brass didn't want their viewers' minds to be confused by the law or the facts. Strong charge. EMILY JASHINSKY, THE FEDERALIST: Well, the notion that CNN was trafficking purely in facts over the last two years is absolutely laughable. They had a narrative to push. And same was true of MSNBC. And so, either of Glenn Greenwald or Alan Dershowitz would have absolutely disrupted that narrative. And there was very little disruptions as someone who watched all of the networks on both of those airwaves of the narrative. It was all narrative, narrative, narrative, driven purely for two years. And they had very few people willing to disrupt it. And that explains why they didn't have Dershowitz or Greenwald. KURTZ: It's also true that Dershowitz got a lot more invitations from Fox News when he started defending Trump in this case. Look, the Mueller probe, Clarence, sealed 37 indictments. But given the thousands of segments, thousands of stories, millions of online posts about Russian collusion and obstruction, which now there'll be no more challenges, shouldn't these organizations or journalists do a little bit of soul searching about whether they went too far with the non- stop coverage? CLARENCE PAGE, CHICAGO TRIBUNE: I don't think our souls need to be searched. It's what you look at in order to determine, if you're being ethical, if you have been moral, if you're being balanced and fair... KURTZ: Do you believe the coverage was balanced and fair for two years? PAGE: There's a difference between news coverage and opinion analysis. And that's what has been mixed up, unfortunately, in our media in this era. A lot of folks look at a commentator or anchor like we have in primetime on cable these days and say, well, he's not being objective. No, he's a commentator. He's -- you know, whether you're talking about Sean Hannity or talking about Rachel Maddow, or others who mix up their analysis with their reporting. KURTZ: But even in daytime news coverage or newspapers, news stories, forget about op-eds, forget about commentaries, it seems everyone's saying, well, no regrets, we did everything right. JASHINSKY: Yeah. KURTZ: That's not how much of the country sees it. JASHINSKY: No regrets, we're not investigators. It's not our job to determine illegality. And actually, when you look at this, Brian Shelter himself of CNN came out and said speculation has its place in the news media. And what CNN was doing was with speculating for two years. And even some of the reporting, it wasn't based on fact. They had to retract several stories over the past two years, because what they wanted to be true is what they were pushing. It was difference between just the pure truth and what they wanted to be true. And that's why we saw all this narrative be pushed across their network for two years, basically. KURTZ: Now, the president is demanding... PAGE: There was smoke out there, though. There was a lot of smoke. And you've got to follow that smoke. And who knows where the fire is. We haven't even opened up the Mueller report yet. JASHINSKY: Yes. PAGE: We've only looked at a cover letter about the Mueller report. KURTZ: We haven't seen the report. Nobody is saying there shouldn't have been covered, and covered intensively. I'm talking about the nonstop nature of it, the overwhelmingly negative tone. And, by the way, the president demanding that the New York Times and Washington Post return Pulitzer Prizes they received for this coverage. The fact that nobody -- the fact that there are no further indictments doesn't mean the stories were inaccurate, but there were a lot of high profile blunders made. Meanwhile, Emily, let me play something that the president said at the rally in Grand Rapids the other night, going off on the media and the ratings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The crooked journalists, the totally dishonest TV pundits -- and, by the way, they know it's not true. They just got great ratings. By the way, their ratings dropped through the floor last night, did you see that? (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: The president went on to say that the ratings surge for our friends, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson. So he's boasting on Twitter that the ratings for CNN, MSNBC, Morning Joe all went down. Maybe that was true for a few days. Joe Scarborough comes back and says, well, our ratings are in an all-time high. And Mr. President, you're 34 percent in New Hampshire. Does Trump measure everything -- the success of everything he does by ratings? JASHINSKY: Absolutely. And I think, you know, his background speaks to that. He comes from the television world. He loves media attention. And so, of course, yeah, that's absolutely true. But the ratings -- CNN's ratings were up over the course. And when we're looking at motivations for pushing this narrative, it's because they did see an uptick in ratings when they started to focus on Russian collusion. And the same is true about MSNBC. Rachel Maddow's show ratings were up big time. And she covered this every night. And you know she covered it in dramatic fashion every night. KURTZ: So the president... PAGE: We don't want to be dull in our business. KURTZ: That is true. JASHINSKY: Yes, yes. KURTZ: The president tweeting about the fake news media going crazy, suffering a major breakdown, zero credibility. So I asked this question to Donald Trump, Jr. Is he going to keep talking about Mueller and keep talking about the president until Election Day? PAGE: Who? KURTZ: Is the President of the United States going to keep making... PAGE: Trump isn't talking about Mueller, he's talking about us, the media, you know. I wish he would talk about Mueller. If he had talked more about the Russia collusion charge early on, we wouldn't have had all these suspicions. The fact is when you gather what facts you've got and then you start to draw some conclusions, when you start speculating excessively, you're absolutely right, there was too much of that mixed up with news coverage, however... KURTZ: Let me... PAGE: Returning Pulitzer Prizes, that's grandstanding. KURTZ: OK. PAGE: He will go on to those Pulitzer prizes. They're still true. KURTZ: Now, just breaking more this morning, Lucy Flores, she was the Democratic nominee in Nevada for lieutenant governor, has written a chilling piece in the New York Magazine about how Joe Biden -- who came to campaign for her, I'll let her tell the story. The point is she's out there saying how uncomfortable the former vice-president made her. Here she is on CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LUCY FLORES, DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I feel Joe Biden put his hands on my shoulders, gets up very close to me from behind, lean in, smell my hair. And then plant a slow kiss on the top of my head. It was just shocking. It was shocking because you don't expect that kind of intimate behavior. You don't expect that kind of intimacy from someone so powerful. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: Emily, is the press starting to give Joe Biden presidential-level scrutiny, even though he hasn't officially jumped in to the race? JASHINSKY: Yeah. I think he's polling at the top of the list right now. And so, it is warranted to an extent. I think it's potential, but there are some enemies of Joe Biden, some allies of the other candidates in this race that are leaking this information, or pushing this narrative. KURTZ: But in the case of Lucy Flores, she says she is not doing it to support any candidate, she felt compelled to speak out. In fact, here's another quote from that State of the Union interview. The reason why I felt compelled to finally say something because it was five years ago, was over the years, this behavior was documented, as it was, frankly, dismissed by the media and not taken seriously. JASHINSKY: Right. I think she absolutely has a good point about that. If Joe Biden, for instance -- and I don't want hike to play this game, but if Joe Biden were a conservative, he would not have gotten away with this. He would not have gotten a pass from the media for years and years, because this is evidence of him behaving like this, photographic evidence going back years. KURTZ: Clarence, Biden put out a statement this morning saying, I have offered handshakes, hugs, expression of affections over the years. Not once, never, did believe I acted -- did I act inappropriately. But someone suggests I did. So I will listen respectfully, but it was never my intention. Could all of this negative attention affect his decision to run? PAGE: It certainly already has, I'm sure. Remember, Howie, we would not be talking about this in these terms right now, if it hadn't been for Al Franken being forced to resign for similar charges. And then there was Kristin Gillibrand -- listen, I think it was a backlash against Democrats, why are you wiping and purging our wonderful candidate? The same thing is happening now in the party about Biden. Biden knows this. He knew it for a while. So I don't think that'll stop him. KURTZ: Yeah. I think Biden had figured some of this would come out, but the media at least doing their jobs. All right, panel stay put. After the break, Ben Shapiro and the president taking some over Obamacare. And how economists smeared Ben Shapiro as an alt-right guy. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Let me just tell you exactly what my message is. The Republican Party will soon be known as the Party of Healthcare. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: President Trump drawing plenty of media criticism for moving yet again to abolish Obamacare with journalists arguing and quoting unnamed Republicans as saying that he has no healthcare plan after three failed attempts to repeal and replace the program that he and his party ran against. I spoke earlier from LA with Ben Shapiro, editor-in-chief of the Daily Wire, syndicated radio host, and author of the new number one New York Times bestseller, The Right Side of History: How Reason And Moral Purpose Made The West Great. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: Ben Shapiro, welcome. BEN SHAPIRO, DAILY WIRE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: Thanks so much for having me. KURTZ: The pundits are nearly unanimous in saying that President Trump, it's bad politics for him to again bring up getting rid of Obamacare. He was riding high after the Mueller report are, after three failed attempts to get it repealed through the Republican congress. Are the pundits wrong? SHAPIRO: No, I actually don't think they are. I think that the president suggesting there's a plan in the wings is, obviously, not the case. I've spoken to legislators in the Senate and the House. There's no plan that is forthcoming. The only thing that might be true is that President Trump is planning, essentially, for the Supreme Court to uphold his former statements on Obamacare, uphold Obamacare. And then he can blame the Democrats in Congress for blocking any sort of reform of Obamacare, make them own the status quo as well as the possibility of Medicare For All. That could be a clever political strategy. KURTZ: Right. But he is, of course, backing a lawsuit that would get rid of Obamacare, pre-existing conditions and all, without any plan in place, as you just noted. SHAPIRO: Right. And that, again, maybe his lawyers betting that the Supreme Court, which still has the same constituency, John Roberts in the swing vote position will vote the same way they did before. And Trump can say, listen, I did the best that we I could to get rid of Obamacare. I even sided with a lawsuit to get rid of Obamacare. The Supreme Court won't let me do it. That's actually not a terrible argument to the base. KURTZ: All right. Blame it on John Roberts. In a review of your book, The Economist called you the pop idol to the alt-right, catering to hyperventilating conservatives. The other day, the British magazine retracted that description and apologized. What happened? SHAPIRO: Well, I mean, I think a lot of people who don't know what the alt- right is, I'll attribute to arrogance rather than malice and ignorance. A bunch of folks on the left seem to think everybody who's conservative is quote and unquote, alt-right. The alt-right actually has an ideology. It is a white supremacist ideology that suggests that western civilization is predicated not on eternal immutable principles, but is based solely on race. And western civilization is just about white people. Oddly enough, there are folks on the left who seem to think the same thing. But the alt-right believes what makes western civilization great is that it is a civilization about white people. That obviously is false, it is also stupid. I've been a long-time critic of the alt-right. I was the number one recipient of their hate in 2016. I sought higher security. Thanks to the hatred from the alt-right. So The Economist labeling me some sort of pop icon of the alt-right was obviously wrong on its face. And that's why The Economist did the right thing, pulled down the headline. And then called me a radical conservative, which is strange because I don't know what would me particularly radical. Are there any non-radical conservatives in the opinion of The Economist? But I guess I'm a radical conservative. I can take alt-right was not a thing I was going to allow to stand. KURTZ: Yeah, you did push back. And you got the apology. From your book you say, we are angry at each other. The anger is palpable, where did it come from? So my question is you're an aggressive player in the partisan wars. Do you, does cable news, do the media contribute to and fuel this anger? SHAPIRO: I mean, I do think that, obviously, strong political conversation is going to lead to polarization. But the question is you can have strong political conversations where you disagree and you discuss and still love the person you're arguing with at the end of the day, if you feel you have the same shared goals, if you feel you have the same common base from which you are working. What seems to have happened is the sort of polarized battle we're seeing on cable news, I think, is a reflection of a deeper underlying unease with the fact that we don't have all that much in common anymore. The book really is an attempt to remind us we have a lot in common, with 3,000-year developmental history in western civilization. And that right, left and center, we all still should agree on certain basic principles, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, a government that is not empowered to invade our lives. These are concepts that we should all agree on, if we can't agree on those, then the arguments we're having right now actually carry an enormous amount of weight. And maybe we should be angry. KURTZ: So you see yourself as sort of slamming other people's policy, ideas, or views of ideology and civilization, but not demonizing them. Is that the distinction here? SHAPIRO: Absolutely. I mean, I hope that -- and I don't always succeed, but I certainly hope I'm attacking people's ideas and not them as human beings, or suggesting that they lack moral fiber, moral character, because we disagree on tax rates. KURTZ: Right. Now, when you went to speak at Berkeley, famously, protesters showed up. They shouted speech is violence, which is an interesting twist of meaning. You also say that despite the fact that you're an Orthodox Jew, you're routinely castigated as a Nazi. Where does that come from and just personally, how hurtful is that to you? SHAPIRO: I mean, obviously, on a personal level it is deeply -- it is deeply discomfiting. It is not a nice thing to be labeled a progenitor of the worst mass murder in histories against people who shared a religion with me. That's obviously ridiculous and silly and evil, frankly. But the general -- you know, the general polarization, it is -- we live in an era where it is very convenient to tear down your political opposition by labeling them lack -- by labeling them morally insufficient, that they have a lack of character. And that is a sign not only of bad politics, but bad underlying motivation. If you're slandering somebody's motivations without knowing the person, and knowing the motivation, the idea is they are innately bad because we disagree on political matters that we've disagreed on for years, year, and years. But my politics reflects white superiority because we disagree on affirmative action for example. Then you're not engaging politics. You're engaging in effectively character assassination and a certain form of tribal warfare. KURTZ: And there's way too much of that in the online sewer that some social media channels have become. I would agree with that. Ben Shapiro, congratulations on the book. Thanks very much for joining us. SHAPIRO: Thanks for having me. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: Still to come, the Chicago Tribune says, the dropping of charges against Jussie Smollett is indefensible. Why the media are furious he didn't even apologize for his hoax. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KURTZ: Much of the media embrace Jussie Smollett when the Empire actor claimed he had been beaten in the streets by two pro-Trump thugs. There was some soul searching. Police charged that he staged the whole thing, and anger in Chicago when Cook County prosecutors suddenly and mysteriously dropped the charges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL (D), CHICAGO: This is a whitewash of justice. You cannot have, because of a person's position, one set of rules apply to them and another set of rules apply to everybody else. KIM FOXX, COOK COUNTY STATE ATTORNEY: When I look at similarly-situated people who are charged with the same level of felony without a background, I believe in this case, justice was appropriate. JUSSIE SMOLLETT, ACTOR: I've been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one. This has been an incredibly difficult time, honestly, one of the worst of my entire life. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: I asked Donald Trump, Jr., in our interview about the media criticism he got for saying early on this sounded like a hoax. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, JR., AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN: I had the guts. And, again, I take a lot of heat for it. I'm willing to do that. But I had the guts to question it. KURTZ: And how do you feel about prosecutors dropping the charges without any apologize from Jussie Smollett? TRUMP, JR.: I think it's disgusting. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: And we're back with the panel. Clarence Page, your newspaper denounced the prosecutor's position to just drop the charges. Is the media achieved greater because of what Smollett put the country through with this racially-charged hoax that generated such emotional coverage. PAGE: Well, first of all, as in the case of this, there are a lot of questions that still need to be answered. And Jussie Smollett is still insisting on his innocence despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. And this was handled badly. All of a sudden, one day after all the money that's been spent trying to solve this case of Smollett's alleged attack, suddenly it's dropped one morning without much in the way of explanation, after the fact that we got to get an explanation because there was such an uproar over it. The Tribune's not alone in... KURTZ: I wanted to cite the local paper. It was also a political scandal, Emily, because Trump saying that the alleged attackers, these two Jamaican brothers, and he paid you know we're saying this is a country. The president announces that the Justice Department and FBI will invest it. Is that payback or perfectly appropriate? JASHINSKY: I think it's perfectly appropriate. What just happened this last week is baffling and reeks of corruption. The media did latch on to this narrative until the evidence became overwhelmingly against Jussie Smollett. And I think it's kind of funny right now that so many people in the media are outraged or shocked by the situation that happened because it speaks to just how ridiculous the allegation was in the first place. And I was all for investigating it. But you had outlets tweeting things that, basically, the baked-in narrative, was this happened. Stars rally to Jussie Smollett's side after the attack. KURTZ: Yeah. JASHINSKY: The implication is the attack... KURTZ: Right, right. PAGE: They were Hollywood stars. JASHINSKY: Right. KURTZ: They were two Nigerian brothers, I misspoke. What's most galling from a media perspective is police gather all this evidence and, look, even if he'd gotten community service, I'm not saying he should have gone to prison for 10 years. But prosecutors didn't even make him admit that he was not telling the truth and this was a hoax. Chicago justice? PAGE: That means a lot to judge's contrition. Former Governor Rob Blagojevich got a big sentence because he was so gregarious about it. The fact is this was the State's Attorney's Office that decided to drop this before it ever got to court. And that is another reason why people are griping about it. The due process was suddenly circumvented. And why, we note that part of the problem was Kim Foxx, the prosecutor, is a good friend of Michelle Obama's former chief of staff. So, now, the right-wing press especially... KURTZ: Yes. PAGE: We see conspiracy everywhere and the Obama's probably knew nothing about this. But nevertheless, it's a big deal. And everybody wants to pay attention to it. KURTZ: Just 20 seconds here, Emily. It's not clear whether Jussie Smollett's coming back to the Fox Show Empire. TMZ' Harvey Levin thinks the ratings might soar because he's so infamous. But I'm thinking a lot of people aren't going to watch this guy. JASHINSKY: I think the public has zero appetite for Jussie Smollett.

      "content": " \"The View\" liberal co-host Joy Behar criticized Ellen DeGeneres' defense of her appearance with former President George W. Bush,\u00a0claiming she doesn't see herself \"hanging with Donald Trump.\" The discussion began when host Abby Huntsman agreed with\u00a0DeGeneres about embracing those you \"disagree\" with, something Behar said she doesn't agree with \"100 percent.\" \"I always said I didn't want\u00a0to get to know George W. Bush because I knew I would like him. I knew I would because he seems like a likable kind of guy,\" Behar said. \"But if you lost a child in Iraq then you don't like him so much. And I don't see myself hanging out with Donald Trump anytime in this lifetime.\" \"So it's not only about disagreeing with somebody, which I certainly understand ... It's more than that,\" she said. MEGHAN MCCAIN: TRUMP, RAND PAUL, HAVE 'BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS' IN SYRIA FALLOUT Behar's\u00a0colleague Sunny Hostin agreed, invoking Bush's stance on marriage equality as president. \"When you think about the position that he took on gay marriage when he was in power and had the power to do something,\" Hostin explained. \"In 2004, when he was in a position to do something about it, he pushed for a constitutional amendment to make sure that marriage was defined as between a man and a woman.\" \"I think when you're a woman like Ellen \u2013\u00a0she continued \u2013\u00a0and you came out and changed the lives of so many people in the LGBTQ community, I can understand why there were people that were put off by seeing her doing that.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On Monday, DeGeneres addressed the backlash she received after appearing alongside Bush at last weekend's Dallas Cowboys game. \"Here's the thing: I'm friends with George Bush. In fact, I'm friends with a lot of people who don't share the same beliefs that I have,\" DeGeneres continued. \"We're all different and I think that we've forgotten that that's okay that we're all different... but just because I don't agree with someone\u00a0on everything doesn't mean that I'm not going to be friends with them.\" \"When I say, 'Be kind to one another,' I don't mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn't matter.\" Bush said he \"appreciated\" friend\u00a0DeGeneres'\u00a0comments. Bush's spokesman, Freddy Ford, told Fox News exclusively on Tuesday: \"President and Mrs. Bush really enjoyed being with Ellen and Portia (de Rossi) and appreciated Ellen\u2019s comments about respecting one another. They respect her. \"",

The idea of Trump attempting to serve longer than two terms \u2013 perhaps matching the four terms to which Democrat Franklin Roosevelt was elected before the 22nd Amendment took effect in 1951 -- has been a source of mainstream media speculation since Trump took office.

      "content": "This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" October 8, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right, Tucker, great show as always. Welcome to \u201cHannity.\u201d We begin tonight with a FOX News alert. We are now tracking multiple, major breaking stories, including an absolute bombshell development from the Department of Justice. FOX News now reporting that the Durham-Barr into the origins of the Russia witch hunt is expanding. FOX is reporting at this hour, quote, Mr. Durham has expanded his investigation and is adding agents, resources, according to multiple senior administration officials. The timeline now has grown from the beginning of the probe, through the election, and now includes a post-election timeline, through the spring of 2017, up until when Robert Mueller was named special counsel. And as we have reported on the show, Durham and Barr have spoken with multiple officials from the U.K., Australia, even traveled to Italy, all in an effort to determine if the most powerful tools of intelligence were used against our own citizens, with the purpose of illegally spying on American citizens, of course, to circumvent American laws and constitutional protection. By the way, that would be like FISA, premeditated fraud. I hear one of the saddest things for my sources tonight -- oh, they are worried if they can get a conviction in D.C. That shouldn't matter, should it? The law is the law. Was it verified or not verified? Now, we'll have answers to a lot of these questions coming that officials circumvent U.S. law, outsource surveillance, in the other sense, on Americans to allied spy agencies? In other words, you do this for us, and this way, we're innocent. And the Trump campaign, where they targeted by our own government agencies to bolster Hillary Clinton and hurt Donald Trump. Why was Mueller appointed in the first place? And according to another breaking FOX News report, tonight, Mueller was, in fact, pursuing the open FBI director job when he met with Donald Trump in 2017, as the president has been saying. He didn't get that position, and a short time later, he was investigating the president, who passed him over for a job. That would raise serious conflict of interest concerns, not to mention his close relationship with the man that Trump fired, Mr. Super Patriot, Jim Comey. And, by the way, what will the Horowitz investigation uncover about Super Patriot himself? And McCabe and Strzok, and many others who willfully committed fraud against the FISA cute. Now, imagine if any of you committed a premeditated fraud on the court, and you sign a document, an application for a warrant, take away the rights of an American citizen? Backdoor to the Trump campaign, so you could spy on his campaign, and later, his transition team, and then later, the presidency. Let's play this game at home. Do you think you would get away with any of that? It says \"verified.\" You know you didn't verify it. That's premeditated fraud on a court. And then when you know that you lied to the court, you're supposed to go back and tell them. I just have a funny feeling if it happens to anybody in this audience, you'd have a predawn raid, like Manafort and Roger Stone. And I've been saying this for a while, but what we witnessed in 2016 from our government, the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in our history. Now, the truth is going to come out. The big question I have tonight: will they hold their own accountable? I have sources telling me tonight they might be afraid to do that. Here with a full report on all of this is a very own Catherine Herridge tonight. CATHERINE HERRIDGE, CORRESPONDENT: Thank you, Sean, and good evening. A senior administration official confirms to FOX News that the investigation into the genesis of the 2016 FBI Russia collusion case is expanding based on the findings of U.S. attorney John Durham. Appointed by Attorney General William Barr in May, the investigation now has global reach, with Durham recently traveling to Britain and Italy to pursue surveillance leads, as well as working with Australian authorities. The investigation also adding more agents, more resources, for an expanded timeline which now stretches from the spring of 2016, to May 2017, when the president fired FBI Director James Comey and then Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, appointed special counsel Robert Mueller. Based on my two decades covering intelligence and law enforcement, the expanded Durham probe indicates that he has found evidence that likely points to criminal wrongdoing by reputation. Durham is not a prosecutor to ask for more help if there is simply no \"there\" there. Separately, administration officials tell FOX News there is new scrutiny of the Mueller appointment. Coordination between Rosenstein and Mueller in the days before the announcement, as well as allegations Rosenstein offered to wear a wire and secretly record the president, which he has publicly denied. Multiple administration officials tell FOX News that when Mueller met with the president on May 16th, 2017, he was indeed pursuing the post left open by the firing of Comey a week earlier. And they say newly released records back up the White House account. During his congressional testimony on the Russia probe, Mueller said he was not applying for a second term as FBI director. He said he was there to offer the president input on the required skills, Sean. HANNITY: All right. Catherine Herridge in Washington tonight, thank you. Also tonight, we're no longer going to refer to this ongoing political witch hunt, the latest witch hunt, on Capitol Hill, as any type of real impeachment inquiry. It is not. This is just the latest coup attempted over we, the people, over misconduct that does not exist yet again. Let us be clear, they never accepted the 2016 election results. They never accepted four separate investigations, no Russia collusion. That, instead, was a coup attempt. So, now, they went from one fishing expedition to another fishing expedition. Russia, Russia, Russia. That coup attempt. And then it was the tax return coup attempt. Then it was the Stormy, Stormy coup attempt. Now, it's the Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine coup attempt. That's all this is. They could not accept the will of the people. Insane, obsessive, compulsive, psychotic witch hunts, rooted in rage, and a lack of connection to reality that they lost. The same goal -- let's impeach him, and oh, we have a lot of ways we can impeach him, Nancy Pelosi says. The left -- they've been plotting impeachment of this president from the very beginning, the moment he was elected. We'll remind you.

JERRY NADLER, D-N.Y.: Articles of impeachment. HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: There should be an impeachment inquiry opened. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: There they are, talking impeachment. Started two days after the president's election. The hysteria that we see over Ukraine, that's just the latest coup attempt, the latest chapter in what has been three long years of lies, conspiracy theories, to take down a president, well, that they never wanted elected in the first place and did everything they could do to prevent him from winning. Also breaking moments ago, White House counsel has issued a letter to House Democrats formally announcing the Trump administration will not cooperate with the unconstitutional, invalid, baseless inquiry, because of three distinct issues -- first, the inquiry is constitutionally invalid, violates basic due process rights and separation of powers. There has been no vote to authorize this witch hunt, inquiry, and that means no due process, no ability for the president's lawyers to cross- examine witnesses, no ability of the president's lawyer to call witnesses. No ability to enter evidence into the record. Instead, all we got was a press conference from, yes, speaker in name only, Nancy Pelosi, and the cowardly, Shifty Schiff. Now, this is unprecedented and it's unconstitutional. The letter also goes on to state, quote: The invalid impeachment inquiry plainly seeks to reverse the election of 2016 and to influence the election of 2020. And according to the White House counsel, the effort to impeach President Trump without regard to any evidence of his actions in office is a naked political strategy that began the day he was inaugurated, and perhaps before. I would argue before. Impeachment is never to be used as a political weapon, only as a check against treason, bribery, high crimes, misdemeanors, and that brings us to the third issue raised by the White House counsel. Quote: There is no legitimate basis for your impeachment inquiry. Instead, the committee's actions, they raise serious concerns. Now, that would be like the cowardly Schiff making up something of a transcript that didn't exist. Where they announced the impeachment hearing, oh, we've got a variety of options if there's no quid pro quo there. Democrats claim the inquiry is about so-called whistle-blower, non- whistle-blower, account of a phone call between president Trump and the president of Ukraine. Well, the inquiry was announced before Democrats even saw the transcript of the call, or did they? Hmm, what did Schiff know and when did he know it? He is now the lead investigator running this committee. He would be a material, fact witness in this case, wouldn't he? That would then cause him to have to recuse himself. By the way, perfectly appropriate conversation with the president. We have the transcript. No need for non-whistle-blower whistle-blowers. And the government of Ukraine has said the call was totally appropriate. The U.S. Department of Justice has said the appropriate. The U.S. ambassador to the European Union said the president did nothing wrong. The special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, testified under oath, behind closed doors, no quid pro quo, no misconduct, no nothing. And let's not forget, the transcript has been released for everybody to see. We don't need a non-whistle-blower whistle-blower's account, and their feelings, and their political bent on any of this. Here's what Congressman Lee Zeldin had to say about this very issue that was earlier today. Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LEE ZELDIN, R-N.Y.: Maybe you should ask what was said inside of Volker's deposition, during his transcribed interview, with regards to Adam Schiff's fairy tale quid pro quo charge that aid from the United States to Ukraine was being linked to an investigation into the Bidens. Why don't you ask, what did Ambassador Volker say about that? That's a great question. I'm glad that you asked, and I will tell you the reason that question was so important for you to ask is for many things, because he was in this room for several hours. And during several hours of testimony, he talked about how President Zelensky had no idea there was a hold on aid at the time July 25th call. Ambassador Volker testified about the readouts of the phone call that was made to him, that he had -- that there was nothing in the readouts about there being a hold on U.S. aid or a quid pro quo. And, by the way, you know what else Ambassador Volker testified to? This entire time, the aid was getting released. It was going to get released. And guess what happened? The aid got released. And you know what didn't have to happen, there was no new investigation to get created. This whole thing is a fairy tale. Adam Schiff is misleading you, and you're playing along with it. When Adam Schiff said, for example, that President Trump was asking President Zelensky to manufacture dirt on the Bidens, do you know what Ambassador Volker testified to? That was absolutely untrue. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And for weeks, the cowardly, lying Adam Schiff, well, he wanted you to believe President Trump threaten to withhold U.S. aid to Ukraine if it didn't investigate sleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Joe 30330 and his son's shady Ukrainian deals, and for weeks, Schiff's stenographers, the media mob, breathlessly reporting about Trump-Ukraine quid pro quo, and yet again, it was one big giant hoax, another lie, another conspiracy theory. Three long years, one witch hunt after another, one coup attempt after another. Tonight, we have brand-new evidence proving beyond any shadow of a doubt, the left's hysteria is once again built on another bed of lies. Investigative reporter John Solomon has acquired documentation showing that a new investigation was opened by the country's prosecutor general four months before the phone call with our president and the new -- and the Ukrainian president, Zelensky, under Ukraine's prior president. And that's not all, John Solomon reporting also tonight, one focal point of the investigation was whether any of the $3.4 million in proceeds that Burisma Holdings paid to Hunter Biden's firm between 2014 and 2016 came from illicit sources. This happened months before the phone call in question, which is, by the way, huge, but there's even more. We have brand-new details about the non-whistle-blower whistle-blower. Byron York reporting tonight, he or she had a professional tie to a 2020 Democratic candidate. That means that he or she worked with or for one of the Democrats that is running against Trump. It will be a conflict of interest, too, especially when they are giving hearsay evidence in the first place. Let's recap. Non-whistle-blower whistle-blower, registered Democrat, clear political bias, professional relationship with one of the 2020 Democrats who want to beat Trump. This complaint based on hearsay, not firsthand knowledge, and also, media reports. Doesn't even matter what his complaint claims, because we know now, from the transcript, what was said and what wasn't said, don't we? And, by the way, the call in question shows no quid pro quo. Nothing. No funds were withheld from Ukraine. Ukrainian officials didn't even know the president was considering delaying aid at the time of the call. They didn't know until a month later, and two top diplomats in Europe said the president did nothing wrong. But then you got the cowardly Adam Schiff, a known congenital liar. And then you got Nancy Pelosi, another liar, who has lost all control over her party in the House. They want to boot a duly-elected president from office for nothing. What? A coup, and an attempt at every Democrat must go on record about. Any so called -- by the way, these so-called moderates, in other words, the Democrats that live in districts that Donald Trump won in 2016, they don't speak out against this unconstitutional attempted coup and witch hunt, they would be complicit, in this -- what is an illegal attempt to override the will of the American voter. Now, there is real, corruption and government abuse of power. And a quid pro quo, we actually have on tape. That would be Joe 30330 and the country of Ukraine, because as the media mob tries to ignore that brewing scandal, well, Senator Lindsey Graham, he is now invited the former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to testify before Congress about his lengthy investigation. And don't forget, we learned from \"Politico,\" what did we learn? Oh, yes, Ukraine was helping Hillary and they were involved in election interference in 2016. Yes. And, Joe, well, he shook down Ukraine and said you've got six hours. You fire -- you fire that prosecutor, or I'm taking my billion dollars -- our billion dollars, American people's billion dollars -- and I'm going home. You're not going to get it. And holy -- wow, they fired him. And he bragged about it. Here with more on this breaking report, brand-new -- by the way, starting tonight, we can officially announce, investigative reporter and a FOX News contributor -- JOHN SOLOMON, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, thank you. HANNITY: John Solomon, welcome to the family. It's been long time coming, sir. SOLOMON: Yes, thank you so much, it's great to be joining you guys, officially. Sean, I think you hit -- you hit it on -- you hit it on the head right from the beginning. I can confirm to you tonight that the U.S. c government had open source intelligence and was aware as early as February of 2019 that the Ukrainian government was planning to reopen the Burisma investigation. This is long m before the president ever imagined having a call with President Zelensky. In fact, it's before President Zelinsky was even elected. This is a significant shift in the factual timeline. This is information that was omitted from the whistleblower's complaint. Let me tell you what we learn today. The U.S. government was aware through open source intelligence in February that NABU, an FBI-like agency in Ukraine, that fights corruption, Joe Biden, he requested a reopen of the investigation into Burisma, its owner Zlochevsky, and unusual transactions in the Burisma accounts in February of 2019. On March 28th, 2019, the general prosecutor's office agreed to that request to open an investigation, and they filed a 15-page notice of suspicion, alleging that there may be illicit funds that were running through Burisma from 2010, all the way through 2015. That's important, because Hunter Biden was on the board for two of those years, 2014 and 2015. And specifically, that notice of suspicion said they were looking at the possibility that the $3.4 million paid to Hunter Biden's firm may have been part of the illicit funds that were moving through the company. A month later, in April, the prosecutor's office, open source intelligence -- again, U.S. government officials confirming they were aware of this, made a request of another investigative agency in Ukraine for assistance in going through these bank records. That is a significant change in the timeline. It was omitted from the whistleblower's complaint, and the question is, did he not know it, or did he exclude it because it didn't fit the narrative he was trying to write? That's a question for Congress to answer. HANNITY: You know, it's funny, because we've got Biden on tape, don't we? SOLOMON: We do. HANNITY: And we know the money -- I would like to know what exactly -- I guess Hunter Biden is 49 years old, he's not a kid. SOLOMON: Yes. HANNITY: But this is multimillion dollars that we're talking about. Can we get answers as to what exactly he did with no expertise in Ukraine, in oil, gas, or energy? Just like there's no background we can find with him in China or private equity, and that was a lot more money. SOLOMON: Right. HANNITY: According to Peter Schweizer, who joins us tonight, 1.5 billion. SOLOMON: So how is it that it is on tape, he is bragging about a shakedown using taxpayer money as leverage, and getting what he wanted? The prosecutor fired, and the prosecutor signed an affidavit, did he not come under the threat of perjury, that in fact he was fired because of Biden? Because of the six-hour threats and the threat of withdrawing American dollars and loan guarantees? SOLOMON: That's right. Yes. Listen, there's another oddity that comes out of the records. If you go back and put this back on screen, these are bank records from Hunter Biden's firm. If you remember, Hunter Biden and Joe Biden keep saying he was getting paid $50,000 a month. There is just one thing wrong with that. The FBI raided Devon Archer's office and bank records in an unrelated case in 2016. They show transfers of $166,000 a month, and as high as $220,000 in one month, going into Hunter Biden and Devon Archer's firm. That's a lot more than $50,000 and it was one of those things that piqued the Ukrainian prosecutor's interest in reopening the case in March of 2019. The size of the money was much larger than Joe Biden and Hunter Biden have been saying. HANNITY: All right. Let's go back. And we have the affidavit of his prosecutor. SOLOMON: Right. HANNITY: The prosecutors on record saying he got fired for this reason. We have multiple -- you know, there's no explanation. How is it that the mob and the media -- you've got quid pro quo here, you've got your legal actions here. How do they ignore that part of the story and say it is a conspiracy theory? And as Joe Biden, you know, very defensively keep saying, there's nothing to this story, nothing to this story. Well, there really is a lot to the story. SOLOMON: Listen, the media is stuck on one thing, which is that the United States government, Hunter Biden's control, and its allies in Western Europe, were claiming for sometime that Mr. Shokin was corrupted and therefore he should be removed. Even if that were the case, Joe Biden should have recused himself under the U.S. ethics laws paired let's leave that aside for a second, go back to some documents we talked about on your show two weeks ago. Hunter Biden's own American legal team, when they first meet with the prosecutor after Joe Biden fires Shokin, a new guy put in place, they immediately tell him there was a dirty trick campaign, a false information campaign Shokin look like he was corrupt so that they could get him out of there. That ought to be investigated. Listen, who knows what the truth is until we dig in? But the idea that the media has sunk into one theory of the case without looking at these other facts, they're not doing their job. There's a lot a facts that run against the current narrative that Adam Schiff and Joe Biden and the whistle-blower are telling, and we need to get the specs on the table and examine them fairly before we make any conclusions. HANNITY: All right, last question. SOLOMON: Sure. HANNITY: I keep hearing that the I.G. report is going to be devastating, but then I'm hearing on the other hand -- well, there's a lot of considerations about whether they can get a conviction. What they'll do is they'll embarrass everybody. And I'm thinking, well, either there is premeditated fraud on a FISA court, which we know happened. We know they lied. We know the statute also demands that when they find out the truth, that they go back to the court and tell them the truth. That never happened. SOLOMON: Yes. HANNITY: Is that the swamp protecting the swamp? Is that the likely outcome in this, John Solomon? SOLOMON: I think we need to wait and see. We just saw the expansion of the Durham investigation. Let's see -- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Birdies are singing in my ear. You know, I keep hearing this. SOLOMON: I've always said -- I've always said that I thought it was going to be a hard case for the Justice Department to prosecute, Sean. I still believe that. HANNITY: OK, so that means that anybody in his audience would be able to bring false information, they know that it's false, swear that it's true, and get a warrant to take away the rights of an American citizen, spy on a presidential candidate, transition team, and president, and you don't get indicted for that, John Solomon? SOLOMON: I hope that isn't true. I hope that there is accountability, but let's first see the facts before you make any conclusions. I always want to rest on the facts, not suppositions. HANNITY: We already know the facts. Don't we know that that -- don't we know there was FISA fraud? We know the facts. SOLOMON: I guarantee, you are going to learn a lot more facts in the next two weeks when this FISA report comes out. There is explosive new information in there. HANNITY: Let's see. SOLOMON: Thanks. HANNITY: Thank you. All right. When we come back, a lot of breaking news tonight. Andy McCarthy, Pete Hegseth, Dan Bongino, they react to all of this news and more, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Tonight, we have learned John Durham is expanding his probe into the origins of the Russia probe. Meanwhile, FOX News has learned that Mueller was in fact pursuing the FBI director job in 2017. That is contrary to what he testified to under oath. Here with more reaction to that explosive headline, author of the brand-new book \"Exonerated,\" FOX News contributor Dan Bongino. Also, FOX News contributor Andy McCarthy, and \"FOX & Friends\" weekend co-host Pete Hegseth. Andy, let me start with you. OK, we got Joe Biden on tape, that -- you know, bragging about a shakedown. I said, you're not getting the billion. You have six hours. Fire him in six hours, or you're not getting the billion dollars. Then we find out that it was his son that's making all this money with Ukraine and Burisma Holdings, no apparent experience with Ukraine, oil, gas, or energy. I'd like to know exactly what he did in his position for them. But nobody seems to care about that part. Is there anything in the transcript that you read that is inappropriate by the president of the United States, in his conversation, and you see a problem with what Joe Biden did? ANDY MCCARTHY, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I do see a problem with what Biden did in the sense that he had a conflict of interest, because his son had this position. As far as with the president said in the transcript, I think that asking Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, for assistance in Barr's investigation is fine. That's the kind of thing that is done all the time, asking another government for assistance in our investigations. Asking him about Biden getting a prosecutor fired, also seems fine to me, because if it's an element of Barr's investigation to show that the Obama administration was leaning on the Ukrainian authorities to investigate Manafort and potentially others in the Trump campaign. Then it's very relevant that Biden had that kind of influence and control over the Ukrainians. I would prefer if the President hadn't gotten into Biden's son, because to my knowledge there was no Justice Department investigation into Hunter Biden, and that does go on the line toward a President using his control over foreign policy-- HANNITY: Hey, hang on a second-- MCCARTHY: --in order to get information-- HANNITY: Andy I have January 11th, I have 2017 POLITICO. It outlines in great specificity the election interference of the Ukrainians in 2016 on Hillary's behalf. Now we have Joe Biden on tape demanding the firing using our tax dollars. MCCARTHY: Right. HANNITY: Now, as the President pointed out in the call with Zelensky a lot of corruption came from there. In this article it goes on to state unequivocally how Ukraine interfered in our elections. And we got the whole Biden issue. Why shouldn't we get to the bottom the President who is sworn to faithfully execute-- MCCARTHY: You are mixing up - you are mixing up two different things. HANNITY: Oh, yes, I'm mixing up many things. MCCARTHY: You are mixing up two different things. Going into what Biden did in connection with the Ukrainians that is Joe Biden is fine. That seems like it's very relevant to Barr's investigation. I don't see what Hunter Biden has to do with the 2016 election. I just don't see it. HANNITY: Well, I'm not conflating that you are pointing out-- MCCARTHY: And if there was a justice department-- HANNITY: --that they are two separate things that matter that we ought to get to the bottom of. Let me bring in Pete. MCCARTHY: They do matter. The question is, should the President have leaned on the Ukrainian President under those circumstances to get that information? And-- HANNITY: President is seeing-- MCCARTHY: I don't think that-- HANNITY: The President does have an obligation to know. Does he not constitutionally faithfully execute, uphold the laws of the land? So he sees the tape a Biden shaking - bragging about shaking down Ukraine, that would be wholly appropriate to me and he's watching the news like everybody else and he knew about the reports about Hunter Biden. So that to me would be appropriate. We got to get to the bottom of this like the rest of the mess that Ukraine admits that they helped Hillary Clinton. And the POLITICO acknowledges that they did play a role, so you got the two of them and they're both relevant to me. MCCARTHY: Well, you know, look, if you're going to take the position that that makes it relevant and that therefore justifies the President-- HANNITY: You think that tapes makes it irrelevant? MCCARTHY: --push it-- HANNITY: You don't think the Biden tape --? MCCARTHY: No, what I'm about to say is that - what I'm about to say is that, if that's going to be your position, then there's - what the other side is going to say is we're going to have to reevaluate whether the investigation that was done on the Trump campaign was driven by rightful suspicion or not. HANNITY: Pete. MCCARTHY: You can't have it both ways. It's either - it either is or it isn't. HANNITY: Pete. PETE HEGSETH, \"FOX & FRIENDS\" WEEKEND CO-HOST: You can't. And here here's part of the overarching problem, lies spread quickly, but it takes time for the truth to emerge. And in the lead to this segment was the Durham investigation, which is the single most important investigation in this country right now. He's looking into 2016. He thought it only went through the inauguration. Now it goes through the spring of 2017, because they're looking into the appointment of this special counsel where Bob Mueller - what you what you talked about tonight it's extremely significant. He sat in front of the President of United States. He lied to Congress about this, said he was never up for the FBI Director job. He interviewed for the FBI director job with the President when he knew that he and his buddy Rod Rosenstein had already made a deal that he would be the special counsel if he doesn't get the job. So when you look at why President Trump might be frustrated with what foreign governments might know, Durham and Barr are talking to foreign governments about what they may have known or participated in based on what the Deep State, which is not so deep, because it's actually quite at the top of that Deep State with Rosenstein and Comey and Mueller where collaborating and Durham has a chance to get to the bottom of it. You talk to average grassroots supporters of this President, they still demand accountability and the President channels that and that's why he asked these questions, because it hasn't been delivered yet. HANNITY: Let's, Dan Bongino, switch the names. It's Vice President Trump - I'm sure he'd hate the demotion. And let's see instead of Hunter, his name is Don Jr. and that - and Vice President Trump was doing the bragging about leveraging our tax money. DAN BONGINO, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, this is kind of hysterical. When you think about - we don't we don't have to bother switching the names, Sean, it already happened. Remember they were complaining about the Trump Tower Moscow project, by the way that never happened. No money actually changed hands. But here is the thing. Don Jr. actually does real estate and builds buildings. So let me get that straight, a perfectly legal construction project was turned into an international scandal. Although not a brick was ever laid, a dollar ever changed hands. Yet Hunter Biden with zero experience in natural gas, Ukraine or Ukrainian natural gas, gets an 80 plus thousand dollar-a-month gig. You couldn't find someone else who actually has propane in their house or something who has more experience than Hunter Biden? I mean, come on. This thing stinks to the heavens. Anybody without wearing rose-colored glasses can see that. HANNITY: I think what the President was saying to answer Andy's questioning and Andy is that - he's looking into all of it. President has - we have an obligation and a duty. He has an obligation, a constitutional duty to see that this type of corruption doesn't happen. I would argue that is a mandate for him. MCCARTHY: And he's do you think he's done that across the board, Sean? HANNITY: I do. MCCARTHY: Like everyplace that there's corruption, he's looked into corruption? HANNITY: No this is - well, I see it in this particular case everyone was so worked up, we spent two plus years-- MCCARTHY: Well, I'm asking you across the board-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: But I'm answering. If you listen-- MCCARTHY: You said, he's got a duty to do this. I'm asking you-- HANNITY: That's right. MCCARTHY: I'm asking you - asking you if you-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: --In this country - pay attention to the answer. In this country - we now live in a country, it's post constitutional America. We got to spy on a Presidential candidate transition in presidency. And to answer your question specifically, we spent three years on the issue of foreign country interference, and yet it happened and nobody cares about it having happened. True or false? MCCARTHY: That's false. I think a lot of people care about it happen, I just wrote a book about it happening. HANNITY: OK. Tell me whose else is talking about Ukraine and their support of Hillary in the last election, not many people, not many will look at-- MCCARTHY: Sean, there is a lot of people-- HANNITY: Go ahead. MCCARTHY: Sean, there is a lot of people looking into this and it should be looked into. HEGSETH: But in this case it's the nepotism of politically connected families, whether it's the Clintons or the Bidens who use their positions to enrich themselves, yet, that's the very thing they're accusing this President of doing, even though he goes there to try to change that equation. HANNITY: All right. Thank you all for being with us. When we come back President Trump says Hillary Clinton should jump in the race 2020. Wait to hear Hillary's response. Lara Trump is here, weighs in next, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. So the radical 2020 field of Democratic extreme radical socialist, that's in shambles. The one-time front-runner Joe 30330, he is losing ground. Elizabeth Warren is now facing major questions over yet another glaring lie. We'll have more on that later tonight. Meanwhile, guess who's tempted to jump into the race yet again? None other than twice failed Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. President today dared her to make another run. She tweeted don't tempt me, do your job. Here's the reaction to this and more is Senior Advisor to Donald J. Trump for President, President Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump. OK. Well, she wants to get in. I guess, the water is warm. But it looks like it's Elizabeth Warren's to lose. OK. She's going to give us top - marginal tax rate of 70 percent, 90 percent for corporations. We're going to also forgive all tuition, the new Green Deal and a wealth tax. That going to work for this country and Medicare for all. LARA TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW: Sounds great, doesn't it Sean? First of all, I just want to double down on the President and say if Hillary Clinton would like round two with Donald Trump, please let's do that. I would love to see a round two between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Because I think we all remember, Sean, not too long ago, all the media said that she was going to be the next President. We see Donald Trump in the White House now. It would be so easy to win, but I think it's going to be easy to win with any of these candidates. You're talking about Elizabeth Warren now who does look to be, I guess, the best hope they have, maybe that's why they're trying to bring Hillary back out, because they see how bad all these candidates really are. They've known from the beginning, Sean that they can't beat Donald Trump, because the reality is people in this country are winning again. Donald Trump has brought jobs back to this country. He has the lowest unemployment in the history of the country right. Now pretty much across the board we've ever seen he is winning on all fronts for the American people. They feel it every day. So while the mainstream media tries to pull the wool over their eyes, while the Democrats try these ridiculous impeachment type scenarios, time after time that never work, because it's all nonsense, Donald Trump is going to win, because the American people feel the results of the trump presidency every single day. So if it's Elizabeth Warren, if it's Hillary Clinton, we're ready. The President is willing to take whomever on because we know he's going to win. HANNITY: There's two things that, I see because - look, Russia's a coup attempt, taxes are coup attempt, Stormy is a coup - everything they want - like impeachment. I've did the impeachment timeline. They started two days after he was elected. They just - they were obsessed with it. But this is particularly interesting to me, because we read the transcript that everyone wants to talk about the whistleblower and non-whistleblowers, interpretation of the transcript we all read. There's nothing on there that says quid pro quo. President wanting - and I think Andy McCarthy is dead wrong on all of this. President wanting to get to the truth of the election interference of Ukraine on behalf of Hillary in the last election, we spent three years debating that. Number two, we got Joe Biden on tape admitting he leveraged a billion taxpayer dollars demanded the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor. Now why would a Vice President ever do that and nobody's allowed to talk about that? TRUMP: Yes, well, that is a quid pro quo right there, Sean. And I think it is perfectly acceptable for the President of the United States to want to clarify exactly what happened there. Because, quite frankly, I think the American people deserve to know what their Vice President was doing with a billion dollars. And we hear on tape, like you said, he tells the prosecutor this guy's got to go. He says the prosecutor has to go. It's a such a double standard, though, whenever you see what they're trying to do to this President. When to your point, we've all seen the transcript there was nothing there. But Sean they called for this impeachment inquiry before they even knew what was in this transcript, before they even knew what was in the phone call, doesn't matter. They want this President out. They are desperate and they're trying to do anything they can, but it's not going to work. I hate to tell them. HANNITY: And Pelosi is like we're going to impeach him for anything - for many reasons, well, do - we'll find something. I think, you look at all of that now. And Al Green, I think got it right, the Congressman, when he said we better impeach him, because we're not going to beat him. TRUMP: That's it. HANNITY: Pretty telling. TRUMP: He knew from the very beginning and we all know the truth too, but they'll never impeach him, Sean. They'll never get him out, because he is in for four more years for the American people, thank goodness. HANNITY: You know, the American people, I don't think, they're going to take these coup attempts lightly. Thank You Lara Trump. We get to see you're better half - well, yours better half Eric tomorrow. When we come back, Karl Rove, Charlie Hurt, we're going to look at the radical 2020 field. Do they have a shot? We will find out next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Elizabeth Warren is still in hot water tonight after resurface video suggesting she lied on the campaign trail when telling a story about being fired from teaching for quote \"being visibly pregnant\". According to the Washington Free Beacon, County records show that the Board of Education voted unanimously on a motion to extend Warren a second year of teaching. But still Warren is remaining defiant telling CBS News quote \"All I know is, I was 22 years old, six months pregnant. The job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else.\" Of course, Warren's trouble with the truth is nothing new. Here with reaction Fox News Contributors, Karl Rove, Charlie Hurt. Between what they're trying to do and may be likely, I guess, now, Karl, to do training with impeaching the President, which they won't get a conviction on. And one coup attempt after another. And now Elizabeth Warren seems like the likely favorite to win the nomination, where do you see the election going? KARL ROVE, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it's going to be a tough election. The Democrats are going to throw everything they can at the President. By the time we get around to the selecting the Democratic nominee next spring, they will have dusted him up with impeachment, and they will becoming hard after him. And the President can't take this for granted. She is left-wing. She's out there on the fringe. But there have been in the RealClearPolitics average, I think there have been 45 polls thus far this year matching President Trump and Elizabeth Warren. He has led her in five. The last one was in July. He's been tied with her in five and she's been ahead of him in 35 out of 45 polls. Admittedly not by much, four and a half points is the latest average in the RealClearPolitics average. But the President cannot take a race against Elizabeth Warren for granted. And he's going to need to dig in and show the differences between the two of them in great detail. And he's also going to have to show that he's got a vision for the second term, that's better than the vision she's offering for her first. HANNITY: You think the American people see this, Karl, and they are finding it repulsive? Well, we got an election in a year, and like OK, well, this doesn't work, I'll just find another reason to impeach him-- ROVE: Yes sure. HANNITY: Because to me it's just they want them out of office period. They don't - they never accepted he won, they never accepted the Mueller report. ROVE: Yes. And look this is why I thought the tone the President had a day or two ago when it was like - look, I understand why he's angry. I understand he doesn't feel fairly treated by the system, that this is distinctly unfair. But I thought his tone a day or two ago was good. He said basically it's a witch-hunt. But I'm going to stay focused on the big things the American people want me to do. And he's got a chance here with the China trade deal with USMCA, with the other initiatives of the administration to show that, even in the midst of having everything thrown at him by the Democrats, he's still focused on what he thinks is best for the Americans-- HANNITY: That's good advice-- ROVE: --people and I think that'd be a strong contrast. HANNITY: And his list of promises he made and kept are pretty significant, Charlie? CHARLIE HURT, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. No, I think the Democrats have really shot themselves in the foot. I think that for all of the flaws that Joe Biden had, I think, he was probably their best shot at trying to steal back those voters that Donald Trump stole from them in 2016. And it looks like in this whole effort to destroy the President they've taken out that best chance. You know, people like Elizabeth Warren - the things that - the proposals she's peddling, I talked to a lot of Democrats back home, I don't ever hear anyone say. You know what I really want. I want somebody to decriminalize border crossing. I want free health care for illegal aliens that's something you never hear Democrats back home talk about. And then you add on top of the fact that she apparently has a real problem with the truth, and is willing to make up stories relating to absolutely anything-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: political point - you're convinced she gets it. Karl, are you convinced she gets it, Charlie? HURT: I think there is a very good chance that she gets it. ROVE: Yes, I think Charlie's right in that. But we got a long way to go here, and there can be lots of twists and turns. I do think the field was claps down to Biden, Warren - maybe Sanders. Oh, boy he mishandled the whole heart attack thing, and may not be able to recover from damaging his credibility with the American people, let alone his health. But we got to be careful. She's about ready to get her turn in the barrel and how she handles it is going to be a big test of her, and there's a chance for Biden to come back. But this thing that's got a long way to go before it settled into what it's going to be. HANNITY: Last word, Charlie. HURT: Yes. And whoever the nominee is, Donald Trump has to - and his supporters have to treat it like it's the fight of their life, because it's going to be tough. HANNITY: All right guys, thank you. \"Villain of the day\" and more \u201cHannity\u201d right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. \"Villain of the day\", Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez who is now suggesting we abolish prisons. Great, well, let everybody go free - murderers, rapists. Anyway, tweeting, \"We have a real neat - need to have a real conversation about decarceration, prison abolition in this country.\" OK. Bad idea, because there are really bad people in the world, need to keep them behind bars. All right, that's unfortunately all the time we have left this evening. We always thank you for joining us. And we will never be the hate-Trump media mob. Let not your heart be troubled, straight from the sewer, the swamp, Laura Ingraham. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

      "content": " When it comes to President Trump's performance, Brad Pitt believes there are\u00a0bigger things to worry about than tariffs on foreign booze. When French outlet Journal du Dimanche asked the \"Ad Astra\" star (and Chateau Miraval vineyard co-owner)\u00a0his feelings on Trump's proposal to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on French wine, he was candid. \u201cI do not know [enough about the issue],\" Pitt, 55, admitted. \u201cI think we will always drink ros\u00e9 in the United States. If there is a threat to the winemakers, it is a real concern,\u201d he said, adding that ultimately, whether or not Trump does impose tariffs on French wine, there are much bigger issues at stake. BRAD PITT: 'AD ASTRA' IS ALSO ABOUT TOXIC MASCULINITY \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s almost anecdotal,\" he said. \"Trump represents a much bigger threat on such more serious issues.\u201d It's not the first time the actor has spoken out about Trump.

The Rolling Stones frontman, 76, blasted Trump for \"tearing apart\" America and not working hard enough to combat climate change. \"The U.S. should be the world leader in environmental control but now it has decided to go the other way,\" he said, per THR.

      "content": "When President Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports last month,\u00a0America's largest nail manufacturer had little choice but to raise its prices. Mid Continent Nail Corporation quickly lost 50 percent of its orders as customers opted for cheaper suppliers. Within weeks, the firm had to lay off 60 workers. Up to 200 more might lose their jobs by the end of this month. If the tariff isn't lifted, the company could fold by September. Mid Continent and its employees are early victims in Trump's trade war. There will be many more if the president continues to raise import costs and anger our trading partners. Since the start of the year, President Trump has announced a string of new tariffs - which, let\u2019s be clear, penalize Americans who buy imports. In January, he imposed tariffs on Americans who buy solar panels and washing machines.\u00a0 In March, he directed the U.S. Trade Representative to levy $50 billion in additional tariffs on Chinese imports.\u00a0 And then in June he applied tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. This escalation shows no sign of slowing. Trump just announced that his administration is preparing to impose another $200 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, on products ranging from pickles and pastries to refrigerators and air conditioners. To repeat: American consumers -- not foreigners -- will ultimately pay the bulk of the price for these trade obstructions. The economics are simple. Consider cars. Trump has long made clear that he wants Americans to pay higher prices for cars coming into the nation. On the campaign trail, he promised a tariff of 35 percent on \"every car, every truck, and every part manufactured in Ford's Mexico plant that comes across the border.\"\u00a0 This past March, he threatened to impose tariffs on Europe' automobile manufacturers. But even cars produced domestically will rise in price thanks to the president's economically illiterate trade interventions. As raw materials such as steel and aluminum rise in price, the cost of manufacturing each vehicle will rise. Manufacturers will pass those higher costs on to consumers. Even beer and soda manufacturers are fretting about higher aluminum costs! The damage extends beyond our wallets and pocketbooks. As domestic manufacturing costs increase, the competitiveness of some American producers decreases. Consider American Keg Company of Pennsylvania. Already, the company laid off a third of its workers due to rising steel costs.\u00a0 Or take General Motors. The automobile giant has announced it might have to lower wages and cut jobs. The energy sector will also take a hit. Because American steel companies don't produce the specialty pipes needed for many pipelines, new infrastructure projects will cost a whole lot more -- or be cancelled entirely. Plus, tariffs aren't a one-way street -- trading partners will hit back by imposing their own taxes on American exports. China has already announced retaliatory tariffs on more than a hundred U.S. products like beef, poultry, and automobiles \u2013 and has threatened to stop purchasing oil and natural gas from America.\u00a0 The European Union, Canada, and Mexico plan to hit major American exports like whiskey and motorcycles. The U.S. economy is booming -- but it depends on trade. Exports support 10 million U.S. jobs,\u00a0imports support another 16 million,\u00a0 and every single one of us has a life that's full of items manufactured abroad. Trump\u2019s trade war means higher prices for American consumers, lower margins and less revenue for U.S. firms, and worse jobs for workers. It's economic suicide.",

      "author": "Ivanka Trump",
      "content": " In September 2016, when then-Republican presidential primary candidate Donald J. Trump called for a national paid family leave plan, pundits called it \u201ca striking departure from GOP orthodoxy.\u201d Indeed it was. But over the past 21 months, we have witnessed conservatives building a majority in support of this important policy. In conversations with members of the GOP, there is burgeoning agreement on the intrinsically conservative nature of a national paid family leave plan. Social conservatives underscore paid leave as a way to forge more tightly bonded families and protect infants and parents at their most vulnerable. Fiscal hawks recognize the efficiency of increasing workforce attachment and minimizing government dependence. And everyone shares the concern for our country\u2019s plummeting fertility rates, now the lowest in history, and the effect that will have on our society and economy at large. If executed responsibly, paid family leave is targeted government action with the right incentives \u2013 designed to increase the independence, health and dignity of our citizens. Some 25 years ago, Congress passed, with bipartisan support, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. The legislation granted eligible American workers 12 weeks of unpaid leave. Now we have a historic opportunity to build on this progress. Without debating the value and merits (of which there are many) of paid leave legislation supported by members of the Republican and Democratic parties, we must recognize their failure to gain majority consensus within or across party lines. Hence, our focus must turn to policy ideas that can secure congressional approval. Included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is an important provision introduced by Senator Deb Fischer, R-Neb., to incentivize businesses nationwide to offer workers up to 12 weeks of paid family leave. This business credit of up to 25 percent is a foundational step in achieving a national plan. But a tax credit alone will not suffice. Republicans are committed to developing a plan for working parents. In working with Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., \u2013 chairman of the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions and Family Policy \u2013 we agreed on the urgent need for earnest bipartisan debate in order to address this issue. Under\u00a0Sen. Cassidy\u2019s\u00a0leadership and\u00a0in coordination with the White House,\u00a0his subcommittee will hold a hearing Wednesday on paid family leave, giving this critical issue real bipartisan momentum for the first time. No doubt, members of Congress will have diverse opinions about how to structure the policy and how to pay for it. But rather than allowing differences to prevent progress, our lawmakers are coming together to find the best solution. Republicans are at the table, with sincere interest and rolled-up sleeves, looking for smart policy solutions that will empower American working families. Paid family leave enables parents to balance the competing demands of work and family, pursue their careers, and build strong and thriving families. It is an investment in the future of our workers, our families, and our country. As our lawmakers arrive to the negotiating table, let us applaud their efforts, encourage them to reach across the aisle, and create smart and lasting policy that does right by all.",

      "content": " President Trump \u2013 my father-in-law \u2013 changed the life of one woman and her family last week when he commuted the life prison sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a black single mother who served more than 20 years of a horribly unjust punishment for a non-violent drug conviction. \u201cThis is the greatest day of my life, my heart is just bursting with gratitude for what has ... happened to me today,\u201d exclaimed Alice Johnson upon her release from prison. \u201cI want to thank President Donald John Trump \u2013 Hallelujah! \u2013 for giving me another chance at life and restoring me to my family.\u201d I\u2019m not surprised at this reaction. The Donald Trump I know is the Donald Trump that Alice Marie Johnson now knows. And, if more Americans get the chance, this is the Donald Trump they\u2019ll come to know, too. When you give him a chance, you learn that President Trump cares deeply about fairness and justice and will do everything in his power to correct the past failures of the political class in Washington. Alice Johnson was sentenced to life in prison in 1996 \u2013 thanks to the President Clinton-era \u201csuper-predator\u201d policies \u2013 for her involvement in a cocaine ring as a go-between for the dealers. She never actually handled drugs herself. While in prison, Johnson became a grandmother and great-grandmother, spending 22 years of her life behind bars for a mistake she made while trying to provide for her family after losing her husband to divorce, a son to an accident and her home to foreclosure. Johnson pleaded her case to President Obama for a pardon on three occasions, and he denied her three times. When my father-in-law learned from Kim Kardashian West the full extent of this awful miscarriage of justice, he knew he had to act out of a deep sense of fairness and compassion. That's why President Trump pardoned Alice Johnson. It\u2019s also why he posthumously pardoned Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight boxing champion, whose unjust conviction was motivated by racism. It\u2019s why he asked protesting NFL players to help him deliver justice to those they believe are unfairly incarcerated. These acts of justice by President Trump have significant implications, and not just for those pardoned and their families. President Trump\u2019s sentence commutations \u2013 along with his restorative prison reforms and economic policies \u2013 will positively impact an entire generation of Americans subjected to judicial and economic injustices. The Trump administration is pursuing prison reform and creating the economic conditions to lift women such as Alice Johnson out of poverty and to ensure that no mom will have to go through what she has been through. That\u2019s why the president is such a huge supporter of the FIRST STEP Act. This bipartisan bill, which President Trump worked with Democrats to help pass in the House of Representatives in May, is supported by the Urban League and the Equal Justice Initiative. It addresses the negative impacts of mass incarceration by giving inmates another chance at life. The bill creates a new system for prisoners to earn early release for good behavior, expands evidence-based re-entry programs, and also provides new job training, drug treatment and life counseling. President Trump is also fighting injustice through his economic policies \u2013 a combination of tax cuts, deregulation, and fair trade policies \u2013 that have resulted in the lowest black unemployment rate on record Many politicians have spent years talking about wanting a fairer America, but President Trump is actually making it happen. It\u2019s the president\u2019s strong sense of fairness that underlies so much of what he does and has accomplished. Kim Kardashian West and Alice Marie Johnson gave the president the opportunity to show who he is, and now they know the Donald Trump I know. Hopefully, more Americans will also come to know the Donald Trump I know \u2013 caring, compassionate, and delivering justice with humanity for all Americans, especially those who were wrongly punished in the first place.",

      "author": "Donald Trump Jr.",
      "content": "  President Trump just scored a huge win for sportsmen and women by signing a sweeping, bipartisan bill that will dramatically loosen restrictions on hunting and fishing on public lands. As avid lovers of the outdoors, this is a big win for our families, as well as for the families across Montana and this nation who cherish their time outside as much as ours do. Named after the late John D. Dingell, the longest-serving member of Congress in history and an avid sportsman who passed away last month at the age of 92,\u00a0S. 47\u00a0includes numerous provisions that not only make it easier for sportsmen to access public lands, but also make it harder for the government to close off those lands for their use. Most importantly, the legislation permanently\u00a0reauthorizes\u00a0the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Plain and simple, LWCF exists to expand public access to federal lands. Currently, an estimated\u00a010 million acres\u00a0are inaccessible to the public. This means only a select few sportsmen and women can access some of the best hunting and fishing opportunities our country has to offer. DONALD TRUMP, JR.: BIG TECH COMPANIES CAN'T DISGUISE THEIR GROSS HYPOCRISY \u2013 THEY ARE FREE SPEECH PRETENDERS The new law also takes significant steps toward ensuring that future federal officials cannot arbitrarily restrict sporting activities on federal lands, clarifying that all federal lands are open to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting unless otherwise designated by the Secretary of the Interior. The Trump administration has been an unfaltering friend to sportsmen like us. Unfortunately, future administrations may not be so well-disposed to that lifestyle. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important this package of bills are now law \u2013 to prevent any future effort to prohibit hunting and fishing on lands that are owned by the American people. This is yet another example this administration\u2019s commitment to keeping its promises. The importance of access to public lands was a major focus for both of us when we were on the campaign trail together in 2017 and 2018, and we couldn\u2019t be happier with what we\u2019ve achieved since then. For us, two people who have spent countless hours and days enjoying our public lands in Montana and across the country, this law protects our way of life. This law, which protects our access to some of the most amazing parts of Big Sky Country, and other states in all corners of our country, will allow us to instill our love for the outdoors in our kids and grandkids. Thanks to S. 47, the Interior Secretary must consult with state wildlife officials and allow for public notice and comment before closing off any parcel of public land to sporting activities. Temporary closures are limited to 180 days and can only be renewed up to three times, but must also be narrowly justified. Permanent closures, meanwhile, require the Secretary to extensively document the rationale for the decision, how the Department responded to concerns raised through public comments, and demonstrate that closing the land was necessary. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Further, the new law also authorizes the Secretary to lease or permit the use of public lands for shooting ranges, which currently have to navigate a complex web of local, state, and federal regulations, and frequently face organized opposition from anti-gun activists. This bipartisan public lands package is a tremendous victory for us, our children, and our grandchildren. We applaud President Trump for this new standard of access to our public lands \u2013 something that all of us sportsmen and women can appreciate.",

The same companies that shamelessly censor conservatives and tilt public discourse in the left\u2019s favor have suddenly decided they\u2019re into \u201cfree expression.\u201d House Democrats recently\u00a0rewarded\u00a0their Big Tech backers by holding a hearing titled \u201cPreserving an Open Internet for Consumers, Small Businesses, and Free Speech.\u201d FACEBOOK DOESN'T REALLY BELIEVE IN FREE SPEECH. WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN (AND ACTIVELY PRACTICE) IS CENSORSHIP No, Twitter, Google, and Facebook haven\u2019t suddenly decided to stop\u00a0working\u00a0with left-wing groups to stigmatize and silence their political enemies, and the Democrats certainly weren\u2019t there to address Big Tech\u2019s growing list of privacy and bias scandals. The whole point of the hearing was to help these monopolies present themselves as defenders of free speech and competition while they advocate for a return to the \u201cnet neutrality\u201d policies that help their bottom line. Although there were no representatives from the \u201cbig three\u201d tech companies present at the hearing, all three have been vociferous advocates of net neutrality, and that perspective was amply represented. Back in 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed these burdensome Obama-era regulations. Both CNN and socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0told\u00a0us that meant the \u201cend of the internet as we know it.\u201d Nancy Pelosi\u00a0called\u00a0it a \u201cTrump assault\u201d that \u201cset into motion the destruction of the free and open Internet.\u201d Every Big Tech gatekeeper from Amazon to YouTube put their differences aside and\u00a0used\u00a0their combined platforms to\u00a0whip\u00a0consumers into a frenzy to \u201csave net neutrality.\u201d Some people literally took to the streets. A few people took it way too far. As The Boston Globe\u2019s Jeff Jacoby\u00a0wrote, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai \u201dwas showered with\u00a0racist insults\u00a0(Pai is Indian-American) and\u00a0death threats -- some of them serious enough to compel Pai to\u00a0cancel major public appearances.\u201d Signs posted near Pai\u2019s home\u00a0invoked his young children by name, and charged that their \u201c\u2018Dad murdered democracy in cold blood.\u2019\u201d All this was over a complicated regulation that most of the protesters couldn't even explain beyond the catchy \u201cnet neutrality\u201d moniker. Obviously, \u201cthe Internet as we knew it\u201d didn\u2019t end. Speedy high-speed browsing was not replaced by endless pinwheel loading icons. Not a single website is even claiming they were blocked by a vindictive Internet service provider. In fact, Internet speeds are estimated to have\u00a0increased\u00a0by 40 percent since the end of so-called \u201cnet neutrality.\u201d The Internet works just fine. \u201cNet neutrality\u201d is a fake controversy, ginned up to give cover for certain tech giants wanting to\u00a0save some money\u00a0at the expense of some other, slightly less massive companies. For Silicon Valley lobbyists working for companies like Twitter to claim it\u2019s all in the name of \u201cfree speech\u201d is rich. Twitter had the nerve to\u00a0beg\u00a0the federal courts to overturn the FCC\u2019s decision and put Barack Obama\u2019s tech policy back in place, arguing it would protect, \u201cinnovation, consumer choice, and free expression.\u201d This is the same company that is\u00a0suspending\u00a0conservatives and journalists right now because they dare to tweet the words \u201clearn to code.\u201d For those who don\u2019t know, \u201clearn to code\u201d is a joke poking fun at liberal journalists who mocked blue-collar Americans who\u2019d lost jobs to globalization. For years, these self-appointed coastal tastemakers blithely assured working-class Americans in the heartland that they had nothing to complain about. They could just become computer programmers. When the bottom dropped out on left-wing, online click-bait last month, hundreds of\u00a0Buzzfeed,\u00a0VICE, and\u00a0HuffPo\u00a0workers were laid off. Fittingly, people told them it was no big deal, they could \u201clearn to code\u201d -- just like the\u00a0coal miners\u00a0and the other laid-off workers. In a shocking indication of just how deep liberal journalists\u2019 self-important victim complex goes, they tried to claim it was all a \u201chate\u201d campaign aimed at \u201charassing\u201d them. They\u00a0tattled\u00a0to Big Tech to come save them and Twitter quickly obliged by suspending accounts that engaged in the light-hearted trolling. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sorry, Twitter, but the \u201cfree speech\u201d schtick just isn\u2019t credible when you\u2019re simultaneously suspending people for a joke that made a few liberal journalists feel badly. The same goes for Facebook, Google\u00a0and every other Big Tech corporation trying to convince the American people that they support free expression even as they systematically stifle the viewpoints held by half the country. Despite having the political cover from their liberal soulmates who now control the U.S. House, Big Tech companies can\u2019t disguise their gross hypocrisy.",

      "content": " For many Americans, the Great Recession brought dark days we will never forget \u2013 and never want to repeat. It wasn\u2019t long ago that economists told us sluggish growth and flat wages were here to stay. Pundits talked about a \u201cjobless recovery.\u201d And politicians promised hope and change but never delivered. But now, thanks to Republican leadership, the United States has the best economy in the history of our country \u2013 and hope has finally returned to cities and towns across America. Since I was elected, we have created 4.5 million new jobs. In the last month alone, we added another 250,000 jobs, and nearly a half-million Americans returned to the workforce. We have added nearly 500,000 manufacturing jobs to our economy \u2013 jobs that many self-proclaimed experts said would never return. The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in nearly 50 years. More Americans are working today than ever before. And wages are now rising at the fastest rate in a decade. Today, if you want a job, you can get a job. If you want a better job, you can get a better job. African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans have the best job prospects in history. The employment outlook for women is the best in more than 65 years. Students graduating from high school and college are entering the workforce with an abundance of opportunities. These things didn\u2019t happen by accident. They happened because Republicans are putting American workers and families first. To reclaim America\u2019s competitive edge, Republicans passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. In addition to saving the average family $2,000 per year, our tax cuts kicked off a growth boom as businesses expanded and hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign profits flooded back into our country. By doubling the child tax credit, providing a $500 tax credit for non-child dependents, and lowering tax rates, Republicans delivered the tax relief that working families need and deserve. Republicans have waged the largest regulatory reduction campaign in our history \u2013 eliminating unnecessary regulation after unnecessary regulation that killed jobs and drove businesses overseas. We have unleashed American energy resources. We ended ObamaCare\u2019s punitive individual mandate and created new, affordable health-care options with lower premiums for families and businesses.\u00a0And we are fixing broken trade deals and cracking down on foreign trading abuses that have, for decades, plundered America\u2019s wealth. Democrats adamantly, aggressively and hysterically opposed every one of these policies. The top Democrat in Congress even predicted our tax cuts would lead to \u201cArmageddon.\u201d But here we are, two years later, and America has never been more prosperous or more optimistic. Now America faces a critical choice: whether to build on the extraordinary prosperity that Republican policies have delivered for our nation \u2013 or whether to allow Democrats to take control and take a giant wrecking ball to your economy and your future. If House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., take control of Congress, they will drag America back into the economic abyss we struggled so hard to climb out of. The Democrats have promised to raise taxes, restore job-killing regulations, restrict American energy production, and impose socialism through a government takeover of your health care that would bankrupt our country with a $32 trillion price tag. Put simply, the Democrats will pursue economic policies that are the exact opposite of the successful policies that Republicans have implemented. Democratic economic policies will drive our factories overseas, destroy the American health-care system, and obliterate American jobs, American wages and American wealth. We have already tried the Democratic way \u2013 and it produced the worst so-called economic recovery on record. Why would we ever go back? Instead, I am asking you to vote for a Republican House, a Republican Senate, and Republican governors so we can continue the incredible economic success that families across the nation are now enjoying. America\u2019s red-hot economy is the envy of the world, and it is only getting stronger every day. A strong jobs economy helps working Americans lift up the people they love: children, parents, friends, and neighbors. A strong jobs economy also means that our government can protect the American people with the strongest military in the world, protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors, protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, and protect our borders. With your vote for Republican candidates, we can keep our economy growing and our nation on the right track. With your vote, we will keep lifting millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. And together, we will build a future of safety, security, prosperity, and freedom for all our citizens.",

      "content": " There\u2019s no denying that\u00a0President Trump was the driving force behind the Republican victories in North Carolina\u2019s special elections Tuesday, spoiling liberal plans to spin the results into a rebuke of his presidency. The mainstream media tried to turn the special election in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District into a referendum on the president, portraying the district as a bellwether for how voters in suburban areas might vote in the 2020 presidential election. By doing so, the media hoped to craft a win-win narrative for the Democrats. Victory would mean that Democrats had flipped a district that candidate Donald Trump won in 2016, while a narrow margin of defeat could be spun as a sign that suburban districts are at least in play for 2020. REP-ELECT DAN BISHOP CREDITS TRUMP FOR SPECIAL ELECTION WIN IN NORTH CAROLINA RACE When the results came in showing that Republican Dan Bishop had won by about a two-point margin, the left immediately set about trying to\u00a0claim victory in defeat. The circumstances surrounding the race, however, suggest a very different takeaway. Dan Bishop needed help badly. He was hampered from the outset by his party affiliation, for instance, because the whole reason for the special election was alleged\u00a0voter fraud\u00a0on the part of the GOP candidate who ran for the seat in 2018. Bishop\u2019s opponent, meanwhile, was a Marine Corps veteran and political outsider who avoided controversial issues with vague platitudes, positioning himself as a middle-of-the-road moderate. Even so, the Democrats didn\u2019t want to leave anything to chance,\u00a0outspending\u00a0Bishop\u2019s campaign by a factor of more than two-to-one. In fact, the Bishop campaign was down\u00a017 points just three weeks ago, indicating that the district\u2019s historical record of voting for Republican candidates had little relevance in this unique situation. This is presumably why Democrats and the media chose the 9th District rather than\u00a03rd District congressional special election in North Carolina to use as a litmus test of the president\u2019s re-election chances. The concurrent special election in the 3rd Congressional District, which Republican Dr. Greg Murphy won handily, took place under much more typical circumstances, with vote shares\u00a0closely matching\u00a0the partisan makeup of the district. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Once President Trump got more closely involved with Bishop\u2019s campaign, however, Bishop\u2019s race quickly began to tighten up, turning it into a statistical dead heat by the time the election rolled around. Even Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos was\u00a0forced to admit\u00a0that the president\u2019s rally in Fayetteville on the night before the election was a decisive factor in putting Bishop over the top, contradicting her party\u2019s narrative about Trump\u2019s supposed electoral weakness. DEMS ADMIT TRUMP HELPED GOP CANDIDATES SWEEP NORTH CAROLINA SPECIAL ELECTIONS If the election in the 9th Congressional District was a referendum on President Trump, as the left claimed it was, then the miraculous turnaround in Bishop\u2019s prospects actually indicates that the president\u2019s personal popularity remains the strongest advantage the Republican Party has in the 2020 elections.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The mainstream media and the Democratic Party establishment clearly thought that the North Carolina special elections would confirm their wishful thinking about President Trump\u2019s electoral appeal. Instead, Dan Bishop\u2019s victory just proved that the president is still as potent a political force as ever. What should be most distressing of all for the Democrats is the knowledge that President Trump will be able to leverage that popularity to boost Republican candidates all over the country in 2020, just like he did for Dan Bishop in North Carolina.

      "author": "Donald Trump Jr.",
      "content": " These days, obstruction by the Democrats grabs the biggest headlines when they prevent solutions to the biggest issues \u2013 immigration, Supreme Court appointments, infrastructure, and so on \u2013 but their obstruction is actually the most egregious when it\u2019s at its most petty. Confirming U.S. ambassadors should be one of the least political things the U.S. Senate does. For most of the country\u2019s history, the process was a mere formality \u2013 a president would pick people to serve as America\u2019s chief representatives to countries around the world, and those nominees would almost always be confirmed by voice votes, with little if any debate. It\u2019s a basic courtesy to the president, but, more importantly, it\u2019s a simple recognition that America should be represented by a duly-appointed ambassador in every country with which we have a formal diplomatic relationship. As it turns out, one of the unifying principles for the Democratic minority in the Senate under Chuck Schumer\u2019s leadership is its obstruction of ambassadorial appointments employed in frustration over the fact that Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t the one making those nominations. Therefore, they\u2019ve made even this basic, uncontroversial duty into a political football by subjecting the nominees to the tedious and time-consuming process of holding individual votes, delaying some appointments for more than two years. AMBASSADOR TO GERMANY: TRUMP DESERVES CREDIT FOR BRINGING IRAN TO THE TABLE, IS OPEN TO CUTTING NEW DEAL WITH REGIME America\u2019s diplomatic objectives \u2013 including those in some of the regions most critical to our foreign policy \u2013 are being hampered so that Chuck Schumer and the other Democrats can impress far-left donors and activists with how well they\u2019re \u201cresisting\u201d President Trump. Schumer and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., one of his fellow Democrat obstructionists, worked overtime to delay for eight months the confirmation of Richard Grenell, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany. Within three months of assuming his post in Berlin, on orders from the president, Ambassador Grenell secured Germany\u2019s consent to accept the deportation of the last known Nazi war criminal living in the United States. Menendez, with Schumer\u2019s support, effectively bought eight months of precious American freedom for a Nazi war criminal. You would think that situation alone would be enough to cause the Democrat \"resisters\" in the Senate to rethink their petty tactics. Sadly, though, their embarrassing obstruction has not only gotten worse but has become a direct threat to our national security. Take, for instance, Libya, a country that has been chaos for years now, is currently without an ambassador, a role that is crucial to bringing stability to the war-torn nation. We are also without ambassadors in Morocco, Egypt and the UAE, three countries that are vital to helping resolve the current conflict in Yemen. The lack of American diplomats in these countries could have truly dire consequences in the region. Even right in our own backyard, the U.S. embassies in Jamaica, Barbados, and the Bahamas all lack Ambassadors from the United States. When you dig into the data, the game Schumer is playing looks even more recklessly irresponsible. The last four U.S. ambassadors to Morocco were confirmed in an average of about three months. David Fischer, who received President Trump\u2019s nod to take up that post in December 2017, is still waiting. He didn\u2019t even get a hearing for the first 10 months, and since then, Democrats have continued to delay a confirmation vote, even as our friends in Morocco bemoan being relegated to a mere charge d\u2019affaires for more than two years. Even a former member of Congress such as Kenn George of Texas has been denied confirmation as out ambassador to Uruguay since April 2018 \u2013 a longer wait than the last five nominees to that post combined. The most outrageous delay of all, however, has been the one imposed on Doug Manchester, the eminent businessman and philanthropist my father nominated to serve as our ambassador to the Bahamas more than two years ago, in May 2017. In some ways, this sort of seemingly-petty obstructionism is even more nefarious than the big-ticket stuff, such as shutting down the government to prevent funding for a border wall or slandering Justice Brett Kavanaugh in a failed effort to keep him off the U.S. Supreme Court. Those ploys, because of their importance, entailed a serious political cost. They dominated the headlines, which in turn got Americans to become aware, involved, and outraged. Ambassadorial nominations are different. They are so historically uncontroversial and figure so little into the major political narratives in our country, that very few people even pay attention to them. Chuck Schumer knows that he can clog up the legislative agenda by forcing unnecessary individual votes, and he doesn\u2019t care how much damage his obstruction of these vital appointments might do to American diplomacy. This Senatorial pettiness is yet one more example of presidential harassment by the Democrats. Their obstruction, in this case, may not capture as many big headlines, but it is nonetheless harming U.S. relations with nations around the world. Gone are the days of Senatorial courtesy. Democrats today have held up numerous qualified nominees simply because they were nominated by President Trump. It is up to Republicans to realize that we aren\u2019t dealing with people willing to negotiate in good faith, but are rather dealing with stone-cold obstructionists hell-bent on \"resisting\" the president at every turn. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Enough is enough. There is a near-term solution, but it will require a display of political courage equal to the magnitude of the issues that we face as a nation. The Senate is getting ready for its annual August recess. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should cancel the recess until every one of the president\u2019s ambassador nominees are brought to a voice vote, as has been the custom in America for over 200 years. Leader McConnell and the Republican majority in the Senate must stand up to the rampant obstruction coming from the resistance Democrats and fight to ensure that my father\u2019s nominees are all given an up or down vote immediately. Then we can move on to address the next round of obstruction from the Democrats. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DONALD TRUMP JR.",

      "content": " President Trump is winning the immigration \u201cmessaging war\u201d for a reason \u2013 Americans are tired of listening to the Democrats\u2019 lies about border security. One prominent liberal think tank, the Center for American Progress, is warning that the Democrat Party\u2019s radical stance on immigration is helping to create \u201cthe false dichotomy of America as either a nation of immigrants or a nation of laws,\u201d putting Democrats in the position of defending lawlessness. The Daily Beast, a progressive news outlet that frequently attacks my father\u2019s immigration policies, interpreted the study as a sign that Democrats are \u201closing [the] immigration messaging war to Trump\u201d because their rhetoric is \u201cmaking the party and its candidates appear soft on enforcement\u201d while also likely \u201cweakening future attempts for humanitarian-focused immigration reform.\u201d DONALD TRUMP, JR.: DEMOCRATS' PETTY OBSTRUCTION OF AMBASSADORIAL CONFIRMATIONS MUST END NOW The Daily Beast and the Center for American Progress are half-right \u2013 the Democrats are losing the debate on immigration, but it\u2019s due to their radical policies, not their messaging. Their failure to persuade the American people to support their extreme immigration proposals, including open borders and \u201cfree\u201d health care for illegal aliens, is more than just a rhetorical mishap that can be fixed with a better \u201cmessaging\u201d strategy. The Democrat Party and its 2020 presidential candidates don\u2019t just \u201cappear\u201d soft on enforcement, as the Daily Beast asserts \u2013 they are soft on enforcement. During the second night of the first round of presidential primary debates, almost all of the Democrats on stage indicated that they would support decriminalizing illegal immigration, and all 10 candidates raised their hands to affirm that they would provide taxpayer-funded health care to those who cross the border illegally. While experienced messaging gurus can sometimes work miracles with even the most extreme policy platforms, the radicalism of today\u2019s Democrat Party is truly beyond redemption. It doesn\u2019t help matters that the Democrats\u2019 track record of obstructing my father\u2019s immigration policies proves that their extremism is far from \u201ctheoretical,\u201d to use Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s terminology. Ever since my father was inaugurated, the Democrats have done everything in their power to derail his immigration policies, even insisting that the ongoing humanitarian and national security catastrophe on the southern border is nothing but a \u201cmanufactured crisis.\u201d Time and time again, Democrats in Congress have blocked the president\u2019s efforts to fund the border wall, slandered our brave Border Patrol agents, ignored the fact that illegal immigration costs U.S. taxpayers a whopping $116 billion a year, and most importantly, disregarded the lives of the victims of violent crimes committed by illegal aliens. They even attempted to torpedo bipartisan legislation to provide more funding for detention centers by including poison pill provisions that would have made it nearly impossible for immigration authorities to properly detain illegal immigrants. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats will have to do far more than merely adjust their rhetoric if they want to be taken seriously on the illegal immigration issue. Judging from their behavior, though, it doesn\u2019t seem like the Democrats are inclined to start embracing common-sense immigration policies any time soon. Even the Democrats' mouthpieces in Washington know that they're losing the immigration war that they themselves started. But don't look to their messaging to find out why \u2013 people are recoiling from them because their open borders policies are anti-American and dangerous.
