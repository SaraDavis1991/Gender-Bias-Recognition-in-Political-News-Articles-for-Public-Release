On the roster: Welcome to the Thunderdome, Elizabeth Warren - Pelosi still not biting on impeachment vote - Gallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office - Bevin recovers in Kentucky poll - Sláinte, Mr. Bradley


WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME, ELIZABETH WARREN
WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose steady stream of plans have propelled her to the top of the Democratic presidential field, came under sustained attack for the first time during a raucous primary debate here Tuesday that revealed Democrats’ ongoing public struggle to define their beliefs and choose a standard-bearer to take on President Trump. Warren (Mass.) faced direct challenges from several of the 11 other candidates onstage, who took her on over her policies, her fitness to serve as commander in chief and her willingness to question the motives of Democrats who support less transformational ideas. … The focus on Warren deflected attention from others facing scrutiny entering Tuesday’s debate, which was hosted by CNN and the New York Times. Former vice president Joe Biden went for long stretches without surfacing… Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, showed no signs of lingering health trouble.”

Klobuchar, Buttigieg shone through - National Review: “The October Democratic presidential-primary debate finally brought a genuine surprise, in that a pair of second-tier candidates who were in danger of being forgotten woke up, smelled the coffee, and brought their A-games: Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. Considering how other second-tier candidates have turned in good performances in past months and seen little movement in the polls, this may not be a turning point in the race for either candidate. But in a way-too-long, often-boring debate that was stuck in the middle of an otherwise jam-packed news environment, Klobuchar and Buttigieg managed to stand out.”

Sanders and Warren have deep pockets as Biden burns cash - AP: “Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don’t just lead the Democratic presidential primary in fundraising. They’ve stockpiled millions more than their rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who burned through money at a fast clip over the past three months while posting an anemic fundraising haul. Sanders held $33.7 million cash on hand on his third-quarter fundraising report. Warren had $25.7 million during the same period, while South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg came next $23.3 million. Biden, meanwhile, held just $8.9 million, a small fraction of what his leading rivals have at their disposal. With the first votes of the Democratic contest just months away, the candidates are entering a critical and expensive period when having an ample supply of cash can make or break a campaign. Biden’s total raises questions about his durability as a front-runner.”

Squad to endorse Sanders - Fox News: “Three members of the so-called ‘Squad’ of far-left freshman members of Congress are lining up behind Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a ‘Bernie’s Back’ rally designed to generate excitement for the senator’s campaign following his recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed. In addition, CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event. … The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren…”

Steyer spending stupendous - WSJ: “Billionaire Tom Steyer appeared on the Democratic presidential debate stage for the first time Tuesday night, but voters in early states have already seen him on TV thousands of times. Mr. Steyer, who new federal filings show has poured nearly $48 million of his own money into his long-shot bid, is dominating television screens in the first four states that will hold nominating contests early next year. Since entering the race in July, Mr. Steyer has spent more than $26 million on TV ads, airing more than 53,000 spots in markets that reach Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada voters, data from ad-tracking firm Kantar/CMAG shows. All told, that is more than six times as many as the rest of the Democratic field combined.”

THE RULEBOOK: DEMOCRACY AND CHILL 

“Where the whole power of the government is in the hands of the people, there is the less pretense for the use of violent remedies in partial or occasional distempers of the State.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 21

TIME OUT: AN INVENTOR’S SLAP SHOT
Smithsonian: “Invented by Frank Zamboni, the eponymous ice-clearing machine celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. He applied for his first U.S. patent in 1949, for this innovative idea that totally transformed winter sports by giving chopped-up ice surfaces a fresh-frozen smoothness in a matter of minutes. ‘At the time, he was just trying to address a need of his,’ says Frank Zamboni, the inventor’s grandson and now president of the Zamboni Company. ‘He saw a need for the ice rink he owned with his brother and cousins… Instead of taking 1 1/2 hours to clean the ice, that was time somebody could be paying to skate on it.’ Contrary to popular belief, the Zamboni machine was not invented in Canada—the place of snow and ice—but in Southern California—the land of sun and fun. … As time went on, he saw a need to quickly clean the ice, so he started improvising with war-surplus equipment.”

PELOSI STILL NOT BITING ON IMPEACHMENT VOTE
Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders will hold off on a full House vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. Democratic leadership sources caution, however, that the decision could be ‘reassessed at some point.’ The move came amid opposition from key chairmen and members of leadership, as well as a number of centrist Democrats facing tough reelection bids. Trump, White House officials and Republicans on Capitol Hill have seized on the absence of such a vote as an unacceptable break with House precedent and have vowed to resist what they describe as an illegitimate probe. But Democrats defended their current impeachment process, which has multiple House committees interviewing witnesses in private and gathering evidence related to allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pressured Ukrainian officials to begin an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son — potentially at the risk of losing U.S. military aid.”

Gallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office - Gallup: “Public opinion on whether Trump should be impeached remains mixed, but Americans now lean slightly more in favor of impeachment and removal from office compared with where they stood in June. Currently, 52% say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46% say he should not be. This is roughly the opposite of what Gallup found in June when asked in the context of special counselor Robert Mueller's investigation.”

Staffers fear White House seeking scapegoat on Ukraine call - NYT: “President Trump has for weeks sought to unmask the whistle-blower who shed light on his Ukraine dealings. But instead aides have fixated on one another: Advisers began a fact-finding review that some fear is a hunt for a scapegoat, according to White House aides and other people familiar with it. Even as the impeachment inquiry intensifies in Congress, White House lawyers are leading their own review, the people said. They are seeking to understand White House officials’ actions around Mr. Trump’s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which is central to the whistle-blower’s allegation that Mr. Trump abused his power. The lawyers’ inquiry centers on why one of their colleagues, the deputy White House counsel John A. Eisenberg, placed a rough transcript of the call in a computer system typically reserved for the country’s most closely guarded secrets. Mr. Trump later directed that a reconstructed transcript be released amid intensifying scrutiny from House Democrats.”

Mulvaney emerges as key figure in impeachment probe - WaPo: “In late May, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney organized a meeting that stripped control of the country’s relationship with Ukraine from those who had the most expertise at the National Security Council and the State Department. Instead, Mulvaney put an unlikely trio in charge of managing the U.S.-Ukraine account amid worrisome signs of a new priority, congressional officials said Tuesday: pressuring the fledgling government in Kiev to deliver material that would be politically valuable to President Trump. The work of those ‘three amigos,’ as they came to call themselves — diplomats Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker, plus Energy Secretary Rick Perry — has come to light in recent days through newly disclosed text messages and the testimony of government witnesses appearing before an impeachment inquiry in Congress.”

BEVIN RECOVERS IN KENTUCKY POLL
WYMT: “The Mason-Dixon Kentucky Poll was released early Wednesday morning, and the results are interesting. The poll shows that statewide, 46 percent of likely voters support Republican Governor Matt Bevin, while 46 percent back Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear. At the beginning of the year, Beshear held a 48 percent-40 percent lead over Bevin, but the incumbent has pulled into a tie with his challenger. One percent of respondents voted for Libertarian nominee John Hicks, while seven percent were undecided. The poll also shows Bevin's GOP support grew from 67 percent in December to 77 percent. He is pulling in 22 percent of Democrat respondents for the cross-over vote, while Beshear is drawing 15 percent from Republicans. Among the Mason-Dixon poll participants, Bevin led among men, older voters and rural voters. … The poll credits some of Bevin's resurgence to President Donald Trump's popularity in Kentucky and resistance to his impeachment.”

Second debate was heavy with personal attacks - Louisville Courier Journal: “Republican incumbent Matt Bevin and Democratic challenger Andy Beshear had their ugliest public exchange Tuesday at the second gubernatorial debate of the fall campaign. Throughout the discussion, hosted before a raucous crowd of supporters on the University of Kentucky campus, the two rivals called each other liars and regularly interrupted one another as they were peppered with policy questions. When moderators asked about ways they would encourage students to pursue a career in public education, including the state's colleges and universities, the conversation took a turn into the gutter. … The high stakes debate touched on health care, pension reform, medical marijuana and supporting out-of-work coal miners. But it underscored how Kentucky's race for governor this year is defined by Bevin and Beshear's enmity as much as their deep differences on tackling the state's woes.”

AUDIBLE: THANKS?

“[Amy Klobuchar] had some smart answers. I’m starting not to care that she is brutal to her staff.” – Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, writing in Politico about the Democrats’ debate.  

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If Trump is impeached and the Senate is mad at him, votes him out, then the GOP could have a primary too. That would take up a lot of news from the Democrats. I think we need a law for 6 months of elections, period.” – Karen Morrow, Tampa, Fla.


[Ed. note: It would be a comfort to have such constraints, it’s true. But our Constitution just wouldn’t allow for it. The government can’t tell people when they can talk about issues, therefore there’s no way to keep candidates from campaigning and reporters from reporting. I’m increasingly in favor, though, of doing away with primary elections. Our 40-year experiment with them has been a miserable bust and has unnecessarily prolonged our election calendars. Bring back conventions and spare the American people!]


“I have pretty much come to the opinion that two things will happen…one, the 2020 election is not going to be over on election night (owing to huge court battles to follow many very close races) and…two, at some point our Agitator-in-Chief is going to leave office of his own volition…having become tired of the battle and wanting to go back to his business dealings and such. What say youse (that’s a Michigan (born & raised there) UP term)?” – Rick Randell, Bradenton, Fla.


[Ed. note: I say that I know better not to say, Mr. Randell! I think there are lots of potential scenarios for 2020 that could still be in the offing. We may yet see a landslide or even, dare I say, a political realignment. As for Trump leaving early, it’s pretty hard for me to fathom. I doubt he’d give his enemies the pleasure.]


“I miss Chris’ input during events like the debates on Twitter. I understand why he left, and it is best for his happiness. But there were so many Whhhooo Doogie moments last night, I would have loved watching it with him. But since I have found Fox Nation I can see his more candid takes on the events of the day. I just cannot interact with my clever comments! I would love to have him join The Dispatch so he could participate in the discussion groups. I will send them a note to suggest his inclusion! Thank you for being so glorious. (Sorry about the Cardinals, but Charles is happy!)” – Polly Barrett, Waco, Texas

SLÁINTE, MR. BRADLEY
HuffPo: “A man in Dublin, Ireland, decided to inject a little humor into his funeral Saturday by playing a prank on his loved ones. Shay Bradley, a Defense Forces veteran who died Oct. 8 ‘after a long illness bravely borne’ according to his obituary, shocked then delighted funeralgoers when they suddenly heard his voice shouting from his coffin as it was being lowered into the ground. ‘Hello? Hello. Hello? Let me out!’ stunned attendees heard in a prerecorded message that also included ‘knocking’ against the coffin’s lid. … Those at the funeral can be seen giggling and wiping away tears as Bradley’s voice begins to sing: ‘Hello again, hello. Hello, I just called to say goodbye.’ His daughter Andrea Bradley told HuffPost that her father recorded the audio about a year ago — and that no one really knew about it other than her brother Jonathan and her nephew, Ben. Two days before Shay Bradley’s funeral, Jonathan Bradley decided to tell his mom and the rest of his siblings about the prank. He told them that playing the audio at the funeral was his dad’s dying wish.”

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“My non-baseball friends are forever puzzled by my devotion to the game. I agree entirely with them about the irrationality of fandom. … It’s ridiculous. Yet when the hometown Washington Nationals win, my mood brightens. Can’t help it.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on April 21, 2016.

On the roster: Elizabeth Warren, zombie candidate - Ducey holds all the cards on McCain seat - Cohen calls out Trump - House schedule is ‘subject to change’ - Finally, an interception even the Jets can make


ELIZABETH WARREN, ZOMBIE CANDIDATE 

At this point, it feels a bit like piling on, but can we just say: Puh-leeze, Elizabeth Warren. 


The Massachusetts senator, who is whiter than a Starbucks kiosk at a Dave Matthews Band concert, delivered the fall-semester commencement address at the historically black Morgan State University in Baltimore. 


“I’m not a person of color,” she helpfully observed. “And I haven’t lived your life or experienced anything like the subtle prejudice, or more overt harm, that you may have experienced just because of the color of your skin.”


The joke here is that Warren did once present herself as a person of color back when it was advantageous for her to do so in the nerd-eat-nerd world of big-time academia. 


When she was called out for this “Pow-Wow Chow” stuff, she initially blew it off. Then when Donald Trump weaponized the taunt in a deadly effective way, Warren sought to double down, releasing a DNA report that said she was, in fact, part Native American. 


This is where it gets really funny. Having failed to do its homework, her campaign ended up bragging about a portion of native blood in which only the most committed bigot could be interested. She had less Indian ancestry than the average white American.


*sad trombone*


Tribal leaders were furious, Republicans were splitting their sides with laughter and Democrats concerned for their 2020 chances were watching through latticed fingers at the implosion. 


Now, with all of the subtlety and nuance of Clark Griswold’s Christmas display, Warren is sucking up to minority voters knowing as she does that like Bernie Sanders in 2016 and several white progressives in 2018 primaries that the readership of The Nation is not a sufficient base in a party that is substantially and increasingly not white. 


In a party enamored with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley and Stacey Abrams, Warren looks hopelessly out of step. Democrats may very well choose a person of color as their 2020 nominee, but it’s hard to imagine that they would pick a white person with racial baggage. (Sorry, Mike Bloomberg.)


Now, Warren has seen her stock tumble so far that she may one day be in good shape for a “comeback kid” narrative, but not yet. And that really is the problem for Democrats: Their field will be full of zombies. 


Warren, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, former Attorney General Eric Holder, Sanders and others have enough resources and can garner enough media attention to run for a long, long time. 


Even now a phalanx of Democratic staffers fresh from the 2018 field of battle are surging into early states for these candidates. There’s plenty of money and a field so large no one can really be discredited so early. If Beto O’Rourke is a thing – and he is – who is to tell a sitting senator, governor or billionaire former mayor of New York they don’t have a chance? 


But as the groan-inducing efforts to prop up Warren’s floundering campaign illustrates, this all comes at a cost.


In 2012 Republicans were quite indulgent with themselves when it came to choosing a nominee, pausing over several odd lots, sometimes more than once, before grudgingly, half-heartedly accepting Mitt Romney as their man. This happened for a lot of reasons, most of all a misunderstanding among GOP voters about how hard it would be to defeat and incumbent president.


But it was also made worse by billionaire Republican donors and the consultants that milked them propping up doomed candidates and generally avoiding the hard arithmetic of primary politics. 


Republicans should not kid themselves. Few incumbent presidents have faced the challenges that Trump does. George W. Bush had a pretty hard pull in 2004, but you’d probably have to go back to his dad to find an incumbent with a to-do box as full as Trump’s. 


But he is nowhere near as vulnerable as Democrats would like to think. He will be a tough out and if the Blue Team has a bunch of zombies roaming around snacking on the brains of an engaged but uncertain electorate, it will cost them.

THE RULEBOOK: ACTION HERO 

“Those politicians and statesmen who have been the most celebrated for the soundness of their principles and for the justice of their views, have declared in favor of a single Executive and a numerous legislature. They have with great propriety, considered energy as the most necessary qualification of the former, and have regarded this as most applicable to power in a single hand…” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 70

TIME OUT: ‘PIOUS, JUST, HUMANE, TEMPERATE AND SINCERE’ 

On this day in 1799, the father of our country, George Washington, died at age 67 from a throat infection and the misinformed medical treatment of his time. Mount Vernon: “At five in the afternoon [he] sat up from bed, dressed, and walked over to his chair. He returned to bed within thirty minutes. [Longtime friend and family physician James Craik] went to him and Washington said, ‘Doctor, I die hard; but I am not afraid to go; I believed from my first attack that I should not survive it; my breath can not last long.’ … At ten at night [he] spoke, requesting to be ‘decently buried’ and to ‘not let my body be put into the Vault in less than three days after I am dead.’ … He was surrounded by people who were close to him including his wife who sat at the foot of the bed, his friends Dr. Craik and Tobias Lear, housemaids Caroline, Molly, and Charlotte, and his valet Christopher Sheels who stood in the room throughout the day. … On December 18, 1799 a solemn funeral was held at Mount Vernon.”

DUCEY HOLDS ALL THE CARDS ON MCCAIN SEAT 
Politico: “Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) will resign at the end of this year, forcing Republican Gov. Doug Ducey to appoint a new replacement to the late Sen. John McCain's seat ahead of a 2020 special election to fill the last two years of McCain's term. Kyl sent Ducey a letter Wednesday announcing his resignation effective at the end of this month. ‘When I accepted your appointment, I agreed to complete the work of the 115th Congress and then reevaluate continuing to serve,’ Kyl wrote. ‘I have concluded that it would be best if I resign so that your new appointee can begin the new term with all other Senators in January 2018 and can serve a full two (potentially four) years.’ Ducey's office said in a statement that the governor will appoint another replacement in the near future. Two prospects are GOP Rep. Martha McSally, who lost a campaign for Arizona's other Senate seat earlier this year, and Kirk Adams, Ducey's former chief of staff and a former speaker of the Arizona House.” 

And he isn’t sold on McSally - WaPo: “Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has lost enthusiasm for appointing Rep. Martha McSally, a fellow Republican, to the Senate in recent weeks even as Republican leaders in Washington have championed her. … But her stock has fallen in the eyes of the governor, according to two people familiar with his thinking, as Ducey approaches one of the most significant decisions of his political career. Ducey’s choice would affect not only the future of the Senate but the 2020 elections in an increasingly competitive battleground state. It could also impact his relationship with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a McSally advocate, as well as other party leaders who want to see more Republican women in Congress. There are several reasons McSally’s chances have faded, according to the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss private conversations. One is a post-election memo her campaign strategists provided to The Washington Post last month, which attributed her defeat in November to external factors. Among them… There are also concerns about McSally’s standing among Republican donors.”

COHEN CALLS OUT TRUMP 
NPR: “Michael Cohen, President Trump's onetime lawyer and fixer, says his former boss knew it was wrong to order hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who allege they had affairs with Trump — but he directed Cohen to do it anyway to help his election chances. Cohen also said in an interview with ABC News aired Friday that the president's repeated assertions that Cohen is lying about the payments and other aspects of his work for Trump were false. ‘He knows the truth. I know the truth. Others know the truth,’ Cohen said. ‘The man doesn't tell the truth. And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds.’ Cohen pleaded guilty to financial crimes, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. His ABC interview appeared less than 48 hours after a federal judge in Manhattan sentenced him to three years in prison and imposed around $2 million in financial penalties. It appears to be part of an effort by Cohen to rehabilitate his reputation, which is in tatters and disparaged by people on both sides of the political spectrum.”

Giuliani not concerned about Cohen’s allegations - Market Watch: “Rudy Giuliani bashed President Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, on Friday, after Cohen said in a televised interview that Trump had directed him to make hush-money payments during the 2016 presidential campaign. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the former New York mayor, now a lawyer for Trump, called Cohen’s allegations ‘much ado about nothing’ and sought to minimize Cohen’s admitted violation of campaign-finance law. ‘Whether they talked about it or not, their talking about it can’t make it a crime,’ Giuliani said about the hush-money payments. … In discussing Cohen’s admission, Giuliani told the Journal: ‘It’s campaign finance, my God.’ ‘Everybody pays a fine to the [Federal Election Commission] that is in politics. You can’t follow all the rules.’ The payments were found to be in violation of campaign-finance laws, since they were made in an attempt to influence the election. Giuliani also made comments to the Daily Beast about the violations, saying ‘nobody got killed, nobody got robbed.’”

HOUSE SCHEDULE IS ‘SUBJECT TO CHANGE’
Roll Call: “House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy stated the obvious on Thursday when he noted that the chamber’s schedule for next week remains ‘fluid and subject to change.’ Outside of the big remaining item of business — a deal to extend government funding for nine departments and assorted agencies amid the congressional standoff with President Donald Trump over funding for a border wall — there is a dwindling list of legislative business for the chamber to attend to before the adjourning of the 115th Congress. The House conducted its final vote of the week early Thursday and as McCarthy and Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., assembled on the floor to discuss the week ahead, the schedule McCarthy laid out reflected the uncertainty of when a spending deal might be considered, as well as the lack of a definitive plan on considering anything else.”

Pelosi vs. Hoyer is another fight to watch - NYT: “In her quest to become speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California appears ready once again to sacrifice the higher ambitions of her No. 2, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, and Mr. Hoyer is not shy about expressing his objections. ‘She’s not negotiating for me,’ he snapped the other day, referring to Ms. Pelosi’s deal with a group of House Democratic rebels to impose term limits on the leadership — and not just herself — of four years. As Democrats prepare to assume control of the House, the Pelosi-Hoyer frenemies dynamic, long a subject of intrigue in the Capitol, is growing ever more complex. The friction goes back decades. The last time Democrats took power from Republicans, in 2006, Ms. Pelosi backed then-Representative John P. Murtha in his effort to oust Mr. Hoyer from the majority leader’s slot. The putsch failed spectacularly, but she’s ready to handcuff him again with a deal on term limits that, if approved, would most likely usher both lawmakers from their leadership suites by early 2023, along with the No. 3 Democrat, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina.”

WALKER SIGNS LEGACY BILL STICKING IT TO DEMS
AP: “Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker signed a sweeping package of Republican-written legislation Friday that restricts early voting and weakens the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general, brushing aside complaints that he is enabling a brazen power grab and ignoring the will of voters. Walker signed the bills just 24 days before he leaves office during an event at a state office building in Green Bay, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) from his Capitol office that has frequently been a target for protesters. The Republican governor and one-time GOP presidential candidate downplayed bipartisan criticism that they amount to a power grab that will stain his legacy. Speaking for 20 minutes and using charts to make his points, Walker detailed all of the governor’s powers, including a strong veto authority, that will not change while defending the measures he signed as improving transparency, stability and accountability.”

FINALLY, AN INTERCEPTION EVEN THE JETS CAN MAKE
WPVI: “An armored truck spilled cash on a New Jersey highway Thursday, leading to two crashes as drivers ‘went a little bit crazy,’ stopping their cars and scrambling to grab the swirling money. The frenzy happened during morning rush hour in East Rutherford, near MetLife Stadium, where the New York Giants and New York Jets play. In online videos, a man in uniform is seen running through traffic trying to collect money, while others exited their cars to do the same. … A Brink's truck idled in the right shoulder with its lights flashing as the bills blew around the highway. One video showed the bashed-in front end of a sedan as traffic crawled through the blizzard of bills. Police said the chaos led to two crashes, though it's unclear whether anyone was injured. … Police said they don't know how much money spilled.”

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“If you get in a car to go to a certain place in the middle of the night to pick up stolen goods, and it turns out the stolen goods don't show up but the cops show up, I think you're going to have a very weak story saying ‘I got swindled here.’” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) on “The Story with Martha MacCallum” on July 11, 2017.
