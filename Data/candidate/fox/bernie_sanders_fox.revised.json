      "content": " Monday night Fox News hosted a town hall with Bernie Sanders. I wasn't invited.\u00a0 So I guess I was out of town. But if I had an hour with our leading pre-eminent socialist, here's what I'd ask him: 1. If you had to teach a course on Marxism/Leninism, how would you address the 100 million-plus dead left behind?\u00a0\u00a0 What caused it, beyond\u00a0\"administrative error?\" 2. Socialists bring up small successes in Europe without mentioning that economic growth is miserable compared to the U.S. Why hide that? SANDERS NABS TOP SPOT IN NEW DEMS POLL AS PETE BUTTIGIEG GAINS MOMENTUM 3. You live in the greatest economic system in history. Yet, you see in socialism \u2013 a system rejected by nearly every nation that has tried it \u2013 as better. Given the previous questions: why? 4. Do you see equality of opportunity and outcome as the same?\u00a0Should there have been a cap on the book royalties which made you a millionaire?\u00a0Should you only have one home instead of three? Also, can you give an example of economic inequality that exists after you factor in age, experience and education? Older people tend to have higher incomes and more wealth.\u00a0You are older and richer than most.\u00a0Aren't you proof of economic mobility,\u00a0not inequality? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP 5. Since you became a millionaire, you've trained your sights on billionaires. There are 585 of them in the U.S. If we took all their money, would our problems be solved? 6.\u00a0 It's been said that if you aren't a liberal when you're young you have no heart, but if you aren't a conservative when you're old you have no brain.

      "content": " Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has pledged to American workers that he would institute a $15-per-hour minimum wage if he wins the White House in 2020. But unionized workers on Sanders\u2019 own campaign say they wish he would start now -- by paying a higher wage to them. According to a report, members of Sanders\u2019 staff have been using the senator's\u00a0own campaign rhetoric against him as they try to wrestle more pay from the self-described democratic socialist. BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HIS $40 TRILLION MEDICARE-FOR-ALL PLAN WOULD HELP US SAVE MONEY In a letter to Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir, the campaign staffers claim they \u201ccannot be expected to build the largest grassroots organizing program in American history while making poverty wages,\u201d the Washington Post reported. \u201cGiven our campaign\u2019s commitment to fighting for a living wage of at least $15.00 an hour,\u201d the letter continues, \u201cwe believe it is only fair that the campaign would carry through this commitment to its own field team.\u201d According to the Post, field organizers claim that their long hours working on behalf of Sanders drop their actual pay to about $13 per hour. \u201cMany field staffers are barely managing to survive financially,\u201d the union letter says, \u201cwhich is severely impacting our team\u2019s productivity and morale. Some field organizers have already left the campaign as a result.\u201d But when contacted by the Post on Thursday, Shakir seemed to paint a different picture. \u201cWe know our campaign offers wages and benefits competitive with other campaigns, as is shown by the latest fundraising reports,\u201d Shakir said in a statement, according to the Post. \u201cEvery member of the campaign, from the candidate on down, joined this movement in order to defeat Donald Trump and transform America. Bernie Sanders is the most pro-worker and pro-labor candidate running for president.\u201d As for Sanders himself, the Post said it was unclear whether the candidate was aware of the grievances among his campaign staff. The Post report surfaced on the same day that the Democrat-controlled House voted in favor of a bill to gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, unchanged since 2009. The situation in the Sanders campaign seems a far cry from March, when Sanders\u2019 campaign proudly announced that its employees had chosen to be represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400. In May, the campaign ratified a union contract with the workers, making it the first presidential campaign in history to do so. At the time, the campaign touted \"unprecedented standards for campaign workers,\" including pay transparency, a defined wage scale, access to mental health care coverage, an anti-discrimination policy that protects immigrant and transgender staff members, and a \"pro-worker grievance and arbitration process.\u201d Meanwhile, President Trump has offered a different perspective on conditions facing U.S. workers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP During a campaign rally in Greenville, N.C., earlier this week, the president said 6 million new jobs had been created in the U.S. since he was elected and the nation\u2019s unemployment rate of 3.7 percent was at its lowest point in decades. Republican leaders have said a minimum wage hike would be \u201cdevastating\u201d for middle-class families, citing research from the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO report found that the Democrats\u2019 bill would boost wages for about 17 million people \u2013 but it would also reduce business income, raise consumer prices and reduce the nation\u2019s output. Overall, the CBO said the move would reduce real family income by about $9 billion in 2025 \u2013 or 0.1 percent.

      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., proudly announced this year that his presidential campaign would be the first in history to have a unionized workforce. Well, he just became the first presidential candidate in history to face a labor revolt from his unionized workforce. The Sanders campaign workers union, United Food & Commercial Workers Local 400, complained that field organizers are \"making poverty wages\" and that \"many field staffers are barely managing to survive financially.\" Because field organizers are working 60 hours a week, according to the union, their annual salary of $36,000 works out to $13 an hour -- well below the $15-an-hour federal minimum wage Sanders has called for. BERNIE SANDERS' UNIONIZED 2020 STAFFERS TO RECEIVE PAY RAISE It gets worse. When the Sanders campaign offered to raise salaries to that level, the union rejected the offer. Why? Because \"the raise would have elevated field staff to a pay level responsible for paying more of their own health-care costs.\" It turns out that Sanders pays only 85 percent of health care premiums for campaign staff making more than $36,000 \u2013 despite campaigning on a promise of free health care for all with \"no premiums, no deductibles, no co-payments, no out-of-pocket expenses.\" So, what was Sanders's solution? First, he cut the hours of his field staffers from 60 to about 43 a week -- which meant the campaign could say it was paying $15 an hour without actually increasing field organizers' pay. Then on Monday, his campaign finally gave in and agreed to raise salaries to $42,000, preserve full health premium coverage and limit workers' hours to 50 per week. During the dispute, Sanders's campaign defended its policies, declaring: \"We know our campaign offers wages and benefits competitive with other campaigns.\" Well, McDonald's offers wages competitive with other fast-food chains, but that has not been good enough for Sanders. He has\u00a0marched with McDonald's workers, and attended Walmart shareholder meetings, to demand they be more generous with their workforces. How could he demand those companies provide pay and benefits that he was resisting giving his own employees? Now the union has forced Sanders to capitulate on wages and health care. But why stop there? The Sanders union seems to be suffering from a lack of imagination. If union organizers really want to hold Sanders to his own standards, then a $15 minimum wage and premium-free health care should be only the beginning. Sanders has promised to cover the cost of prescription drugs and make sure \"no one in America pays over $200 a year for the medicine they need.\" He has promised to pay for \"universal childcare and pre-kindergarten.\" He has promised free college, because \"you are not truly free when the vast majority of good-paying jobs require a degree that requires taking out tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt to obtain.\" Sanders has promised to \"free generations of Americans from the outrageous burden of student loans by canceling all existing student debt.\" Is he setting an example by providing all these benefits to workers on his campaign? Of course not. Because if he did, his campaign would quickly run out of cash. Ah, but there's the rub. As former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously put it, \"the trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money.\" A political campaign literally runs on other people's money. It is bare-bones operation, in which staffers choose to work ridiculous hours for low pay, and rely on donations from supporters to get the candidate's message out. In Sanders's case, the majority of his donations come from small donors \u2013 ordinary Americans who are sacrificing their hard-earned money to help get him elected, not to fund social welfare for political operatives. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Every dollar his campaign spends on higher pay and free stuff for campaign workers is a dollar not spent on campaign ads in Iowa and New Hampshire. And if his campaign can't get those ads on the air, then Sanders will lose \u2013 and his entire team will lose their jobs, their benefits and their chances of a cushy White House job. Then they won't ever get access to the United States Treasury and the chance to really\u00a0spend other people's money. So, we should all be grateful to the UFCW Local 400 for pulling more Sanders campaign money off the airwaves and into the pockets of Sanders's field workers, while limiting the hours they can work to spread his socialist message. They've done the country a great service. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MARC THIESSEN",

Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry\u2019s, unveiled a new Bernie-Sanders-inspired flavor of ice cream. While it won\u2019t be an official Ben and Jerry\u2019s flavor, the creamy dessert was created in Ben\u2019s kitchen with the help of Jerry Greenfield (aka Jerry from Ben & Jerry\u2019s). Being released under the \u201cBen\u2019s Best\u201d banner, Bernie\u2019s Back is a hot cinnamon ice cream with a large chocolate disc on the top and a stiff butter toffee \u201cbackbone\u201d running down the middle. Only 40 pints are being made and fans will have to sign up on Sanders\u2019 website for a chance to win one of the limited items. Each pint will be signed by Ben Cohen. According to the website, each aspect of the dish represents part of Sanders\u2019 message. The chocolate disc is a reference to the \u201cwealth that has risen to the top 1%,\u201d while the toffee \u201cbackbone\u201d is meant to show Sanders\u2019 \u201csteadfast determination to unrig\u201d the economy.

This isn\u2019t the first time Sanders has been turned into an ice cream flavor. In 2016, Ben\u2019s Best released \u201cBernie\u2019s Yearnings,\u201d which similarly featured a solid chocolate disc at the top. That time, however, fans were treated to mint ice cream once they broke through.

The Vermont senator's proposal to \"ban the use of facial recognition software for policing\" is part of his broader criminal justice reform agenda. Facial recognition technology has drawn the ire of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, some of whom have called for a \"time out\" on its development. However, that seems unlikely, since the technology is already being used in some form or another in dozens of U.S. cities \u2014\u00a0as this interactive map details. HATE SPEECH ALGORITHMS BIASED AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE, RESEARCHERS FIND The activist group responsible for the map, Fight for the Future, is calling for a total federal ban on the technology.\u00a0Sanders is the first 2020 presidential candidate to do so. \"The rapid spread of facial recognition surveillance is one of the most urgent threats to our basic freedom and human rights today. Every single 2020 candidate should be calling for a ban on this invasive, biased and dangerous technology,\" said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, in a statement shared with Fox News. Several American cities, including Oakland and San Francisco in California, along with Somverville, Mass., have voted to ban the municipal use of facial recognition technology. Berkeley, Calif. and Cambridge, Mass. are also considering bans on the controversial technology. Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker expressed strong reservations about the technology's potential ability to fuel racial bias in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission last September. WARREN WON'T SUPPORT SANDERS WASHINGTON POST-BIAS CLAIMS \"Banning facial recognition is not a radical idea. It's common sense. Allowing government agencies to build a face-scanning panopticon with no oversight or accountability is reckless and puts people in danger,\" Greer said.

Bernie Sanders\u2019 2020 presidential campaign comes word that the candidate\u2019s Iowa political director has departed as well. According to reports, a Sanders aide on Wednesday confirmed that Jess Mazour, who was named Sanders\u2019 Iowa director in March, was let go from the campaign in recent weeks. The aide confirmed the departure on condition of anonymity because the aide wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss personnel matters, The Associated Press reported. SANDERS SHAKES UP CAMPAIGN LEADERSHIP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE Prior to joining the sanders campaign, Mazour was an organizer for the progressive group Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement. The Washington Post was first to report that she had left the campaign. On Sunday, the Sanders campaign announced changes to its New Hampshire leadership after backers of the campaign expressed concern that the independent U.S. senator from neighboring Vermont could lose the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary early next year. The campaign announced that Shannon Jackson, who ran Sanders\u2019 Senate reelection campaign in Vermont in 2018, would take over New Hampshire leadersip duties from Joe Caiazzo, who was transferred to Sanders\u2019 operation in Massachusetts, according to the Washington Times. The Caiazzo-Jackson switch came one day after the Sanders campaign parted ways with senior New Hampshire adviser Kurt Ehrenberg. The changes in the Sanders campaign coincide with the loss of a key endorsement for Sanders to rival 2020 progressive candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who this week attracted the backing of the Working Families Party -- a group that had supported Sanders in 2016. \u201cSeeing the campaign not be able to outshine Warren with WFP progressives doesn\u2019t have me questioning WFP\u2019s process,\u201d Rafael Shimunov, a 2016 Sanders volunteer and past national creative director for WFP told Politico. \u201cIt has me questioning where the Bernie campaign could have done better, because I want to make sure the strongest candidate unmasks Biden and unseats Trump.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A Fox News Poll released Wednesday shows that Warren has pulled virtually even with Sanders in second place behind former Vice President Joe Biden, with Sanders attracting support from 18 percent of respondents, Warren 16 percent, and Biden leading with 29 percent.

Elizabeth Warren\u2019s surge in the Democratic primary with progressive voters \u2013 is seeking to cut into the support of his rival by dismissing her as a \u201ccapitalist.\u201d \u201cThere are differences between Elizabeth and myself,\u201d Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cElizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I\u2019m not.\u201d BILLIONAIRES COULD FACE UP TO 97.5 PERCENT TAX RATES UNDER SANDERS\u2019 PLAN: ECONOMISTS The comments come\u00a0amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism.\u00a0It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism. Last year,\u00a0when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren\u00a0reportedly said, \"I am a capitalist to my bones.\" Sanders explained he is not a capitalist\u00a0because he\u00a0\"will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.\u201d A Gallup poll this year\u00a0found that 43 percent of Americans think socialism would be a good thing for the United States, while 51 percent say it would be a bad thing. Gallup noted that in 1942, a Roper/Fortune survey that found 40 percent of Americans described socialism as a bad thing while only 25 percent called it a good thing. The polling is fresh evidence that attitudes toward socialism are changing, amid the popularity in the Democratic Party of Democratic socialists like Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who pushes policies like \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d and the Green New Deal. Meanwhile, two economists at the\u00a0University of California, Berkeley, claim that billionaires could face a 97.5 percent average effective tax rate under\u00a0Sanders'\u00a0plan, which would easily thump other Democrats running for president in 2020. Emmanuel Saez, one of the professors, told\u00a0Bloomberg\u00a0that \u201cwith the wealth tax, you get directly at the stock instead of hitting the flow of income, making it a\u00a0much more powerful de-concentration tool than income taxes.\"\u00a0The report pointed out that Sanders has said that the number of billionaires in the U.S. would be cut in half within 15 years under the plan. The plan unveiled by Sanders seeks a 1 percent\u00a0levy on households worth more than $32 million and proposes tax rates that would increase for wealthier people, up to 8 percent\u00a0for fortunes in excess of $10 billion. Sanders vowed to go further than\u00a0Warren and generate more than $4 trillion over the next decade, substantially reducing billionaires\u2019 fortunes. Billionaires would face a 62 percent average effective tax rate under Warren. Sanders\u2019 plan goes further because it starts on fortunes worth less, kicking in at $32 million. Warren also proposes increasing the wealth tax up to 3 percent\u00a0on any net worth of more than $1 billion, while Sanders\u2019 tax rates don\u2019t top out until 8 percent\u00a0for the richest households.

Sanders and take audience questions in the live broadcast from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. In America today, we have more wealth and income inequality than any other major country on Earth and it is worse now than at any other time since the 1920s. Unbelievably, while millions of American workers are forced to work two or three jobs to pay the bills and over half of our people live paycheck to paycheck, the three wealthiest families in our country now own more wealth than the bottom half of Americans \u2013 160 million people. BERNIE SANDERS HITS THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, REACHING OUT TO WORKING CLASS VOTERS Today, while hundreds of thousands of bright young people cannot afford to go to college and millions are struggling with high levels of student debt, the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 92 percent. Today, while CEOs of major corporations make over 300 times what their average workers earn, thousands of veterans sleep out on the street and 20 percent of senior citizens are trying to survive on a paltry $13,500 income or less. For 40 years, under Democratic and Republican administrations, we have seen a massive redistribution of wealth and income from the working class of this country to the top one percent.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, if the distribution of income remained what it was 40 years ago the average household in America would have about $11,000 more in income today. Do you want to know why the American people are angry?\u00a0Today, despite an explosion in technology and worker productivity, the average worker has seen his/her income go up by just 5 cents an hour over the last 43 years after adjusting for inflation. And, if we don\u2019t turn the economy around, economists predict that the younger generation will have an even a lower standard of living than their parents. This is not acceptable to me.\u00a0\u00a0We need an economy that expands the middle class and reduces poverty and not one that makes the very rich much richer. When Donald Trump ran for president he made a lot of promises to working families.\u00a0\u00a0He told them that he would protect their interests while standing up to the Establishment.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, he did not tell the truth. During his campaign, Trump\u00a0said\u00a0he would provide \"health insurance for everybody,\u201d but as president he has pushed to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw 32 million Americans off of the health insurance they have.\u00a0\u00a0His efforts would also end the protections that are currently in existence for pre-existing conditions and end the ability of people under 26 to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance plans.\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, while 34 million Americans currently have no health insurance and even more are under-insured with high deductibles and co-payments, a handful of health care CEOs paid themselves more than\u00a0$1 billion last year. In my view, at a time when we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other nation, we should not be throwing millions of Americans off of health care they have.\u00a0\u00a0Quite the contrary!\u00a0\u00a0We should join every other major country on earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right through a Medicare for All, single-payer program.\u00a0\u00a0Medicare today is a popular and effective health insurance program for seniors.\u00a0\u00a0Over a 4-year period it should be expanded and improved to cover every man, woman and child in the country.\u00a0\u00a0And when we do that we significantly reduce the cost of health care for the average American family. During his campaign, Trump said that he would stop the pharmaceutical companies from \u201cgetting away with murder.\u201d Well, that didn\u2019t happen.\u00a0\u00a0They\u2019re making more money than ever.\u00a0\u00a0During the first half of last year there were 96 drug price increases for every price cut.\u00a0\u00a0Today, in the United States, we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, while the top ten pharmaceutical companies made $69 billion in profits last year alone. Shockingly, one out of five Americans cannot afford to purchase the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe.\u00a0\u00a0That is insane. As president, I will implement legislation I have introduced which would lower prescription drug prices by 50 percent so Americans no longer pay any more for their medicine than the people of other countries. During his campaign, Trump promised he would not cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.\u00a0\u00a0But the budget he proposed in March would cut\u00a0$1.5 trillion from Medicaid, $845 billion from Medicare, and $25 billion from Social Security.\u00a0\u00a0As president, at a time when so many seniors and people with disabilities are struggling, I will not cut Social Security.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, legislation that I have introduced would expand Social Security benefits while extending its solvency for over 50 years. During his campaign, Trump\u00a0promised\u00a0that \u201cthe rich will not be gaining at all\u201d under his tax plan. But the reality is that the plan that he helped pass provides\u00a083 percent\u00a0of the benefits to the top one percent by the end of the decade. Further, as a result of his tax plan, major profitable corporations like Amazon, General Motors, Chevron, IBM and Eli Lilly and dozens of other major corporations paid zero in federal income taxes after making billions in profits.\u00a0\u00a0That is a regressive and unfair tax system that must not be allowed to continue. At a time when the very rich are getting much richer and when corporations are enjoying record-breaking profits, I believe that the wealthiest people in this country have got to start paying their fair share of taxes and that we must end the tax havens that exist in places like the Cayman Islands where corporations and the rich stash trillions of dollars to avoid paying their taxes. During his campaign, Trump\u00a0promised\u00a0that he would substantially reduce the trade deficit, prevent the outsourcing of American jobs and protect good-paying jobs here at home. However, since Trump has been president the trade deficit in goods has hit a\u00a0record high\u00a0of $891 billion and his own Labor Department says that 185,000 American jobs have been shipped overseas under his watch. He has also expanded the tax cut that rewards companies for replacing American workers with robots; created new tax incentives for his corporate allies to shift jobs overseas; and given out\u00a0$50 billion\u00a0in government contracts to companies that are offshoring jobs. We are living in a pivotal moment in American history.\u00a0\u00a0Our goal must be to create good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, not give huge tax breaks to people who don\u2019t need them.\u00a0\u00a0Our job must be to invest in public education and combat climate change, not spend trillions on never ending wars. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Our job must be to bring all Americans together \u2013 black, white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, native born and immigrant \u2013 and not allow ourselves to be divided up. Together, we can and must create an economy and government that works for all Americans and not just the 1 percent.",
