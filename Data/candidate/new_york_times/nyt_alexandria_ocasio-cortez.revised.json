      "content": " Two police officers in Gretna, La., were fired on Monday, four days after one of them referred to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a \u201cvile idiot\u201d on social media and suggested that she should be shot. Chief Arthur Lawson of the Gretna Police Department announced the terminations, saying that Charles Rispoli, the officer who wrote the Facebook post, and Angelo Varisco, who liked the post online, had violated the department\u2019s social media policy. \u201cThis incident, we feel, has been an embarrassment to our department,\u201d Chief Lawson said at a news conference. \u201cThese officers have certainly acted in a manner which was unprofessional, alluding to a violent act to be conducted against a sitting U.S. congressman, a member of our government. We\u2019re not going to tolerate that.\u201d Mr. Rispoli, a 14-year veteran of the Police Department, said in a Facebook post on Thursday that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u201cneeds a round \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean the kind she used to serve,\u201d a reference to her past work as a bartender, according to a screenshot of the comment obtained by The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. Mr. Varisco joined the department in 2016. In the screenshot, his name can be seen as one of four who reacted to the post, either with a laughing face emoji or a thumbs-up. Neither Mr. Rispoli nor Mr. Varisco could be reached for comment on Monday evening. \u201cI applaud the investigation,\u201d Belinda Constant, the mayor of Gretna, said in an interview. \u201cI think it was done appropriately, it was done expeditiously, and it absolutely was the right decision.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, is a self-described democratic socialist and has been a strong critic of President Trump. She is one of four first-year female Democrats in the House \u2014 three of whom were born in the United States \u2014 who were told by Mr. Trump to \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries in a Twitter post last week. A representative of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment on Monday night. Chief Lawson said he had trouble understanding Mr. Rispoli\u2019s post, especially since the article he shared \u2014 which claimed that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had said soldiers were paid too much \u2014 was satirical. \u201cI think he just got caught up in the heat of the moment,\u201d Chief Lawson said. \u201cAnd this wasn\u2019t even a real news article.\u201d Neither officer had patrolled the streets, Chief Lawson said. He said Mr. Varisco had provided security for the courts, and Mr. Rispoli had also worked in the courts before he began supervising \u201cindividuals who were in the home incarceration program.\u201d The action against the officers in Louisiana came at a time of increased scrutiny of police officers\u2019 activity on social media. Last month, researchers with the Plain View Project released a compilation of troubling posts made by public safety officers. They examined eight police departments across the country and found that \u2014 of the Facebook profiles they could verify \u2014 about one in five current officers, including many in supervisory roles, and more than two in five former officers used content that was misogynist, racist, Islamophobic or otherwise biased, or that undermined the concept of due process. The project spawned investigations and repercussions in Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Louis and elsewhere. Chief Lawson said that Gretna police officers had been trained and made aware of other episodes across the country in which officials had gotten into trouble for inappropriate social media posts. \u201cWith all of those efforts, something like this still happens,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very disturbing. It certainly shows a lack of the officers paying attention to what\u2019s going on in the world around them.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When Mark Sanford was running for a South Carolina House seat in 2013 and wanted to make a point about the brand of liberalism he would fight in Washington, he staged a mock debate with a life-size picture of Nancy Pelosi, which his campaign staff had custom made at a local copy shop. Today, for $64.95, anyone who wants to make a political prop out of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Republican Party\u2019s newest antagonist, can buy a 5-foot-6 cardboard cutout of her at Walmart\u2019s online store. After barely eight months in office, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and three other progressive women of color have reached a level of notoriety that is virtually unheard-of for freshman House members, largely thanks to the kind of relentless conservative fire usually trained on far more senior Democrats. Ms. Pelosi, the House speaker whose \u201cSan Francisco values\u201d were the focus of tens of millions of dollars and nearly a decade\u2019s worth of Republican attacks, is Public Enemy No. 1 no more. Even Hillary Clinton, who inspired President Trump\u2019s crowds to thunder \u201cLock her up!\u201d or Barack Obama, whose ethnic background drew false speculation about his citizenship and religion, are no longer inspiring the kind of vitriol the right has leveled at the four women. Led by Mr. Trump, Republicans have used the four congresswomen, known as \u201cthe squad\u201d \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 as a visual aid for the nationalist, us-versus-them message he seems eager to pursue for the 2020 election. Their attacks on the congresswomen, with only a handful of dissenters, show how broadly accepted Mr. Trump\u2019s racial and cultural instigations have become in the Republican Party. \u201cPolitics is supposed to be about ideas,\u201d said Mr. Sanford, who won that election with the mock Pelosi debate in 2013 and served in the House until 2019 after losing to a more pro-Trump Republican in a primary. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve now done is to take it to another level, which is to say to some extent it\u2019s about ideas, but it\u2019s about personality more.\u201d \u201cI never said Nancy Pelosi didn\u2019t love America,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s where some of this has been taken to levels that are dangerous.\u201d Mr. Trump has done little to discourage the demonization, and the attacks have metastasized. His Twitter harangue that the women should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from \u2014 though all are citizens and all but one, Ms. Omar, were born in the United States \u2014 turned into chants of \u201csend her back\u201d at a recent Trump rally. Those kinds of sentiments have multiplied on social media, which has exploded with memes in recent days calling the four everything from terrorists to harpies to cancer. The president has also had plenty of support from the conservative media. From Fox News, where Tucker Carlson has lent credence to unproven claims that Ms. Omar once married her brother, to the talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who for months has introduced Ms. Ocasio-Cortez by enunciating each syllable of her name with a mimicked Spanish accent, many conservatives depict the four women in a way that recalls how they questioned Mr. Obama\u2019s loyalties and background. Speaking on Mr. Carlson\u2019s show this week, a guest claimed, \u201cWe\u2019re not even sure Omar is her real name.\u201d These portrayals have filtered down to the average pro-Trump, anti-liberal voter and activist. At a party for the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington in February, people defaced a cardboard cutout of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, scribbling \u201cstupid\u201d in vulgar Spanish slang on her face. Recently, the Facebook account of the Illinois Republican County Chairmen\u2019s Association posted a doctored image of the four that called them \u201cThe Jihad Squad.\u201d Ms. Pressley, who is black, was Photoshopped with a pistol in her hand. The association later took down the image and apologized, saying that the posting was not authorized. Public opinion polls show that significantly more Americans view the four women unfavorably than favorably \u2014 a remarkable level of infamy for any House member to reach after less than a year on the job. While it is not unusual for partisans to move on to fresh targets, the four women have less power, fewer achievements and lower national profiles than past Republican targets like Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton. None are seeking the presidency, or even a leadership position in the House. Whether the vilification has damaged the Democratic Party as a whole is unclear, as is whether these attacks will have staying power once the Democrats choose their presidential nominee next year \u2014 and there is an actual face to put on the party. Mr. Trump is convinced it will help him, said people who have spoken to him in recent days. And he rejected those who have told him otherwise, responding with certitude, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d Joshua Ulibarri, a partner at the Democratic research firm Lake Research Partners, said that his party would be wise to assess what Mr. Trump is really trying to accomplish \u2014 rally the faithful while also converting nonvoters who are inclined to be sympathetic to his nationalistic appeals. \u201cThey know our side is coming out,\u201d Mr. Ulibarri said. But what Mr. Trump has failed to take into account, he added, is that the squad \u201chas motived our base, especially young women and people of color.\u201d He recommended that Democrats harness that energy to avoid the low turnout of minority voters that hurt them in 2016. \u201cFor us to not promote that means we haven\u2019t learned our lesson,\u201d he said. But Democrats would risk losing voters who are not as progressive if Americans believe that the four House Democrats and their call for sweeping change on issues like immigration and health care \u2014 dismantling the Department of Homeland Security, for instance, as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez recently suggested \u2014 represent the party as a whole. Democratic strategists conceded that their candidates have had a hard time getting traction because of the outsize place Mr. Trump occupies in the media. \u201cThe media attention is driven by whatever Trump is talking about \u2014 and that\u2019s what people hear, that\u2019s what filters down, \u201d said Tresa Undem, a partner with the research firm PerryUndem, who has been surveying likely Democratic primary voters in recent weeks. \u201cOn any given issue they know nothing about it unless Trump has had a take on it at some point, and the media has covered it on a sustained basis,\u201d she added. \u201cAnything else doesn\u2019t break through.\u201d Months before Mr. Trump started tweeting about the four \u2014 telling them to \u201cgo back\u201d if they did not like America and calling them racist, weak, anti-American and \u201cnot very smart\u201d \u2014 conservatives had been watching them closely and covering their public remarks with an intensity that far surpassed the coverage that most of the two dozen Democratic candidates for president were receiving. The congresswomen sometimes did themselves no favors. Ms. Omar, who is Muslim, was heavily criticized after making comments that were widely condemned as anti-Semitic. Her statements and tweets, including one that pro-Israel activists were pushing \u201cfor allegiance to a foreign country,\u201d led the House to pass a resolution in March that condemned \u201chateful expressions of intolerance,\u201d by an overwhelming 407-to-23 vote. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s identification as a democratic socialist, and her huge profile on social media, made her catnip for the right. She became a national media sensation after her stunning upset of a white male Democrat who had represented her district for nearly two decades. But the mentions of her in right-leaning media \u2014 hardly ever presented in a flattering light \u2014 proliferated after she led the public relations efforts behind the Democrats\u2019 Green New Deal, a progressive proposal to fight climate change. No member of Congress in memory had made such a splash so fast. Most Americans had never heard of or had no opinion about senators like Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Elizabeth Warren a year and a half into their first terms, according to Gallup. But after only two months on the job, most Americans said they knew Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Gallup reported. But by then, more people already had an unfavorable impression than a positive one, polls showed. After Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office published talking points that contained an aside about getting rid of \u201cfarting cows and airplanes,\u201d conservatives pounced, incorrectly claiming that Democrats would end commercial aviation and stop beef production. But with Mr. Trump and others pushing such sensational claims, the Green New Deal gained in notoriety. One recent poll conducted by the Democratic Global Strategy Group found that 69 percent of Fox News-watching Republicans had heard about the proposal, compared with just 33 percent of Democrats. All of this is reminiscent of the way Republicans started hammering Ms. Pelosi in 2010 because of her role in getting the Affordable Care Act passed. The time and money spent reminding voters of comments she made about the bill \u2014 she once said Congress needed to pass it so that Americans could see what was in it \u2014 helped Republicans put a public face on Democratic leadership. And it belonged to someone who happened to be from the city that inspires some of the most cartoonish portrayals of liberals, San Francisco. Republicans took back the House that year, deposing Ms. Pelosi as speaker. They kept vilifying her with some success in congressional elections for the next eight years, driving her approval rating below 30 percent at times and holding on to their House majority. But by 2018, the attacks were no longer working as well. When Democrats took control of the House in last year\u2019s elections, more voters were galvanized by and preoccupied with another unpopular leader: Mr. Trump.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Six days after Democrats swept to power in the House, a quartet of newly elected women of color met in Washington for the first time. Somebody snapped a picture, and one of them \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 posted it on Instagram with a one-word caption: \u201cSquad.\u201d Today, that foursome \u2014 Representatives Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 may be Washington\u2019s best-known political clique. But their forceful brand of progressive politics and command of the spotlight rankles some fellow Democrats, including the most important Democrat in Washington: Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who on Friday appeared to make peace with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 at least for now. \u201cIn a family, you have your differences, but you\u2019re still family,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told reporters after the two met privately for 30 minutes, at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s request. She acknowledged \u201csome personality issues\u201d in the caucus, but called them \u201cminor.\u201d Lionized by the liberal left and vilified by President Trump \u2014 who is waging a relentless campaign to attack them as anti-American \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and the others roared into Washington in January as part of the most diverse freshman class in American history, and quickly emerged as a proxy for the debate over the future of the Democratic Party, exposing its ideological and generational divisions. Tensions between the quartet and Ms. Pelosi erupted into public view this month amid a fight over humanitarian aid to the border. The women blasted the aid package as insufficient and voted against it. Ms. Pelosi dismissed them as \u201cfour people\u201d who \u201cdidn\u2019t have any following.\u201d Then Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, took shots at the speaker on Twitter \u2014 a stunning breach of protocol for a young lawmaker and an unelected aide. Ms. Omar infuriated many veteran Democrats this year with remarks many deemed anti-Semitic. Ms. Tlaib took the party off course on Day 1 with her off-color promise to impeach Mr. Trump. But fences are being mended. Ms. Omar is joining Ms. Pelosi on an official trip next week to Ghana. Ms. Tlaib appeared at a fund-raiser with Ms. Pelosi over the weekend; when the speaker was in Detroit on Monday, she was greeted by protesters chanting, \u201cSupport the squad!\u201d They do not always vote the same way. Ms. Pressley broke with the others this week to vote for a resolution condemning the boycott Israel movement. Just two of them \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Tlaib \u2014 voted for a two-year spending package that passed on Thursday. But people close to the women say they have forged genuine friendships and a close bond. They communicate regularly via a private text chain, as do their chiefs of staff and their communications directors. On occasion, their offices plot strategy together and coordinate media appearances, including a joint news conference last week and an interview with Gayle King of CBS News to push back against Mr. Trump. All declined interviews for this article. \u201cWhat we are, are four women who have an alignment of values, shared policy priorities, who have repeatedly happened to land in the same place on the issue of immigration,\u201d Ms. Pressley, who keeps the lowest profile of the four, told Ms. King. \u201cThat is it. There is no insurgency here. There\u2019s nothing conspiratorial.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks \u2014 in a tweet this month he told the women to \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries, even though only one of them, Ms. Omar, a Somali refugee, was born outside the United States \u2014 prompted Democrats to rally around them. The House voted to condemn the president\u2019s comments as racist, and even moderates like Representative C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a centrist from Maryland who had trouble remembering Ms. Omar\u2019s name, stood behind them. \u201cI said, \u2018Look, you don\u2019t know me; we\u2019ve only met once or twice,\u201d Mr. Ruppersberger said, recounting a conversation with Ms. Omar after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cBut I can tell you this: \u2018I\u2019m behind you 100 percent.\u2019\u201d Still, Mr. Ruppersberger said he and other moderates were wary of the women, fearing they would push primary challengers to run against them. And while progressives view the four as some of the most exciting figures in the Democratic Party, they did not make a good impression with some of their more senior colleagues when they showed up for work in January. \u201cI think when the new generation comes in, sometimes they don\u2019t understand what it is to be in the majority,\u201d Mr. Ruppersberger said. All four landed in Washington as firsts. Ms. Pressley, 45, a former member of the Boston City Council, is the first black woman to represent Massachusetts; Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, a former bartender and onetime organizer for Senator Bernie Sanders, is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress and the first Latina to represent her district. Ms. Omar, 36, is a former state legislator and the first woman to wear a hijab on the House floor. She and Ms. Tlaib, 43, a lawyer and former state legislator who is of Palestinian descent, are the first two Muslim women in Congress. Both have been the subject of fierce criticism for their views on Israel. The four are the only freshmen elected with the backing of Justice Democrats, a grass-roots organizing group that burst onto the scene last year after helping Ms. Ocasio-Cortez with her stunning primary defeat of Joe Crowley, the No. 4 Democratic leader. During the campaign, some of them connected through social media, and after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez won her primary, she helped the others. \u201cThese are four women of color who speak truth to power, who do not want to maintain the status quo and are going to fight like hell, like they have nothing to lose, for the biggest solutions to some of our biggest problems,\u201d Alexandra Rojas, Justice Democrats\u2019s executive director, said in an interview. \u201cThey are all doing exactly what they said they were going to be doing on the campaign trail.\u201d Although the four women share political ideology, they also came together in part because of happenstance. A bipartisan group called VoteRunLead, which trains women to run for office and was meeting in New York, asked the women to sit for a joint Facebook Live interview when they were in Washington after the 2018 midterm elections, when the photo posted on Instagram of them was taken. VoteRunLead\u2019s founder, Erin Vilardi, said she would have included another progressive woman of color \u2014 Representative Lauren Underwood of Illinois \u2014 in the interview, had Ms. Underwood been available at that hour. \u201cThe four of them are unique, and I would include Lauren Underwood in that,\u201d Ms. Vilardi said. \u201cThey\u2019re challenging norms on leadership and what it means to be a strong leader.\u201d Moderates are not the only Democrats who bristle at the women \u2014 or at least the group that backs them. Some veteran members of the Congressional Black Caucus railed against Justice Democrats \u2014 and by implication, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff, Mr. Chakrabarti, who founded it \u2014 in an article in The Hill newspaper. Two senior Democratic aides, both speaking on the condition of anonymity, said several Democratic lawmakers have urged Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to dismiss Mr. Chakrabarti, arguing that his outspokenness is undermining her. Mr. Chakrabarti, who is on paternity leave, did not respond to a request for comment; nor did a spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Waleed Shahid, the Justice Democrats\u2019s communications director, showed no signs of tempering his criticism. On Friday afternoon, as Capitol Hill talked of rapprochement, he used Twitter to talk up conflict: \u201cI don\u2019t understand the aversion to conflict and vague calls for \u2018unity\u2019 on the Hill. Of course, there will be conflict between someone who primaried the 4th ranking House Democrat, participated in a sit-in at @SpeakerPelosi\u2019s office, & encouraged more people to run in primaries.\u201d The foursome\u2019s one unquestionable good for the party is fund-raising; Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, has already raised $2 million this cycle. But with Mr. Trump determined to make the women the face of the party, some Democrats say they need to tone it down \u2014 or at least be more careful with their words. \u201cThey have been thrust into the middle of a debate about the heart and soul of this country, and that does carry with it a unique set of responsibilities,\u201d said Representative Tom Malinowski, a centrist Democrat from New Jersey. \u201cHe has now put them in a very special position. It would be my hope that all of us, wherever we fall on the ideological spectrum, will advance our agenda while embracing in every possible way the patriotism that we share with all of our fellow Americans.\u201d",

      "content": "[Read Astead W. Herndon\u2019s article on how the young activists of the Sunrise Movement have become political power players in the 2020 presidential race.] Many Democrats want their 2020 presidential nominee to do two things above all: Defeat Donald Trump and protect the planet from imminent environmental disaster. But liberal activists, party officials and even some of the candidates themselves disagree on how far left the party should go to successfully accomplish both tasks. How they settle their differences over proposals like the Green New Deal, a groundbreaking climate-change plan, will likely influence the party\u2019s \u2014 and the country\u2019s \u2014 future. \u201cThe Weekly\u201d embeds with the young, liberal activists of the Sunrise Movement for three months as they aggressively press their case for revolutionary measures alongside Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders. And we catch up with the Democratic frontrunner, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and other party loyalists, some of whom warn that radical policies may jeopardize their chances of beating Trump, who has mocked the threat of climate change in the past. [Join the conversation about @theweekly on Twitter and Instagram. #TheWeeklyNYT.]  The Democratic Party\u2019s leftward shift since the 2016 presidential election is undeniable. The 2018 midterm election results and the tenor of the early stages of the 2020 presidential race show that, in most areas, progressives have pushed Democrats left on a number of issues. Candidates are discussing Supreme Court expansion, reparations, single-payer health care, and free college \u2014 in addition to the Green New Deal. Even Biden\u2019s seemingly moderate campaign is more liberal than any of his previous runs for office in his 50-year political career. The establishment is nervous. Older, more moderate Democrats say the way back to the White House is to reclaim many people who voted for President Trump in 2016, and they point to wins by moderate Democrats in 2018 congressional races and Midwestern gubernatorial contests as proof of their strategy. The more candidates who embrace far-left positions like the Green New Deal, the more unsettled many moderates become. Democrats of all stripes are up against the Trump campaign juggernaut. The president\u2019s re-election campaign, as you can see from his campaign rallies, has largely been about energizing his base with sweeping and incendiary attacks against his opponents. Democrats, despite the infighting, have largely kept the primary debate focused on policy. They must ultimately come together around their nominee if they are to defeat an incumbent who has united the Republican base. [Astead answered questions on Reddit about the Sunrise Movement, the Green New Deal and  the Democratic presidential primary politics. Read the transcript.]  Varshini Prakash, the co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, is still the group\u2019s executive director. The group helped bring more than 1,000 young people to Detroit for the second Democratic presidential debate, where they tried to push candidates to further commit to the Green New Deal. Rhiana Gunn-Wright, the policy director for New Consensus, lives in Washington, where she works with progressive groups to win broad support for the Green New Deal and other progressive policies. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York continues to gather supporters for her climate initiative. She\u2019s faced pushback from party leaders, who introduced their own climate proposal that stops short of the Green New Deal\u2019s most ambitious goals, but goes further than previous policies put forward by Democrats. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is running for president a second time. Though he\u2019s stalled in the polls in recent weeks, he remains a leading contender for the Democratic nomination and has maintained a fundraising edge over his rivals. He\u2019s a vigorous supporter of the Green New Deal. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\u2019s strategy of projecting unity with the other Democratic candidates was rattled in the first primary debate, when Senator Kamala Harris of California challenged his record and personal views. Biden, who leads the Democratic primary field in national polls, is more vocally highlighting his differences with other candidates and leaning in to the moderate label more explicitly.",

      "content": " Representative Ayanna Pressley broke with traditional diversity politics last month when she said at a conference in Philadelphia, \u201cWe don\u2019t need black faces that don\u2019t want to be a black voice.\u201d Instead, \u201cwe need you to represent that voice.\u201d The members of the so-called squad who were also on the panel nodded in agreement. They are the defiant and unapologetic voices of the communities that produced them. Since being elected last fall, these four progressive Democratic congresswomen have pushed the limits of what most liberals mean by the contested term \u201cdiversity.\u201d Some of their colleagues in Washington may have preferred that they simply come in and add color to the halls of Congress \u2014 but in every other way behave as their long-established white predecessors have. But they have a different agenda. They have a transformative notion of diversity that comes with a different set of expectations and metrics. They insist on bringing the concerns of historically marginalized communities into the rooms where decisions are made, even when that is seen as impolite or inappropriate. This is evident through their politics, priorities and style \u2014 not only their presence. Consider Rashida Tlaib\u2019s \u201cLift + Act\u201d bill, which comes as close as any to advancing the radical economic principle of universal guaranteed income that Martin Luther King Jr. so eloquently advocated some 50 years ago. They\u2019re exposing the false belief that American foreign policy is infallible. This is exemplified by their critique of Washington\u2019s unconditional support for Israel. And recall the memorable hearing in February when Ilhan Omar challenged Elliott Abrams, a Trump administration official, over his role in supporting Central American death squads in the 1980s. All of them, along with some other Democrats, have called for the outright abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of its widely publicized mistreatment of migrant families and children. The squad understands that \u201cdiversity\u201d is meaningless if the measure of success is \u201csameness.\u201d The congresswomen are choosing to do politics a different way because they recognize that Congress has never worked for their communities. From the start, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was urged to stay in her place when she insisted upon committee appointments deemed out of reach for a freshman representative. It was those committees that would have the most impact on the values she was elected to advance, and so she persisted, violating protocol in the process. She was doing something unprecedented when, as a political neophyte, she introduced the Green New Deal resolution without support from the party leadership. Similarly, Ms. Tlaib and Ms. Omar have called for President Trump\u2019s impeachment and passionately advocated the rights of Palestinians, breaking with the more tactically conservative approach of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, on both matters. However, as the scholar-activist Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor wrote in Jacobin, they don\u2019t just represent different personalities vis-\u00e0-vis Ms. Pelosi but different worldviews. Over the past nine months, the squad\u2019s members have made good on their promises to be agents of change, not just fresh faces. Radical inclusivity means that people from different communities, backgrounds and ideological traditions will do their jobs differently and will bring new sensibilities, commitments and understanding with them when they sit at the tables of power. If they are doing their jobs, they will be accountable to people who sent them there, not maintaining the status quo. Anything less is merely cosmetic. One outcome of exclusion and white privilege is that people of color don\u2019t see ourselves reflected in positions of power often enough. That is the least of it. A more consequential outcome is that our communities are underserved, our children racially profiled by the police, unfairly pushed out of schools or locked up in disproportionate numbers. \u201cWe expect elected officials to fight hard for a progressive agenda, and we are not cutting anyone slack simply because they look like us,\u201d argues Chinyere Tutashinda, a leader in the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 150 black-led organizations across the country. Ms. Tlaib cares deeply about accountability. She often tells her audiences that she proudly represents Michigan\u2019s 13th Congressional District, one of the poorest in the country, with one of the largest black populations of any district. She is committed to serving its interests and speaking with its voice. When, soon after she was sworn into office in January, she proclaimed that \u201cwe are going to impeach\u201d the president, that is the constituency she was speaking for: a population that feels assaulted by Republican policies and abandoned by mainstream Democrats. The squad has tilled new ground in reanimating a fighting spirit within the Democratic Party and revived its left flank. A more timid approach would have been to go to Washington and blend in. The women\u2019s approach is admirably and courageously to stand out. This is threatening and offensive to many of their conservative and, dare I say, racist colleagues. In his typical meanspirited manner, the president has hurled numerous insults at them; others have piled on too. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was all but foaming at the mouth on Fox News in July. They are \u201ca bunch of communists,\u201d he said, they \u201chate our own country.\u201d And \u201cthey stand for all the things most Americans disagree with.\u201d Really? A new poll by The Economist and YouGov indicates that each of the four women has a higher approval rating than Mr. Trump himself. And among independent voters, Mr. Trump still loses by more than 6 percentage points to each squad member. Speaker Pelosi, for her part, has alternated among a mild-mannered defense of her junior colleagues, dismissive comments and an outright reprimand in one instance. A similar dynamic is playing out in politics around the country, as the noted political strategist Jessica Byrd told me. Her electoral firm, Three Point Strategies, has been helping black activists win elections over the last five years. \u201cWithout fail, these women are discounted until the voices of the people they represent become too loud to ignore,\u201d she said. \u201cThese elections are an incredible symbol that movement can win and is winning. They are a symbol that accountability is possible.\u201d Many young activists feel protective of the congresswomen, seeing their vulnerabilities as linked. Thenjiwe McHarris was one of 100 black women who hosted a rally in April to protest the attacks and threats against Ms. Omar. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to the squad is deeply connected to what\u2019s happening to our communities and our progressive movements,\u201d she told me. But the squad, and so many other women of color in politics, are not the sit-down-and-shut-up types. And that has earned them widespread adoration. Thousands have signed petitions in their support. The congresswomen collectively enjoy millions of followers on Twitter. And they earn high praise from the millennial activists who have played a monumental but largely unknown role in pushing the party left. The squad was in part propelled to prominence by the Justice Democrats, a millennial-led group that has made the Democratic Party more accountable to its base through recruiting and endorsing candidates in competitive primaries. Maurice Mitchell, who now runs the Working Families Party, sees them as central to a seismic shift in electoral politics post-2016. \u201cThis moment has radicalized liberals and electoralized radicals,\u201d he told me. Meaning there are new political actors with new agendas and expectations. I am reminded of another \u201cdiversity\u201d moment when the establishment felt threatened. It was when Sonia Sotomayor was being considered for the Supreme Court in 2009. Her opponents had dredged up a speech from eight years earlier in which she said: \u201cI would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn\u2019t lived that life.\u201d She opined that the experience of racial and gender oppression, learned survival strategies and cultural practices could and should be brought to bear when representatives of marginalized communities assume decision-making roles. This caused quite a stir. But what she rightly seemed to suggest was that, if who we are doesn\u2019t matter, we are aiming for tokenism more than transformation of elite institutions. She was also intimating that, if I come in, my family, my community, my elders, my people, will in some form, come with me. These women \u2014 Justice Sotomayor and the squad \u2014 have all insisted upon bringing their whole selves into these insider spaces where women and people of color have been historically told to either \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from, or \u201clisten and learn\u201d in terms of how things are done if they want to succeed. The former message comes from the right, the latter from liberal insiders. A key demand of this new generation of activists of color has been accountability. They have seen historic numbers of women and black and brown people elected to office, including the nation\u2019s first black president. That alone is insufficient, they have decided. They have seen the limits of representational politics. They want leaders who are immersed in communities who remember where they came from when they attain positions of power. Or better yet, politicians who never leave in all the ways that matter. Well, the squad members, all with varying activist backgrounds, are a part of that generation. They are products of the Movement for Black Lives, #MeToo, Occupy Wall Street and an increasingly militant immigrant rights movement. These bold, game-changing social movements are led by a cohort of savvy young women organizers who are not afraid to speak truth to power and upset business as usual. If the millennial social movements are not \u201cyour grandmother\u2019s\u201d social movements, then the squad members are certainly not your typical \u201cminority\u201d politicians. They are wisely acting as if they represent the demographic and political majority that their generation will become. It is significant that a majority of millennials polled by Harvard researchers in 2016 rejected capitalism and leaned toward the left politics that these four congresswomen represent. They are not only the future of the Democratic Party. They are the future. So are their ideals. And we need more politicians like them.",

Herndon\u2019s article on how the young activists of the Sunrise Movement have become political power players in the 2020 presidential race.] Many Democrats want their 2020 presidential nominee to do two things above all: Defeat Donald Trump and protect the planet from imminent environmental disaster. But liberal activists, party officials and even some of the candidates themselves disagree on how far left the party should go to successfully accomplish both tasks. How they settle their differences over proposals like the Green New Deal, a groundbreaking climate-change plan, will likely influence the party\u2019s \u2014 and the country\u2019s \u2014 future. \u201cThe Weekly\u201d embeds with the young, liberal activists of the Sunrise Movement for three months as they aggressively press their case for revolutionary measures alongside Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders. And we catch up with the Democratic frontrunner, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and other party loyalists, some of whom warn that radical policies may jeopardize their chances of beating Trump, who has mocked the threat of climate change in the past. [Join the conversation about @theweekly on Twitter and Instagram. #TheWeeklyNYT.]  The Democratic Party\u2019s leftward shift since the 2016 presidential election is undeniable. The 2018 midterm election results and the tenor of the early stages of the 2020 presidential race show that, in most areas, progressives have pushed Democrats left on a number of issues. Candidates are discussing Supreme Court expansion, reparations, single-payer health care, and free college \u2014 in addition to the Green New Deal. Even Biden\u2019s seemingly moderate campaign is more liberal than any of his previous runs for office in his 50-year political career. The establishment is nervous. Older, more moderate Democrats say the way back to the White House is to reclaim many people who voted for President Trump in 2016, and they point to wins by moderate Democrats in 2018 congressional races and Midwestern gubernatorial contests as proof of their strategy. The more candidates who embrace far-left positions like the Green New Deal, the more unsettled many moderates become. Democrats of all stripes are up against the Trump campaign juggernaut. The president\u2019s re-election campaign, as you can see from his campaign rallies, has largely been about energizing his base with sweeping and incendiary attacks against his opponents. Democrats, despite the infighting, have largely kept the primary debate focused on policy. They must ultimately come together around their nominee if they are to defeat an incumbent who has united the Republican base. [Astead answered questions on Reddit about the Sunrise Movement, the Green New Deal and  the Democratic presidential primary politics. Read the transcript.]  Varshini Prakash, the co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, is still the group\u2019s executive director. The group helped bring more than 1,000 young people to Detroit for the second Democratic presidential debate, where they tried to push candidates to further commit to the Green New Deal. Rhiana Gunn-Wright, the policy director for New Consensus, lives in Washington, where she works with progressive groups to win broad support for the Green New Deal and other progressive policies. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York continues to gather supporters for her climate initiative. She\u2019s faced pushback from party leaders, who introduced their own climate proposal that stops short of the Green New Deal\u2019s most ambitious goals, but goes further than previous policies put forward by Democrats. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is running for president a second time. Though he\u2019s stalled in the polls in recent weeks, he remains a leading contender for the Democratic nomination and has maintained a fundraising edge over his rivals. He\u2019s a vigorous supporter of the Green New Deal. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\u2019s strategy of projecting unity with the other Democratic candidates was rattled in the first primary debate, when Senator Kamala Harris of California challenged his record and personal views. Biden, who leads the Democratic primary field in national polls, is more vocally highlighting his differences with other candidates and leaning in to the moderate label more explicitly.",

      "content": " On July 2, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, after a visit to migrant detention facilities run by Customs and Border Protection in Texas, claimed that the United States is \u201cheaded toward fascism.\u201d Much of the response that followed was expected, but little or none of it examined the statement closely or detailed to what degree the United States\u2019 immigration policy justifies such comparisons. So how apt is this analogy between the current situation and early years of fascist regimes? Liberal democracy organizes society around respect for the dignity, equality and freedom of all human beings. Fascism, by contrast, organizes society around the vilification of outsiders. In this administration\u2019s rhetoric toward undocumented immigrants from Central America and religious minorities, we have been subject to classic fascist tropes for some time. The obsessive focus on immigration and the representation of immigrants as invaders is particularly indicative of this ideology. In the 1930s, Oswald Mosley, the head of the British Union of Fascists, ran on a platform of ending immigration entirely. \u201cBritain for the British\u201d was its motto. Comparisons to the Nazi regime, one of which Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made last month when she called American detention facilities \u201cconcentration camps,\u201d are also routinely met with outrage. But Hitler, too, was obsessed with immigration. In \u201cMein Kampf\u201d he praised the \u201cnational State,\u201d and he saw foreign immigration as the obstacle. He wrote of America\u2019s anti-immigration policies as a model for a nationalistic Germany: The current American administration clearly does not share the toxic and murderous ideology of Nazism, nor its anti-Semitism, but when the president of the United States derides immigrants from \u201cshithole countries\u201d while pleading for more immigrants from Northern Europe, he echoes the very aspects of American history that Hitler praised. When we consider the character of a ruling government, we should think about the ideology that motivates it, as well as the institutions and tactics it employs to transform society. It is clear that this administration draws on fascist ideology in its rhetoric. But what about its institutions and tactics? On June 17, President Trump tweeted that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would deport millions of \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d He\u2019s not the first president to focus on undocumented immigrants for removal. Every president since the Sept. 11 attacks, including Barack Obama, has, too. But the Obama administration explicitly prioritized terrorists and serious criminal offenders. The Trump administration is the first in recent memory to target undocumented families for removal in planned mass deportation raids. Trump\u2019s announcement about mass deportations conveyed the kind of cruelty toward outsiders that he often uses to excite his base. It was only a matter of time before such rhetoric would begin to transform our institutions. ICE is a novel American institution \u2014 it was created in 2003 by the Homeland Security Act in the wake of Sept. 11, at a time when rights and liberties took a back seat to concerns about safety. The same act created the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, tasked with policing the border and staffing migrant detention centers. In ICE, we have a special force, created in an anti-democratic moment in American history, authorized with police-like power and directed at political outsiders inside our borders. The institution itself is tied politically to the country\u2019s leader. Trump is the first president endorsed by a major union representing ICE\u2019s employees, and Trump has repeatedly represented himself as its chief defender. ICE is an organization that is like the police but is not the police. The job of the police in a democratic society is to keep communities safe. In practice, ICE collaborates with conventional American criminal justice institutions, including local police departments, but often end up working at cross-purposes with them by creating fear in immigrant communities, whose members become less likely to report crime. As a result, some police chiefs have aligned themselves recently against ICE raids. The goal of ICE is not to make communities safer. ICE\u2019s mission is to reinforce a distinction between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d The Trump administration has advanced its more aggressive policies of enforcement by characterizing undocumented immigrants as a group of criminals, rather than as individuals. In 2017, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly ordered ICE to portray immigrants in general as intrinsically prone to crime to justify mass arrests by highlighting \u201cthree egregious cases\u201d to use in the media. This tactic of identifying whole groups as criminal has a shameful history. In my grandmother\u2019s 1957 memoir of 1930s Berlin, she reports similar tactics by the Gestapo in 1937, who spoke of \u201ccriminal\u201d Jews while arresting Jewish citizens who had committed minor traffic violations. To be sure, no organizations precisely like the Nazi SS or the SA or Italy\u2019s fascist Blackshirts operate in the United States today. There is no organization empowered to make arrests that originated as a paramilitary force, or that has an official racist ideology, or that is used to overtly target political opponents. ICE is not the SS or the Gestapo. But it has concerning similarities, including its symbiotic relationship with an increasingly authoritarian president. And it is not the only institution with disturbing fascist elements; evidence of extreme racism and sexism has emerged among members of its sister organization, Customs and Border Protection. The special circumstances under which ICE was created and now operates also lends credence to the argument that ICE is expendable, a nonessential and arguably harmful arm of government that could be eliminated. What about the private detention centers for undocumented immigrants, which Ms. Ocasio-Cortez described last month as concentration camps? After the comparison, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum issued a news release denouncing comparisons to the Holocaust. In response, hundreds of historians and other academics working on the Holocaust and genocide responded with a letter defending the importance of these analogies. As Kica Matos at the Vera Institute of Justice explained to me, journalists are barred from visiting these centers; they are open only to legal representatives and members of Congress. In early June, the Trump administration canceled educational, recreational and legal aid for migrant children in detention centers, sealing them off further from public view. Reports of the extreme conditions in these centers have flooded the news in recent weeks. These reports have been provided by legal representatives empowered to visit them. What happens now, as Ms. Matos asked,  that funding is cut off for such visits? Even as we are shut off from facts, immigrants will hear the stories from one another. The strategy here is to encourage them to self-deport. This, too, is familiar from history. In the November 1938 pogrom of German Jews, more than 30,000 of them were rounded up and sent to concentration camps, where they were subjected to brutal and inhumane conditions and soon released. In \u201cKL: A History of the Nazi Concentration Camps,\u201d Nikolaus Wachsmann, a professor of European history at the University of London, explains that the release of these prisoners made sense from the regime\u2019s perspective, because \u201cthe camps had served their function \u2014 forcing many Jews out of Germany.\u201d The regime\u2019s harsh anti-Semitic rhetoric, followed by exposure of its Jewish citizens to the brutality of its camps, led to a large exodus of Jews from Germany (including my grandmother and my father in July 1939). The tactic worked. Should we therefore employ it? There is an economic reality to this situation as well. We increasingly see connections between powerful business interests and the institutions of state terror. Wall Street gives billions in loans to facilitate the profits of companies who run detention centers; large companies make profits by selling their wares to them, and former high ranking administration officials serve on their boards. On the local level, county jails enjoy newfound profits by housing those detained by ICE\u2019s massively broadened mandate. A refusal to discuss fascism in the current political context in the United States obscures both the nature of fascism, representing it as an all-or-nothing matter, as well as our own troubling past. The extent to which a society is liberal democratic or fascist can be measured on a continuum. In the struggles with our racist history \u2014 against black Americans, Native Americans and immigration from non-Northern European countries \u2014 the United States has always had aspects of both. With the development of a police-like force directed specifically to force outsiders into hiding, detention centers sealed off from public view in which to detain them and an economy set up to profit from it all, we move in the wrong direction.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Two of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s top aides who were instrumental in forging her unexpected path to victory last year are leaving Capitol Hill, less than a month after one of them ignited a firestorm by challenging Speaker Nancy Pelosi and comparing moderate House Democrats to segregationists. House Democrats had been privately calling for the ouster of Saikat Chakrabarti, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s embattled chief of staff. He and Corbin Trent, her communications director, had gone to Capitol Hill determined to wage their confrontational brand of progressive politics forged as leaders of Justice Democrats, a group dedicated to unseating entrenched Democratic lawmakers through primary campaigns. Justice Democrats helped Ms. Ocasio-Cortez sweep to power with the defeat of a veteran House Democrat, Joseph Crowley. But less than a year later, after a bruising skirmish this summer with Democratic leadership, both are calling it quits, they told The Intercept on Friday. Their departures will be seen as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s most tangible peace offering since her private meeting last week with Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chakrabarti \u201chas decided to leave the office of Representative Ocasio-Cortez to work with New Consensus to further develop plans for a Green New Deal,\u201d Mr. Trent told The Intercept, referring to the congresswoman\u2019s ambitious climate change program. \u201cWe are extraordinarily grateful for his service to advance a bold agenda and improve the lives of the people in\u201d New York\u2019s 14th District. The New Consensus is a liberal nonprofit organization dedicated to developing and promoting the Green New Deal. Mr. Trent will return to working on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign. Mr. Chakrabarti, intent on continuing his anti-establishment movement from inside the halls of power, had rankled lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill after he posted on Twitter his support for liberal candidates trying to topple sitting Democrats and his disdain for Ms. Pelosi\u2019s legislative prowess. His challenges to elected leaders were considered in Congress to be remarkable breaches of protocol from an unelected aide. His position became untenable last month after he compared moderate Democrats who sank a liberal emergency border aid package to \u201cnew Southern Democrats.\u201d They \u201ccertainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s,\u201d he tweeted. He later deleted the post, but the damage was done. In an extraordinary effort to crack down on the chief of staff, Democratic leaders leveraged the House Democratic Caucus\u2019s official Twitter account to resurrect a tweet by Mr. Chakrabarti that said that he believed Representative Sharice Davids of Kansas, one of the first two Native American women to serve in Congress, was enabling a \u201cracist system\u201d in voting for a weaker border aid package. \u201cWho is this guy and why is he explicitly singling out a Native American woman of color?\u201d House Democratic leaders asked on Twitter. Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, privately implored Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to fire Mr. Chakrabarti to wipe the slate clean.",

      "author": "Jeffery C. Mays",
      "content": " [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] President Trump and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are diametrical opposites in nearly every way, except perhaps for their shared home state of New York and their social media dominance. But now there may be another thing that binds the two: a federal appeals panel ruling on Tuesday found that Mr. Trump, a Republican, has been violating the Constitution by blocking people from following him on Twitter because they criticized or mocked him. That ruling is now the basis of two lawsuits filed against Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, accusing her of blocking people because of their opposing political stances. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has 4.7 million followers on her personal Twitter account, @AOC, which she uses to frequently discuss policy and advocate her proposals, such as the Green New Deal and her belief that the camps holding children and other undocumented immigrants seeking asylum at the Texas border are \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d Dov Hikind, a former assemblyman from Brooklyn who is the founder of Americans Against Anti-Semitism, said he regularly replied to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tweets, but was blocked on July 8. Joseph Saladino, a YouTube personality known as \u201cJoey Salads\u201d who is running for a congressional seat representing Brooklyn and Staten Island, said he was blocked on May 9. But because Ms. Ocasio-Cortez uses the account to discuss policies that affect them, she cannot use it to \u201csuppress contrary views\u201d and violate his First Amendment rights to free speech, Mr. Hikind said in his lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear based on the court\u2019s ruling that A.O.C. is violating my constitutional rights to free speech by excluding me,\u201d Mr. Hikind said in an interview. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me to be a part of the discussion and conversation.\u201d Mr. Hikind said he was blocked after criticizing Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for her concentration camp comments. \u201cShe has a right to have that position. That\u2019s not the issue. The question is why is she afraid of other people\u2019s positions?\u201d he added. Mr. Saladino, whose pranks have been criticized as racist, filed a separate lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan. He said that as a practical matter, he does not care if Ms. Ocasio-Cortez blocked him because he can still access her Twitter comments from an anonymous account. He said his complaint is a test of whether there is a double standard in the courts for liberals and conservatives. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s like a social experiment to see if the standards will apply equally,\u201d Mr. Saladino said. \u201cWill the courts rule the same way against A.O.C. as Trump?\u201d Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, declined to comment about pending litigation. Blocking on social media is done across political party lines. In 2017, for example, ProPublica sent letters asking all 50 governors and 22 federal agencies whether they had blocked people on social media. Five Republican governors, four Democrats and four agencies responded with information about people they had blocked. Many agencies and more than half the governors did not respond. In New York, the issue has arisen with Representative Peter King, a 14-term Republican congressman who represents parts of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island. In April, the New York Civil Liberties Union threatened to sue Mr. King if he did not unblock the 70 or so constituents who were banned from his \u201cCongressman Peter King\u201d Facebook page for criticizing him. In May, Mr. King added a new Facebook page that he said would be his official government account, and that he would not ban people from it. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s @AOC account is not her official congressional account. Her official congressional account, @RepAOC, has 172,000 followers and was last updated July 5, as of Wednesday afternoon. Jacob Weinstein, Mr. Hikind\u2019s lawyer, noted that the court ruling concerned the @realDonaldTrump personal account, with its 61.8 million followers, that Mr. Trump uses most often to comment on Twitter, not his official presidential Twitter account. \u201cIt comes down to the First Amendment,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said. \u201cTwitter is a public forum. Imagine a politician is giving a town hall. Imagine if they only select people they like.\u201d In the appeals court ruling against Mr. Trump, the panel considered the function of the social media account over its form, said Katie Fallow, a senior attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University who filed and argued the lawsuit against the president. The ruling doesn\u2019t prevent elected officials from acting to prevent true threats or from muting individuals on Twitter. \u201cWe certainly think that Representative Ocasio-Cortez has been a very enthusiastic and good advocate for free speech and dissent,\u201d Ms. Fallow added, \u201cand we hope she would look at this court decision and conclude the better way is not to block people that are criticizing her.\u201d",

      "content": " Was it an infantile expectoration or part of a grand plan? Did he count to 10 before he tweeted or just let the ugliness rip? That\u2019s the question whenever Donald Trump drops a bomb like his suggestion that four congresswomen of color \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries from which they came. This time the answer is easy. The president knew exactly what he was doing. With his attack on the congresswomen \u2014 three of whom were born, as was he, in these United States \u2014 he had specific goals. They\u2019re all about the 2020 presidential campaign, which has now begun in full and will rapidly devolve into a grotesqueness that is sure to make 2016 look like a garden party with cucumber sandwiches. He wants to reframe it, so that he\u2019s running not against whomever the Democrats wind up nominating but against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley. Against who they are individually. Against what they represent ideologically. Against what they telegraph about the demographic direction of the country and about a new distribution \u2014 a new sharing \u2014 of power. [Get a more personal, less conventional take on political developments, newsmakers, cultural milestones and more with Frank Bruni\u2019s exclusive commentary every week. Sign up for his newsletter.] Trump doesn\u2019t want to run against Joe Biden, because no matter Biden\u2019s energy level or the oxymoronic record that\u2019s almost inevitable when you\u2019ve put in as many decades in public service as he has, he radiates decency the way Trump glows orange from makeup and tanning beds. He doesn\u2019t want to run against Elizabeth Warren, because all the nicknames in the world won\u2019t erase her seriousness, which brings his incoherence into vivid relief. He doesn\u2019t want to run against Kamala Harris, because he has seen how poised and fierce she can be. Besides, it\u2019s better to run against four people than against one. Four are more readily turned into an idea. A symbol. And what do Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib and Pressley symbolize? The oldest of them, Pressley, is 45. Their average age is 38. They suggest in aggregate that the future of both the Democratic Party and the country belongs as much to women and to people of color as to anyone else. Trump is betting that Americans threatened by that will be scared enough to drive up the turnout for him. He\u2019s wagering, too, that enough voters whose allegiances aren\u2019t predetermined will balk at that \u2014 and will overlook his administration\u2019s dysfunction and his own indecency \u2014 to keep him in the White House. So he wants the four congresswomen front and center, which is where his tweet put them. They put themselves there on Monday, at a news conference to respond to him. Omar called for his impeachment. I bet he was fine with that. The four congresswomen \u2014 the Squad, as they\u2019ve come to be known \u2014 make the Democratic Party look much more progressive than it actually is. The president and his minions are counting on that. And unlike Democrats\u2019 eventual pick to take on Trump, the Squad won\u2019t be sanding down their most leftward edges or striking notes ambiguous or elastic enough to soothe the center. That\u2019s a presidential-nominee thing. That\u2019s most definitely not a first-term-in-the-House thing. These four are also a tool for promoting discord in the Democratic ranks, because as the recent feud between them and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demonstrated, plenty of their fellow Democrats find them too fantastically idealistic, too censorious of those who disagree with them, too quick to play the race card, too much. For now, Trump\u2019s shocking and unconscionable tweet has downgraded that feud and united Democrats, who immediately drafted a House resolution that formally condemns his comments as racist. They\u2019re daring Republicans to vote against it and seemingly go on record in support of what he said. But that\u2019s just for now. What happens next week, next month and next year is an open question. It\u2019s no accident that around the same time that Trump fired off his racist tweet, Democratic strategists were, according to a report in Axios, circulating a private poll of potential swing voters \u2014 white people with two years of college or less \u2014 that showed that 74 percent of them recognized Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s name but only 22 percent had a favorable view of her, while 53 percent recognized Omar but only 9 percent saw her favorably. If Democrats have numbers like that, Republicans almost certainly do, too. And Republicans know how to pick \u2014 and pick apart \u2014 their enemies. But Trump is up to something else as well. He means to send liberals into such a fury that they believe that passionately calling him out and urging the opposite of whatever he\u2019s saying and doing are strategy enough. He\u2019s baiting them. Why are so many Democratic presidential candidates recommending what sounds a lot like open borders, which won\u2019t go down well with many of the voters the party needs? It\u2019s a response in part to Trump\u2019s xenophobia and cruelty when it comes to immigration. Similarly, the candidates\u2019 gusto for Medicare for all, whose popularity is highly debatable, owes at least something to Trump\u2019s assault on Obamacare and complete disregard for uninsured Americans. Many Democrats are defining themselves as antonyms to Trump. That\u2019s different from merely opposing him, and it might not be the way to go. Trump gets that. He\u2019s ignorant, not stupid. And he understands that if he causes enough offense and creates enough melodrama, the screaming in the public square will be so loud that many battered and baffled Americans won\u2019t be able to hear the inner voice that\u2019s telling them what they should and at some level do know: that he must go. That the price of giving him eight years in the White House could be the soul of a great nation. That we can\u2019t afford that.",

      "content": " Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s re-election campaign regained access to its Twitter account on Friday, days after getting locked out for posting a tweet that Twitter had flagged as inappropriate. The tweet, which the campaign sent Tuesday out of its @Team_Mitch account, included a video of people making violent threats against the majority leader in front of his Louisville, Ky., home. In text accompanying the video, the campaign labeled the protesters as an \u201cangry left-wing mob.\u201d Twitter hid the tweet and locked the campaign out of the account on the basis that the tweet \u2014 with the video embedded \u2014 contained a threat and had violated the platform\u2019s \u201cabusive behavior policy.\u201d That left Mr. McConnell\u2019s team in the unusual position of being locked out of its account for posting a video of a threat that had been made against Mr. McConnell. The campaign appealed largely on those grounds, arguing that its intent had been \u201cto highlight the threats for public discussion,\u201d Twitter said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWe have reviewed this case more closely,\u201d the Twitter statement said. \u201cGoing forward, the video will be visible on the service with a sensitive media interstitial and only in cases where the Tweet content does not otherwise violate the Twitter Rules.\u201d As of Friday afternoon, the tweet in question was visible once again. \u201cVictory!!!\u201d the account tweeted. \u201cThank you to EVERYONE for helping #FreeMitch.\u201d The dispute over the account was first reported by The Louisville Courier-Journal. The Twitter lockout added to a turbulent week for Mr. McConnell\u2019s campaign, which drew criticism after two separate episodes involving social media, and for Mr. McConnell himself. The majority leader is recovering from a fractured shoulder and has been under pressure from Democrats and some Republicans to bring up gun control legislation in the Senate in the wake of two mass shootings that killed more than 30 people and injured dozens more. In the radio interview on Thursday, Mr. McConnell expressed a new willingness to allow the Senate to consider a measure expanding background checks for gun purchasers when lawmakers returned in September. Critics of Mr. McConnell\u2019s longtime inaction on gun control pilloried him on Twitter this week using the hashtag #MassacreMitch. That was a twist on the #MoscowMitch moniker his adversaries had developed a week earlier to chastise him for blocking election security legislation. In the video that prompted the Twitter lockout, a protester can be heard using expletives to describe the senator and suggesting that rather than injure his shoulder, Mr. McConnell \u201cshould have broken\u201d his neck. She also muses that someone or something should be stabbed in the heart. After it was shut out of its account, Mr. McConnell\u2019s campaign and some of his supporters complained vigorously that Twitter\u2019s move had set a double standard on what kind of speech was allowed. By Thursday afternoon, officials from the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee entered the fray, saying they would forgo buying new ads on Twitter until it unfroze the Team Mitch account. And by late Thursday, Mr. McConnell declared to WHAS radio in Louisville that he and his team were \u201cin a major war\u201d with Twitter and had not given up their fight. Having apparently won that fight, Kevin Golden, Mr. McConnell\u2019s campaign manager, said Friday that he and his team were pleased that Twitter had \u201creversed their decision.\u201d \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken an avalanche of outrage from across the country to stop Silicon Valley from launching an effort to silence conservatives like the majority leader of the United States Senate in the first place,\u201d Mr. Golden said in a statement. The other Twitter turmoil involving Mr. McConnell began over the weekend when the Team Mitch account posted a photo of a mock graveyard filled with faux tombs marked with the names of people and policies Mr. McConnell has opposed. (Mr. McConnell, who is running for re-election in 2020, has sometimes cast himself as the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for liberal legislation.) One of the tombstones was labeled \u201cAmy McGrath\u201d and dated Nov. 3, 2020, which is Election Day. Ms. McGrath, a Democrat and retired Marine, is challenging Mr. McConnell for his Senate seat. She criticized him for posting the photo soon after the shooting in El Paso on Saturday, and said she found it \u201ctroubling that our politics have become so nasty and personal that the Senate majority leader thinks it\u2019s appropriate to use imagery of the death of a political opponent (me) as messaging.\u201d Then on Monday, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, reposted a photo of a group of young men wearing \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d T-shirts clustered around a cardboard cutout of her. One of the young men had his hand at the cutout\u2019s neck, while another appeared to be going in for a kiss. \u201cAre you paying for young men to practice groping & choking members of Congress w/ your payroll, or is this just the standard culture of #TeamMitch?\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote in her tweet to Mr. McConnell. In a series of statements, Mr. Golden said the young men were high school students and not campaign staff members, and added that \u201cTeam Mitch in no way condones any aggressive, suggestive or demeaning act toward life-size cardboard cutouts of any gender.\u201d As for the faux graveyard, he said supporters had \u201cbuilt a homage\u201d to an editorial cartoon that appeared in The Lexington Herald-Leader earlier this year. \u201cThis is the problem with the speech police in America today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Lexington Herald can attack Mitch with cartoon tombstones of his opponents, but we can\u2019t mock it.\u201d",

      "content": " Did you hear the one about a top Trump administration official praising Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal firebrand from the Bronx? You may be waiting for a punch line. But this is not a joke. Lawrence Kudlow, director of President Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, singled out Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for praise recently \u2014 an unusual and illuminating example of people on the right and the left ganging up on an established tenet of the mainstream middle. What led to this meeting of the minds is a concept called the \u201cPhillips curve.\u201d The economist George Akerlof, a Nobel laureate and the husband of the former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, once called the Phillips curve \u201cprobably the single most important macroeconomic relationship.\u201d So it is worth recalling what the Phillips curve is, why it plays a central role in mainstream economics and why it has so many critics. The story begins in 1958, when the economist A. W. Phillips published an article reporting an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation in Britain. He reasoned that when unemployment is high, workers are easy to find, so employers hardly raise wages, if they do so at all. But when unemployment is low, employers have trouble attracting workers, so they raise wages faster. Inflation in wages soon turns into inflation in the prices of goods and services. A couple of years later, Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow \u2014 who also both went on to win the Nobel in economics \u2014 found a similar correlation between unemployment and inflation in the United States. They dubbed the relationship the \u201cPhillips curve.\u201d After its discovery, the Phillips curve could have become just a curious empirical regularity. But Mr. Samuelson and Mr. Solow suggested it was much more than that. In the years that followed, the Phillips curve came to play an important role in both macroeconomic theory and discussions of monetary policy. For centuries, economists have understood that inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon. They noticed that when the world\u2019s economies operated under a gold standard, gold discoveries resulted in higher prices for goods and services. And when central banks in economies with fiat money created large quantities \u2014 Germany in the interwar period, Zimbabwe in 2008, or Venezuela recently \u2014 the result was hyperinflation. But economists also noticed that monetary conditions affect economic activity. Gold discoveries often lead to booming economies, and central banks easing monetary policy usually stimulate production and employment, at least for a while. The Phillips curve helps explain how inflation and economic activity are related. At every moment, central bankers face a trade-off. They can stimulate production and employment at the cost of higher inflation. Or they can fight inflation at the cost of slower economic growth. Soon after the Phillips curve entered the debate, economists started to realize that this trade-off was not stable. In 1968, Milton Friedman, the economist and author, suggested that expectations of inflation could shift the Phillips curve. Once people became accustomed to high inflation, wages and prices would keep rising, even without low unemployment. Soon after Mr. Friedman hypothesized a shifting Phillips curve, his prediction came to pass, as spending on the Vietnam War stoked inflationary pressures. In the mid-1970s, the Phillips curve shifted again, this time in response to large increases in world oil prices engineered by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries \u2014 an example of a \u201csupply shock\u201d in economists\u2019 parlance. Today, most economists believe there is a trade-off between inflation and unemployment in the sense that actions taken by a central bank push these variables in opposite directions. As a corollary, they also believe there must be a minimum level of unemployment that the economy can sustain without inflation rising too high. But for various reasons, that level fluctuates and is difficult to determine. Enter Representative Ocasio-Cortez. While questioning Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, during a congressional hearing in July, she suggested that the central bank\u2019s understanding of inflation and unemployment was flawed. \u201cDo you think it is possible that the Fed\u2019s estimates of the lowest sustainable estimates for the unemployment rate may have been too high?\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez asked. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Mr. Powell replied. The sustainable unemployment rate now appears to be \u201csubstantially lower than we thought.\u201d The next day, Mr. Kudlow applauded the congresswoman\u2019s questioning. \u201cMs. AOC kind of nailed that,\u201d he said. The motives of these unlikely allies are easy to surmise. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is presumably more concerned about unemployment than about inflation. Mr. Kudlow, who serves a president running for re-election, is undoubtedly praying for a strong economy. Both interests would be served by dovish monetary policy. To some extent, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Kudlow are both right. The unemployment rate, now at 3.7 percent, is lower than the level most economists thought was possible without igniting inflation. This period is providing yet more evidence \u2014 though we didn\u2019t really need it \u2014 that the Phillips curve is unstable and, therefore, an imperfect guide for policy. But unstable does not mean nonexistent, and imperfect does not mean useless. As long as the tools of monetary policy influence both inflation and unemployment, monetary policymakers must be cognizant of the trade-off. Mr. Powell was smart to acknowledge during his congressional hearing that the Fed\u2019s track record is flawed. But the uncertainty inherent in monetary policymaking does not mean that \u201cthe single most important macroeconomic relationship\u201d can now be ignored. The Fed\u2019s job is to balance the competing risks of rising unemployment and rising inflation. Striking just the right balance is never easy. The first step, however, is to recognize that the Phillips curve is always out there lurking.",

      "content": " A Facebook post by a Louisiana police officer suggesting that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u201cneeds a round\u201d drew criticism on Sunday from officials in the city where he works. The officer, Charlie Rispoli, a 14-year veteran of the police department in Gretna, La., referred to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, in a post on Thursday as \u201cthis vile idiot.\u201d The post continued, saying she \u201cneeds a round \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean the kind she used to serve,\u201d a reference to her past work as a bartender, according to a screenshot of his comment obtained by The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. He was responding to a post by the satirical website tatersgonnatate.com with the headline \u201cOcasio-Cortez on the Budget: \u2018We Pay Soldiers Too Much.\u2019\u201d Wayne Rau, a city councilman and the mayor pro tem of Gretna, a city of about 18,000 people across the Mississippi River from New Orleans, condemned Officer Rispoli\u2019s post in an interview on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m pretty appalled by it,\u201d Mr. Rau said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a representation of the police department of the city of Gretna.\u201d Asked whether Officer Rispoli\u2019s Facebook post was a threat, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to take that post.\u201d He said it should be up to the city\u2019s police chief, Arthur Lawson, to decide on any disciplinary or criminal action. In addition to Mr. Rau, there are four other members on the Gretna City Council. Three were not immediately available for comment on Sunday. The fourth, Jackie Berthelot, directed questions to the Police Department. Efforts on Sunday to reach Officer Rispoli, who appeared to have deactivated his Facebook account, were unsuccessful. Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, declined to comment. Chief Lawson, who is an elected official, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. The chief told The Times-Picayune that he was disturbed by the post. \u201cI will tell you this: This will not go unchecked,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take this lightly and this will be dealt with on our end. It\u2019s not something we want someone that\u2019s affiliated with our department to make these types of statements. That\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d The chief said that the post appeared to violate the department\u2019s social media policy but that he did not think it rose to the level of being a threat. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is part of a quartet of first-year Democrats in the House known as \u201cthe squad\u201d who have received death threats and were told by President Trump to \u201cgo back where you came from\u201d in a racially charged post on Twitter. Belinda Constant, the mayor of Gretna, said on Sunday that she had been out of the state and was not immediately prepared to comment. \u201cI will be looking into the situation,\u201d Ms. Constant, a Democrat, said. Eva Malecki, a spokeswoman for the United States Capitol Police, declined to say whether the agency was investigating. \u201cThe mission of the United States Capitol Police is to protect and serve Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, we do not discuss how we carry out our protective responsibilities.\u201d The four congresswomen were also the subject of a recent Facebook post by the Republican County Chairmen\u2019s Association of Illinois, which depicted them in a mock movie poster that referred to them as the \u201cjihad squad.\u201d \u201cPolitical Jihad is their game,\u201d said the post, which was published on Friday and later deleted. \u201cIf you don\u2019t agree with their socialist ideology you\u2019re racist.\u201d It showed Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts brandishing guns. On Sunday night, the state\u2019s Republican Party chairman, Tim Schneider, issued a statement disavowing the post, which he said did not reflect the party\u2019s values. \u201cBigoted rhetoric greatly distracts from legitimate and important policy debates and further divides our nation,\u201d Mr. Schneider said, adding, \u201cI urge everyone who opposes them to keep the rhetoric focused on policy and ideology.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Kamala Harris of California and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on Monday unveiled legislation aimed at ensuring that climate change plans benefit low-income communities. They described the measure as a key element of the Democrats\u2019 Green New Deal. The effort comes as Ms. Harris, who is running for president, and other Democratic candidates prepare for a set of debates in Detroit this week. Racial and economic disparities on issues ranging from housing to education are expected to take center stage. [Follow our coverage of the next Democratic primary debates.] Ms. Harris, who has yet to release a comprehensive climate change plan of her own, has focused much of her economic agenda on providing tax credits and other assistance to low- and middle-income Americans. This month, she and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez introduced a bill designed to help people with criminal records obtain housing. The new proposal, titled the Climate Equity Act, provides a view of Ms. Harris\u2019s environmental priorities. Under the plan, any environmental regulation or legislation would be rated based on its impact on low-income communities, which are disproportionately affected by climate change because they are often in flood zones, near highways or power plants, or adjacent to polluted lands known as brownfields. The rating system would be modeled after the Congressional Budget Office score, which measures the costs of every major piece of legislation. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything without a C.B.O. score, but we never actually consider if it\u2019s disastrous to communities as long as it\u2019s revenue-neutral,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. The bill would also establish an independent Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability to represent vulnerable communities, and create a position of senior adviser on climate justice at \u201call relevant agencies.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was the primary House sponsor of the Green New Deal, a nonbinding resolution that set out a broad vision for significantly reducing planet-warming pollution by 2030 while also guaranteeing millions of new jobs. She said low-income workers were often ignored in the climate discussion. \u201cOne of the tenets of the Green New Deal is prioritizing vulnerable communities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to talk about Flint. We have to talk about West Virginia. We have to talk about the Bronx and we have to talk about the ways climate change manifests in our lives.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that she had not endorsed anyone in the presidential race and noted that she had worked with various candidates on different aspects of the climate challenge. Climate change analysts said they were encouraged by the bill, and by the fact that several presidential candidates had recently made issues of equity more central to their discussions of the environment. Many of the candidates\u2019 early plans for tackling global warming focused almost entirely on methods of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including by establishing a price on carbon dioxide, eliminating coal-fired power plants and investing billions of dollars in clean energy technologies. But in another example of the growing focus on economic and racial disparities, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington released the final plank of a five-part global warming plan on Monday, aimed at new federal policies to prioritize low-income areas and communities of color. Mr. Inslee, who has made climate change the top issue of his presidential campaign, also called for a way to score, or screen, federal environmental decisions and proposed a new office dedicated to environmental justice. Tom Steyer, the billionaire former hedge fund investor who also is running for president, last week released his own \u201cjustice-centered\u201d five-pillar plan for tackling climate change focused on protecting low-income communities. The new plans \u201csend an important signal,\u201d said Mustafa Ali, who ran the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s environmental justice office under the Obama administration. \u201cThey are timely and they are needed,\u201d he said, \u201cand they help us to begin to think critically about the steps that are going to be necessary to protect people\u2019s lives in the moment, and in these challenges that are rushing at us at a very quick pace.\u201d The candidates are making equity a top issue in other arenas. This month Ms. Harris has introduced a $100 billion housing plan to help black families and individuals buy homes in historically redlined communities, and a $75 billion initiative to invest in minority-owned businesses and historically black colleges. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has called for an executive order requiring recipients of federal contracts to diversify their workforces. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has proposed creating savings accounts for every child born in the United States. Ms. Harris also released her health care plan on Monday, proposing a system that would provide Medicare for all Americans but allow people to choose private plans modeled on Medicare Advantage. Ms. Harris\u2019s campaign said her full climate plan was forthcoming. But in a statement, Ms. Harris said she believed it was important to address equity even before nailing down the specifics of how to curb carbon emissions. \u201cWe cannot accept a status quo where children of color are drinking toxic water in Flint or breathing toxic air in Louisiana\u2019s Cancer Alley,\u201d she said. \u201cThis systemic environmental injustice will only get worse and become more ingrained if climate and environmental policies like the Green New Deal do not specifically focus on lifting up these communities.\u201d",

Wednesday night, a month after enough ice melted off Greenland in a single day to flood Florida with five inches of water, 10 Democratic presidential hopefuls will join CNN to discuss their plans for the climate crisis. All have gone on record supporting some version of the Green New Deal, a plan for getting every sector of the economy \u2014 electricity, transportation, agriculture, infrastructure \u2014 off fossil fuels while guaranteeing Americans health care, housing and jobs. What\u2019s actually in the Green New Deal? Catch up with this Vox video. The debate: Is the Green New Deal a left-wing wish list, a catalyst for crucial dialogue or our best hope for averting catastrophe? Mass extinction. Millions more refugees. The breakdown of the global food supply. These are just some of the calamities world leaders hoped to pre-empt in 2015 when they made a pact in Paris to try to keep the global temperature from rising this century more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and certainly well below the 2-degree threshold beyond which some damage would be irreversible. As the journalist David Wallace-Wells told the podcast \u201cLongform,\u201d a 2-degree increase risks 153 million premature deaths from air pollution alone. But four years after the agreement, temperatures are on track to rise at least 3 degrees by 2100. Last October, a United Nations report warned that the 1.5-degree target would require effectively eliminating carbon emissions by 2050, possible only through \u201crapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.\u201d Enter the Green New Deal. Seven months ago, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey introduced a nonbinding resolution to eliminate the country\u2019s carbon emissions in one decade, not three, by mobilizing \u201cevery aspect of American society at a scale not seen since World War II,\u201d in a way that would create \u201ceconomic prosperity for all.\u201d [The big debates, distilled. This guide will put in context what people are saying about the pressing issues of the week. Sign up for our new newsletter, Debatable.] The ambitious goals of the Green New Deal will require the contributions and sacrifices of millions of workers who will need to have their employment, health care and housing ensured, says Rhiana Gunn-Wright, the 29-year-old Rhodes Scholar who has been called the architect of the Green New Deal. A federal jobs guarantee, for example, secures the labor force needed to construct renewable energy projects, while unlinking health care from employment frees people to move between and for those jobs. Ms. Gunn-Wright also believes tying climate change to economic inequality is a winning political strategy. Class-blind approaches, like carbon taxes, are often regressive and can trigger public backlash (see France\u2019s Yellow Vest protests) that ends up hamstringing climate action. \u201cAny solution that is tied to tangible economic benefits is going to have a better chance of passing,\u201d she told The Times. \u201cThe war on the climate emergency, if correctly waged, would actually be good for the economy \u2014 just as the second world war set the stage for America\u2019s golden economic era,\u201d writes Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, in The Guardian. Green New Deal critics say that the plan prioritizes social justice over political reality and even science itself. The plan \u201cretreats into a political fantasy world in which the ideologically median legislator is Bernie Sanders,\u201d Jonathan Chait writes in New York magazine. He points out that the plan is mum on nuclear power, despite a vigorous debate about that technology\u2019s necessity. (Mr. Sanders\u2019s Green New Deal plan, the most ambitious of any candidate\u2019s, explicitly rejects nuclear expansion.) Mr. Chait writes: Along similar lines, The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board notes that the Green New Deal is noncommittal about a carbon tax, which many economists believe is imperative to harnessing market forces to reduce emissions. \u201cPolicymakers should focus above all else on quickly and efficiently decarbonizing,\u201d they write, \u201cand carbon pricing is still the best first-line policy.\u201d The Green New Deal suffers from domestic myopia, argues Megan McArdle, a libertarian-leaning Washington Post columnist, because the United States produces only 15 percent of the world\u2019s emissions, a share that will only shrink as developing countries industrialize. \u201cZeroing out U.S. emissions and moving the whole country into yurts wouldn\u2019t prevent the climate from warming,\u201d she writes, \u201cbecause Americans are not the biggest problem anymore.\u201d For the same reason, Noah Smith, a left-leaning Bloomberg columnist, agrees with the spirit, but not the letter, of the Green New Deal. The priority, he writes, is to \u201cpour money\u201d into researching green technology and then transferring and subsidizing it across the world: Elizabeth Kolbert, a staff writer at The New Yorker and the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of \u201cThe Sixth Extinction,\u201d has written that the amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere has most likely locked the planet into another half degree of warming. The 1.5-degree target may therefore be impossible unless emissions can be reversed. Bill Gates is among those who endorse populating the planet with facilities that suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and bury it, through a technology known as carbon capture. Construct enough such facilities and we could theoretically continue burning fossil fuels while staving off catastrophe. The prospect remains theoretical, however, because carbon capture is barely in its infancy. As Ms. Kolbert writes, \u201cthe technology represents either the ultimate insurance policy or the ultimate moral hazard\u201d: Jasper Bernes, the managing editor of the leftist magazine Commune, argues that as long as the Green New Deal is fused to the liberal framework of economic growth, it will fail. Even if it were possible to power our ever-expanding civilization with entirely renewable energy, he writes, there is still at least $50 trillion of oil wealth in the ground, and fossil fuel companies will stop at nothing to capitalize on it: During the 2000 general election campaign, the presidential debates spent a total of 14 minutes on the topic of climate change, according to Grist. During the 2016 election, that dropped to five and a half minutes. Wednesday night, even in the absence of a true debate on the issue, climate change will command seven hours of national attention. That\u2019s in no small part thanks to the Green New Deal, whose primary purpose, for now, is less policy than provocation. As Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said last February, \u201cSo people are like: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s unrealistic. Oh, it\u2019s vague. Oh, it doesn\u2019t address this little minute thing.\u2019 And I am like, \u2018You try! You do it!\u2019\u201d Ten people with ambitions to run the country will now have to take up her challenge.

What just happened: Having resisted calls for Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment on various charges since she became speaker of the House in January, Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday that the House will open a formal impeachment inquiry into the president. The disclosure that he had pressed his Ukrainian counterpart on a call to investigate unsubstantiated claims of corruption against the son of the leading Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, made it almost impossible for Ms. Pelosi to hold out. Reports that the president had frozen almost $400 million in military aid to Ukraine before the call proved decisive. \u201cTrump, Biden and Ukraine: Sorting Out the Accusations\u201d The debate: When is impeaching the president the right thing to do? The president\u2019s critics have found numerous justifications for impeachment throughout his tenure, including obstruction of justice during the Mueller investigation, violations of campaign finance laws in the payment of hush money to two women and what seems to be regular defiance of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, however, had until now been unwilling to make what she saw as a doomed commitment: While a simple majority in the House of Representatives is enough to impeach, convicting and removing the president requires the support of two-thirds of the Senate, now controlled by Republicans who show no signs of defecting. Impeachment is a process whose territory remains largely uncharted, since only two presidents, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, have ever been impeached, and neither was convicted. \u201cBecause it has been used so rarely, and because it is a power entrusted to Congress, not the courts, impeachment as a legal process is poorly understood,\u201d Noah Feldman and Jacob Weisberg have written in The New York Review of Books. \u201cThere are no judicial opinions that create precedents for how and when to proceed with it.\u201d [The big debates, distilled. This guide will put in context what people are saying about the pressing issues of the week. Sign up for our new newsletter, Debatable.] The Constitution specifies two crimes \u2014 treason and bribery \u2014 for which the president can be impeached, as well as a third, broader category of \u201cother high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d It is generally understood that to the drafters of the Constitution, the word \u201chigh\u201d referred not to the severity of a given crime but to the abuse of high office. Otherwise, though, what falls under the category of impeachable offenses is a matter that floats free from the rest of the American legal code. The slippery nature of the concept spurred Gerald Ford\u2019s famous declaration in 1970 that \u201can impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.\u201d That\u2019s true, but which offenses should Congress consider impeachable? The debate over how to answer that question revolves around a couple of hypotheticals: A crime that\u2019s not an impeachable offense? \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose voters,\u201d Mr. Trump famously said at a campaign rally during the 2016 presidential race. As it happens, an imagined scenario in which the president commits murder was raised as far back as 1789. Michael Stern, former senior counsel to the House of Representatives, writes that \u201cthere is no serious question that our murdering president could be impeached for his crime.\u201d But \u201cnot all crimes by federal officials have been seen as impeachable,\u201d write Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard, and Joshua Matz, an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law, in their book \u201cTo End a Presidency.\u201d So where exactly does the line fall? During Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial, Mr. Tribe argued that his conduct did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense because it related to his private life. But Michael Stokes Paulsen, a professor of law at the University of St. Thomas, disagrees, claiming the distinction is contrived: \u201cPerjury and obstruction of justice are serious felonies (even if somehow cast as \u2018private-capacity\u2019 wrongs),\u201d he writes. \u201cThey are not quite like gunning down a man, but they are serious wrongs against the public and the administration of justice.\u201d Ultimately, the line between an offense that\u2019s impeachable and one that\u2019s merely illegal remains just as obscure as it was during Clinton\u2019s trial. In the words of the Congressional Research Service\u2019s Constitution Annotated: An impeachable offense that\u2019s not a crime? In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s second article of impeachment against Richard Nixon alleged an abuse of power in his Watergate cover-up, a political judgment with a legal foundation. (Nixon resigned before his impeachment could be formalized.) In the case of Mr. Trump\u2019s Ukraine call, some argue that his conduct amounted to an abuse of power that likewise violated both the Constitution and criminal law. Leah Litman, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School, wrote for NBC News: Many caution that without an underlying criminal offense, like bribery, impeachment risks becoming a partisan political weapon. The argument against this sort of ad hoc impeachment has its roots in Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Curtis\u2019s defense of President Andrew Johnson during his impeachment trial in 1868. As Nikolas Bowie, an assistant professor at Harvard Law School, writes in the Harvard Law Review, Curtis believed that retroactively criminalizing a president\u2019s behavior \u2014 inflammatory, racist campaign speeches \u2014 would violate a fundamental principle of common law: \u201cThere must be some law,\u201d Curtis argued, \u201cotherwise there is no crime.\u201d Mr. Bowie argues that the decision to impeach Mr. Trump without any statutory justification would set a dangerous precedent that \u201cwould apply not just to someone as unpopular as President Trump but also to future Presidents whose policies happen to misalign with a congressional majority.\u201d \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law,\u201d Speaker Pelosi said Tuesday. But she had previously insisted that impeaching the president without the Senate votes needed for conviction would be a futile exercise. She told The Washington Post in March: But others, invoking the judgment of history, maintain that political considerations shouldn\u2019t enter the calculus. Members of Congress made an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and to look the other way when it\u2019s being violated is to abdicate that responsibility. \u201cWe have to do our job,\u201d said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an early advocate of impeaching Mr. Trump, earlier this month. She added: Others argue that the process of impeachment itself, by expanding congressional investigatory powers, can help produce the evidence the case requires. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler, for example, has said the courts would be more likely to enforce the subpoenas the Trump administration is currently defying if such legal battles were waged under the banner of impeachment. At Lawfare, Molly Reynolds and Margaret Taylor write: Still, even those who believe the current president ought to be impeached say the process carries grave risks. As Mr. Tribe and Mr. Matz write, impeachment \u201cturbocharges forces of dysfunction and despair in our democracy\u201d: One way or the other, if the option of undoing an election is on the table, something has gone very wrong. The paradox of impeachment is that it relies on a legislative body that represents the public to solve a crisis that the public helped set in motion \u2014 in some cases, one could argue, with foreknowledge of the potential for disaster. Institutions, in other words, cannot save democracy from itself. It\u2019s a problem Alexis de Tocqueville recognized almost 200 years ago. \u201cI do not say that there is a frequent use of tyranny in America at the present day,\u201d he wrote in 1835, \u201cbut I maintain that there is no sure barrier against it, and that the causes which mitigate the government there are to be found in the circumstances and the manners of the country more than in its laws.\u201d Do you have a point of view we missed?

      "author": "Emily Cochrane",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 On the first day of the 116th Congress, the strident cry of a first-term lawmaker encapsulated the fervor of the progressive left for impeaching President Trump. In a late-night speech to activists in early January, Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, promised, \u201cWe\u2019re going to impeach the\u201d president, referring to Mr. Trump with an expletive. More than eight months later, a cascade of carefully worded statements from moderate freshmen in Republican-leaning districts proved a crucial pivot point that helped drive House Democrats to officially begin an impeachment inquiry. Sixty-four Democrats were elected last year \u2014 the most ideologically and culturally diverse class in history \u2014 and since coming to Washington in January, the freshmen have personified the two poles of a divided caucus in the impeachment debate. Now the progressives who have long clamored for Mr. Trump\u2019s removal and the moderates who stubbornly resisted it have come together around the idea that it is time to pursue an impeachment inquiry. The rare bit of unity has given leverage to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has privately advised some of the freshmen about the most effective way to make their voices heard, as she undertakes a process that could bring down a president. And balancing their competing interests as the House moves ahead could prove a steep challenge. Top Democrats say it is no accident that Ms. Pelosi\u2019s head-spinning turn from opposing an impeachment inquiry to calling for one came less than 24 hours after seven first-term moderates, including military veterans and two former C.I.A. officers, embraced the idea in the opinion pages of The Washington Post on Monday night. Other moderate freshmen followed with their own carefully drafted statements. Most had strongly resisted impeachment and some have tough re-election races. \u201cIt caused other colleagues to change their minds and it signaled the gravity of the moment,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, of Rhode Island, a member of the Democratic leadership. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a coincidence that all these events happened together. As they began to call for it, it created, really, a dam breaking in our caucus.\u201d That has created a new atmosphere in the Capitol, where the moderates have spent months ducking reporter\u2019s impeachment questions, often refusing to mention the word. Eclipsed in the media by liberals like Ms. Tlaib and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, they are now taking their turn in the spotlight, forthright about their views on and off camera. \u201cI support the inquiry, and I think the transcript that came out, it\u2019s plain for anyone to see, it shows the president of the United States, both explicitly and implicitly asking a foreign leader to dig up dirt on a political opponent,\u201d declared Representative Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a former C.I.A. analyst and one of the authors of the op-ed. \u201cThat can\u2019t be O.K.\u201d Ms. Slotkin was referring to a transcript released on Wednesday of Mr. Trump\u2019s call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which has been at the center of the impeachment discussion. It showed that Mr. Trump repeatedly asked Mr. Zelensky to investigate one of the American president\u2019s rivals, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Constituting roughly a quarter of the Democratic caucus, the freshmen are a microcosm of the broader group. They span the philosophical spectrum, including Ms. Tlaib of Michigan on the left, and Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey \u2014 who on Wednesday echoed some of the arguments Republican leaders are making against impeachment \u2014 on the right. \u201cWe\u2019re fundamentally different folks, right, we\u2019re generally not career politicians, we\u2019re generally people that haven\u2019t been spending our lives within political systems trying to get here to Washington,\u201d said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and one of the seven writers behind the op-ed. \u201cBecause we come from different backgrounds, we have a unique ability right now to change culture and approach things in a very different way.\u201d Ms. Pelosi is paying especially close attention to the more than 40 freshmen who flipped Republican seats \u2014 many, but not all, in districts won by Mr. Trump. The House Republican campaign arm has reveled in the new enthusiasm for impeachment, flooding the airwaves with statements claiming that because the moderates have \u201ccaved to the impeachment-obsessed base,\u201d their political careers are over. The few Democrats who oppose impeachment, like Mr. Van Drew, can ill afford to take a vote on the House floor on whether to open an impeachment inquiry, and Ms. Pelosi does not plan to hold one, according to lawmakers and senior party officials, even though that is what Republicans did in 1998 when they opened an inquiry into President Bill Clinton. Mr. Van Drew said he has been raising that issue in calls to the speaker\u2019s office. \u201cI asked, \u2018Do you absolutely need a vote for the impeachment inquiry, for the inquiry alone?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd nobody has gotten me that information.\u201d Instead, the House voted Wednesday on a resolution demanding access to a whistle-blower complaint about Ukraine, and condemning Mr. Trump and his administration for refusing to turn it over to Congress. Hours before the vote, they did. Others, like Ms. Slotkin, are urging Ms. Pelosi to narrow the impeachment inquiry to Ukraine, and focus it tightly on national security \u2014 a message that would presumably go over well in their Trump-friendly districts. Were she to do so, the speaker might anger powerful committee chairmen who are investigating other aspects of the Trump administration. \u201cThe speaker has given each of us the freedom to come to whatever conclusion we have on our own, based on our own beliefs and our own districts,\u201d said Representative Angie Craig, who flipped a Republican seat in Minnesota. \u201cThis is one of the toughest decisions that any member of Congress will have to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not something I ever wanted to have to do.\u201d For centrists like Ms. Craig, there is clearly political peril in coming out in favor of impeachment. Only a few, including Representative Antonio Delgado, Democrat of New York, directly called for articles of impeachment over the allegations surrounding the call. Many did so with statements aimed at their constituents. Representative Haley Stevens of Michigan, one of two presidents of the freshman class, was among those who wrestled with the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s not political,\u201d she said. \u201cMy goal wasn\u2019t to move the narrative, but to speak to the gravity of the situation.\u201d At the same time, the tables have flipped for Ms. Pelosi when it comes to the liberal wing of her caucus. For months, progressive freshmen like Ms. Tlaib \u2014 a member of the foursome of freshmen women who dub themselves \u201cthe squad\u201d \u2014 have been pressuring the speaker to move on impeachment. Now, she has done what they wanted. \u201cTime\u2019s up,\u201d Ms. Tlaib declared happily on Tuesday, after Ms. Pelosi\u2019s announcement, adding, \u201cI guess it took this major action, a criminal action by the president, for a lot of my colleagues to understand. We\u2019re moving forward and I\u2019m very pleased.\u201d Veteran Democrats agree that, as a class, the freshmen have outsized power \u2014 in part because there are so many of them. Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Rules Committee, said that when he was a freshman, nobody paid attention to him. \u201cWhen they speak,\u201d Mr. McGovern said, \u201ceverybody listens.\u201d Ms. Pelosi meets monthly with the freshmen as a class, and meets with smaller groups as various issues crop up. She spoke with the seven national security lawmakers on Monday at about 5 p.m., several hours before their opinion piece posted. Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, one of the authors, said Ms. Pelosi was not told about the op-ed until it was \u201calready in the hands\u201d of editors at The Post. But the speaker was pleased to have it, those close to her say, and she was spotted reading it Tuesday morning on a plane from New York to Washington. The freshmen were short, and to the point, and hinted at their past reluctance, declaring, \u201cWe do not arrive at this conclusion lightly.\u201d The op-ed, coupled with the other statements, caught other, more veteran Democrats by surprise. Representative Mark Takano of California, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said he was especially caught off guard when he saw that Representative Elaine Luria, a low-profile Democrat from Virginia, was one of the authors. \u201cElaine\u2019s from a very tough district,\u201d Mr. Takano said. \u201cMy reaction when I heard Elaine had done that was, \u2018Oh my god, wow, this is really a watershed moment.\u2019 \u201d",

As of Saturday, 224 members of the House of Representatives said they supported an inquiry after learning that a whistle-blower\u2019s complaint accused the president of pressuring a foreign leader to investigate the family of Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate. [How the impeachment process works.] Only 12 Democrats, including Mr. Rose, were undecided on an inquiry. No Republicans supported an investigation. The following three New York City lawmakers show a cross-section of positions, and approaches, on the issue: Representative Jerry Nadler, Manhattan: As chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Nadler could play a leading role in the impeachment process. The committee conducted an impeachment inquiry hearing this month that included testimony from Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign manager. But Mr. Lewandowski refused to provide new details about his encounters with Mr. Trump. Critics said Mr. Nadler mishandled the hearing and did little to change the opinions of his colleagues, or the public, on the issue. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bronx and Queens: The freshman lawmaker has used social media, where she is followed by millions, to urge her colleagues into action on impeachment. Before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported opening an impeachment inquiry, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter: \u201cAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior \u2014 it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it.\u201d When a reporter said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was making a false equivalency, she doubled down: \u201cThe integrity of our democracy isn\u2019t threatened when a president breaks the law. It\u2019s threatened when we do nothing about it.\u201d Representative Max Rose, Staten Island and Brooklyn: The freshman lawmaker represents Richmond County \u2014 the only county in New York City that Mr. Trump won in 2016. An Army veteran, Mr. Rose unseated a Republican in 2018 by promising voters that he would stay above the partisan fray. But his stance on an impeachment inquiry could determine whether he keeps his seat. [Read more about Mr. Rose and his stance on impeachment.] On Long Island, other Democrats from swing districts, like Kathleen Rice and Tom Suozzi, said they were in favor of an inquiry. On Friday, Mr. Rose said that \u201cthe story is far from over,\u201d and that \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d would he \u201callow politics to influence my decision regarding this matter.\u201d There\u2019s good news for L train riders: Repairs on the subway line should be completed in April \u2014 three months ahead of schedule, according to Governor Cuomo. The L train has been under repair for months to fix a tunnel between Brooklyn and Manhattan that was damaged during Hurricane Sandy. Initially, the line was to be fully shut down, but at the last minute Mr. Cuomo changed course with a new plan that kept trains running, albeit less frequently on nights and weekends. He said that so far more than 48,000 feet of power and signal cables and over 6,000 feet of track are in place on the line. \u201cThis project will ultimately be a case study for how the M.T.A. needs to operate going forward,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.

It\u2019s possible that you are either celebrating the holiday or joining in by blowing a horn called a shofar, lighting candles or sharing a festive meal. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, can show you how to blow a shofar. You probably don\u2019t need advice on how to light candles. So, let\u2019s talk food. If you\u2019re like me, run to Zabar\u2019s, the New York institution beloved by locals and tourists alike. If you\u2019re more ambitious, make a few recipes from NYT Cooking.

Whisk and then fold in walnuts or raisins. Joan Nathan\u2019s Matzo Ball Soup: Many families have their preferred recipe. For this one, you\u2019ll need four large eggs, chicken or vegetable stock, a few spices and matzo meal. Mold the mixture into spheres the size of Ping-Pong balls. Bowling-ball-size matzo balls may look appetizing but probably won\u2019t cook through. Crunchy Noodle Kugel \u00e0 la Great-Aunt Martha: When done right, the top is crunchy and the interior is creamy. The secret to this recipe is to use a jellyroll pan, which allows a greater amount of surface area to brown. Soak the raisins in sherry or orange juice for a kick (and to prevent them from burning).

      "content": " Jane Fonda was arrested outside the United States Capitol on Friday as part of a climate change protest, a high-profile act of civil disobedience by the Oscar-winning actress and Vietnam War objector, who said that she planned to reprise her role every Friday for the rest of the year. Ms. Fonda, 81, was among 16 people charged with unlawfully demonstrating on the East Front of the Capitol, a misdemeanor under a Washington law prohibiting protesters from obstructing public building entrances, Capitol Police said. She had just finished speaking as part of a Fire Drill Fridays protest, the first of a weekly series of planned climate change demonstrations, when she was taken into custody at 11:50 a.m. local time. Ms. Fonda was later released on her own recognizance. With the Capitol Dome as a backdrop, Ms. Fonda said she wanted to show solidarity with young climate change strikers such as Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in an emissions-free yacht to draw attention to global warming. She said she had became inspired after reading the best-selling book \u201cOn Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal\u201d by Naomi Klein about climate change over the Labor Day weekend. \u201cWe have to ensure that the climate crisis remains front and center,\u201d Ms. Fonda said. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling that I wasn\u2019t doing enough.\u201d Ms. Fonda vowed to return to the Capitol, saying that she was moving to Washington for the next four months out of a sense of urgency and moral outrage. \u201cThe same toxic ideology that took this land from people who already lived here, that kidnapped people from Africa, turning them into slaves to work that stolen land, justified it by saying that those kidnapped and displaced people were not human beings, cut down the forests and exhausted the natural world just as it did the people \u2014 this foundational ideology is the same one that has brought us the human-driven climate change that we\u2019re facing today,\u201d she said. The arrest of Ms. Fonda, a two-time Academy Award best actress winner and fitness video siren, recalled her rebellious liberal activism during the 1960s and 1970s, for which she has received both acclaim and criticism over the decades. She had been active in the Black Panthers and started a vaudeville troupe with the fellow actor Donald Sutherland as an alternative to the U.S.O.-sponsored shows of Bob Hope for entertaining soldiers. Ms. Fonda\u2019s 1972 visit to North Vietnam, where she had urged American pilots to stop the bombings during the war, earned her the pejorative nickname \u201cHanoi Jane.\u201d Ms. Fonda, who used a microphone on Friday to address the demonstrators, said the group was trying to persuade lawmakers to support the Green New Deal, the environmental initiative proposed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, that calls for a net-zero carbon United States economy by 2050. The demonstrators also wanted to press Congress to put an end to fossil fuel exploration and to \u201cphase out\u201d fossil fuel infrastructure, said Ms. Fonda, who added that it was feasible to find fossil fuel industry workers comparable paying jobs in the renewable energy sector. Ms. Fonda faces a fine of up to $250 and up to 90 days in jail if convicted of unlawful demonstration. Her agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",

      "content": " RHINEBECK, N.Y. \u2014 Even before Peter Plavchan Sr. asked about \u201cthe exact crimes\u201d President Trump had committed to prompt his congressman to reverse course and embrace an impeachment inquiry, Representative Antonio Delgado was ready with a detailed answer. \u201cWe are literally about to embark on something that has not happened all that often in our country\u2019s history,\u201d Mr. Delgado, Democrat of New York, told Mr. Plavchan and other constituents last week in his opening remarks at a town hall-style meeting in his district. Pressed further, his voice began growing hoarse as he explained, at length, the allegations about Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine. \u201cI\u2019m endeavoring, in this space, to the best of my ability, to do whatever I can to not just fan the flame, but to figure out how to bring us through this process in a way that can very least help us emerge better for it,\u201d Mr. Delgado said. It is a difficult balance to strike, with Washington in a partisan frenzy over an impeachment inquiry that expands by the day as new revelations about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct pour out, but much of the nation is still divided over \u2014 or simply uninterested in \u2014 a process that could result in the removal of the president. Here in this politically competitive district in the Hudson Valley, which Mr. Delgado flipped last year to Democrat from Republican as part of his party\u2019s sweep to power in the House of Representatives, voters have yet to be consumed with the impeachment fever gripping the capital, and some are downright sick of the topic already. \u201cAntonio, I can\u2019t quite say you represent me,\u201d declared Mr. Plavchan, who wore a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and an American flag earring, from the front row of Mr. Delgado\u2019s town hall-style meeting. More than 100 miles south on Staten Island, Representative Max Rose, another Democrat representing a conservative-leaning district, used a gathering last week with his constituents at a Jewish community center to declare his support for the impeachment inquiry. He was greeted with a hearty round of applause as he surrendered his status as one of his party\u2019s last holdouts. Across the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in Queens the following evening, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 the progressive star who was one of her party\u2019s first and most zealous champions of impeaching Mr. Trump \u2014 elicited chuckles last week when she informed her constituents gathered in a public library that, with a formal inquiry finally underway, \u201cI\u2019m over it.\u201d The conversations that unfolded in these Democratic town hall-style meetings, with a diverse group of three freshman lawmakers in three distinct enclaves of New York, reflected the broader dialogue happening across the country. Lawmakers, who are home in their districts for a two-week congressional recess, are confronting the delicate job of explaining their stances on the impeachment process, while still addressing voters\u2019 more immediate concerns about issues like health care, climate change and infrastructure. From Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s liberal urban stronghold to Mr. Delgado\u2019s rural district, many voters appeared to be more interested in talking about regional issues than about high crimes and misdemeanors. And the lawmakers worked to make it clear that they, too, had more on their minds than the potential removal of Mr. Trump. \u201cImpeachment of this president is the short-term action that we need to take to preserve our democracy,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said, preparing to show her audience a PowerPoint presentation on her latest policy initiative. \u201cBut if we are really going to thrive as a country, we need to make long-term investments and keep our eyes on the prize of social, economic and racial justice in America.\u201d When a New Jersey woman interrupted the event to question Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s reasoning on impeachment, the freshman lawmaker calmly observed that \u201cyou and I clearly have different takeaways,\u201d and encouraged attendees to read the documents released by the White House and draw their own conclusions. But pressed on her public disagreements with other Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez assured those present that, \u201cin this moment, there is nothing that is going to shake the unity of the Democratic Party in impeaching the president of the United States.\u201d Party leaders had rebuffed calls to postpone congressional recess, arguing that even amid an avalanche of support for the inquiry, it was important for lawmakers to return home and explain their positions. The House Republican campaign arm heralded each event in moderate or conservative-leaning districts with an \u201cimpeachment advisory,\u201d a warning sign for Democrats who were already well aware of the risk of an impeachment backlash from their constituents. After Mr. Rose\u2019s announcement on Wednesday, a spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee deemed his backing for an impeachment investigation \u201cpolitical suicide.\u201d Voters at each lawmaker\u2019s event last week professed some knowledge of the impeachment obsession that has gripped Washington in recent days, and particularly at Mr. Rose\u2019s town hall-style meeting, there was widespread curiosity about what had prompted a turnabout in favor of opening the inquiry. But the three lawmakers each faced more questions about their policy platforms and how they were going to maneuver legislation through a gridlocked Congress. Carol A. Oliva, a retired elementary schoolteacher who had been keeping track of which lawmakers had endorsed an impeachment inquiry, said it was no mystery to her why her congressman, Mr. Rose, had stayed silent for so long. \u201cI kind of understand why \u2014 politically, it may not be good for them,\u201d she said before his public event last week. But when Mr. Rose stood onstage minutes later to offer a fiery endorsement of the inquiry, Ms. Oliva\u2019s tufts of sprayed pink hair could be visible among the dozen or so voters who leapt to their feet to show their appreciation. For Mr. Rose, there was only one critical outburst during his impeachment announcement \u2014 from a New Jersey community organizer, who brought pamphlets from the pro-Trump LaRouche PAC \u2014 that was quickly hushed by the majority of the crowd. None of the questions selected and read aloud by the moderator addressed the impeachment inquiry, though Mr. Rose ended the event by noting that the reporters present were likely readying to ask about \u201cthe big \u2018i\u2019 word.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad he said it, and that we were able to hear it in person, rather than read it tomorrow in the newspaper \u2014 it\u2019s just, you feel like you\u2019re part of something,\u201d said Sharon Weerth, 70, a retired school secretary, standing outside Mr. Rose\u2019s town hall-style meeting. But most of the questions, Ms. Weerth noted, were about \u201cquality-of-life issues\" about their \"forgotten borough,\u201d stymied by tolls and a lengthy commute into the city. That was also the case for Mr. Delgado, who fielded only one impeachment question \u2014 from Mr. Plavchan \u2014 during his 70-minute town hall-style meeting in New York last week. \u201cThere are so many issues besides the Trump issue \u2014 which is certainly a major issue \u2014 but there are so many other issues that I want to get his feelings about,\u201d Roberta Brodie, who attended, said of Mr. Delgado, her congressman. \u201cI want to see Congress \u2014 the House and the Senate \u2014 do their jobs.\u201d",

      "content": " [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is calling for a government bailout for New York taxi drivers, emerging as the most prominent voice to back a financial rescue plan for thousands of drivers who were channeled into exploitative loans. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who said her district in the Bronx and Queens is home to many cabdrivers, jumped into a debate over how to help drivers who were urged to take out loans with high fees, interest-only payments and other one-sided terms. They borrowed the money to buy taxi medallions, the city permit that allowed them to own and operate their cabs. \u201cThis is manufactured financial indentured servitude,\u201d she said during a congressional hearing on lending on Thursday. \u201cAnd it is wrong. We need to bail out these drivers.\u201d Two other Democrats from New York, Representatives Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez and Carolyn B. Maloney, also decried the loans in the meeting, the first congressional hearing to address the driver debt crisis since it was revealed by a New York Times series. The Times reported this year that a handful of New York taxi industry leaders had made hundreds of millions of dollars by artificially inflating medallion prices and issuing reckless loans to thousands of immigrant drivers. As regulators stood by, medallion prices soared above $1 million before the bubble burst in late 2014, rocking the industry. More than 950 New York cabdrivers have filed for bankruptcy, and thousands more are struggling to hang on, The Times found. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the New York State attorney general\u2019s office are investigating the lending practices, and the city is taking steps to hold the industry leaders accountable. Those leaders have denied wrongdoing, blaming woes in the industry on ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft. Lawmakers have also drafted new rules to help prevent abusive practices and created a task force to discuss the taxi crisis. But a schism has emerged among some city officials over a government bailout of drivers. Some say the city bears partial responsibility for the crisis because regulators encouraged the buying frenzy. Others, including Mayor Bill de Blasio, say a bailout would be too expensive. The mayor\u2019s office has said a bailout could cost as much as $13 billion. Others put the cost as low as $300 million under a possible hybrid solution that would provide government assistance, but also require lenders to forgive some of the debt. A spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. New York City\u2019s congressional delegation, along with the City Council, has taken a leading role in pushing for at least a partial bailout. In July, Ms. Vel\u00e1zquez and nine other members of the delegation sent a letter calling for the task force to discuss a bailout. Last month, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and 10 other members sent a letter asking several federal regulatory agencies to provide information on how they plan to protect cabdrivers. At the hearing on Thursday, Ms. Maloney called for the federal agencies that now hold some of the loans to stop foreclosing on borrowers. \u201cAfter years of predatory loans and inflated medallion prices, the yellow cabs of New York really turned into financial traps for thousands of mostly immigrant drivers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a New York City scandal, really.\u201d Ms. Vel\u00e1zquez said that in response to the Times series, she was preparing legislation to strengthen protections and disclosures in small business loans. Bhairavi Desai, the head of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents both drivers who own medallions and those who work for fleets, attended the hearing in Washington with 15 drivers. She said she believed that a bailout was increasingly possible. Ms. Desai, a member of the task force, also said she hoped that a bailout plan was among the recommendations set to be released early next year. Several City Council members who have urged a bailout said they were encouraged by the support from Washington. \u201cThere is growing momentum behind our push for the city to buy or guarantee these wildly inflated mortgages so that they can finally be refinanced on fair terms,\u201d said Mark Levine, a city councilman in Manhattan. \u201cA consensus is emerging that this would be far less costly than the ridiculous multibillion dollar estimates that have been thrown around. Having the congressional spotlight shine on this crisis is a huge boost to our efforts.\u201d",

      "author": "Julius Krein",
      "content": " Just a few years ago, the phrase \u201cindustrial policy\u201d was employed mainly as a term of abuse. Economists almost universally insisted that state interventions to improve competitiveness, prioritize investment in strategic sectors and structure market incentives around political goals were backward policies doomed to failure \u2014 whether applied in America, Asia or anywhere in between. The political consensus that had prevailed since Ronald Reagan, across both Republican and Democratic administrations, favored free markets, trade liberalization and deregulated finance. Bill Clinton, for instance, reduced trade barriers and the regulatory structure around finance as enthusiastically as both Bush administrations. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, however, the Reagan-Bush-Clinton neoliberal consensus seems intellectually and politically bankrupt. Party \u201cestablishments\u201d appear incapable of proposing, much less advancing, policies sufficient to address major economic challenges. And the Trump administration has pursued a mostly incoherent and so far ineffective combination of tax cuts and tariffs. But now a growing number of politicians and intellectuals \u2014 left and right, \u201cpopulist\u201d and \u201cestablishment,\u201d from Senator Marco Rubio to Senator Elizabeth Warren, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Senator Josh Hawley \u2014 are finding common ground under the banner of industrial policy. Even the typically neoliberal Financial Times editorial board recently argued in favor of industrial policy, calling on the United States to \u201cdrop concerns around state planning.\u201d Why now? The United States has essentially experienced two lost decades, and inequality has reached Gilded Age levels. Productivity growth has stagnated, and trade deficits in advanced technology products continue to widen. The \u201cinformation economy\u201d job of the future has turned out to be driving an Uber, along with other poorly paid, precarious, low-value-added service jobs. The growth of the financial sector has done little to encourage productive investment in the real economy, and the short-term financial engineering it facilitates has inflated catastrophic asset bubbles. The deindustrialization of the United States has now proceeded to such an extent that even critical defense sectors are compromised. From submarines and aircraft to medicine, the military is dependent on foreign supply chains, including those running through geopolitical rivals. In telecommunications, China essentially won the 5G race, and recent efforts to discourage allies from buying Huawei network components have been rebuffed on multiple occasions. America is also at risk of being leapfrogged by China in key areas like A.I. and quantum computing. These problems will not be solved by tariffs alone or related proposals like a market access charge on foreign capital. In the first place, foreign central banks can easily retaliate against these measures through currency manipulation or other means. More fundamentally, United States industry is losing ground to foreign competitors on price, quality and technology. In many areas, our manufacturing capacity cannot compete with what exists in Asia, and more and more research and development funding is flowing to China. A successful American industrial policy would draw on replicable foreign models as well as take lessons from our history. Some simple first steps would be to update the Small Business Investment Company and Small Business Innovation Research programs \u2014 which played a role in catalyzing Silicon Valley decades ago \u2014 to focus more on domestic hardware businesses. The upcoming reauthorization of the Small Business Administration offers a chance to make changes along these lines. Government agencies could also step in to seed investment funds focused on strategic industries and to incentivize commercial lending to key sectors, policies that have proven successful in other countries (including in Canada, Britain, Israel, South Korea, China, Taiwan and Singapore). The federal government should also be spending more on basic research, which has declined significantly in recent decades as a percentage of gross domestic product. Already too much of basic research funding effectively functions as a subsidy for other countries. Because of a lack of scale-up funding or technical capacity or both, many inventions cannot be produced in the United States. Too often, the most promising ideas migrate to Asia, where the factories and, increasingly, the engineering talent and funding for non-software companies are. So the United States needs to invest more in applied research, perhaps borrowing from Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer Institutes. Elizabeth Warren has also proposed a government-sponsored research and licensing model for the pharmaceutical industry, which could be applied to other industries as well. More ambitiously, Timothy Meyer and Ganesh Sitaraman of Vanderbilt Law School have proposed a large-scale reorganization of federal agencies, bringing domestic development, trade and export promotion under one Department of Economic Growth and Security, which would focus on both domestic economic policy and international competition. Ms. Warren has embraced a version of this idea. Similarly, Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, has called for the creation of a National Institute of Manufacturing, taking inspiration from the National Institutes of Health. As America falls behind in key technologies, we may also have to use defense procurement, along with other carrots and sticks, to mobilize companies to compete in strategic sectors, such as 5G. America has a long and successful history of employing this sort of robust industrial policy. In addition to improving competitiveness and productivity growth, industrial policy may be the only way to meaningfully increase economic opportunities for struggling regions and populations. More generally, during the last several decades, the benefits of productivity gains have mostly accrued to the largest capital holders. A successful industrial policy would aim to strengthen worker bargaining power while organizing and training a better skilled labor force. Industrial policy also involves, and even depends upon, rebuilding infrastructure. Most debates concerning industrial policy have so far occurred within, rather than between, political parties. But as the issue gains prominence within both parties, differences over the priorities and content of industrial policy can be expected to fall along partisan lines. The right will be likely to prioritize technological competition and securing the defense industrial base. The left is likely to emphasize wages, environmental sustainability and using industrial policy to alter the \u201cprimary distribution\u201d of wealth \u2014 rather than relying solely on secondary redistribution through taxes and transfers while leaving basic neoliberal structures intact \u2014 as can be seen in the Green New Deal. Just as Republicans and Democrats in the Bush-Clinton era had intense debates over issues like marginal tax rates, all the while advancing an underlying neoliberal agenda, so will future debates play out in an era of renewed industrial policy. Uniting both sides will be a desire to revitalize domestic industry and to use the state to ensure that the economy serves a broader set of stakeholders and public interests rather than only large shareholders. Perhaps more important than any partisan debates will be the position of the corporate sector. There is no industrial policy without industry, after all, and this is especially true given the oligarchic character of American politics. For several decades, business leaders have been indoctrinated to believe that success is simply a matter of maximizing short-term profits for shareholders. Corporate America and its lobbyists have prioritized labor arbitrage over innovation and productivity, share buybacks over investment. But as the disappointing economic performance of the last several years demonstrates, especially the failure of the staggering 2017 tax cuts to stimulate growth and investment, that model is exhausted. Business leaders are slowly beginning to recognize that they have more to gain from greater state support of domestic industry, as well as from a stronger and more stable labor force with greater spending power. As a recent report from Mr. Rubio\u2019s office makes clear, \u201cthe U.S. cannot escape or avoid decisions about industrial policy.\u201d Refusal to consciously pursue a serious industrial policy simply means accepting a counterproductive one \u2014 and an economy shaped by the industrial policies of others. After decades of economic mismanagement, prominent figures in both parties are finally awakening to this reality, and a new consensus on the need for a strong industrial policy is beginning to emerge.",

      "content": "  At a crowded town-hall-style meeting hosted in Queens on Thursday by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a young woman stood up and began addressing the climate crisis. But her pleas took an abrupt turn for the absurd. \u201cYour next campaign slogan has to be this,\u201d she said, removing her jacket to reveal a T-shirt that said, \u201cSave the Planet, Eat the Children.\u201d \u201cWe got to start eating babies,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThere\u2019s too much CO2. All of you, you know, you\u2019re a pollutant.\u201d Was the woman serious? Was she ill? Was this an act? The answer to the latter question appears to be known: A fringe activist group, the Lyndon LaRouche Political Action Committee, took credit for the stunt on Twitter, saying, \u201cIt was us,\u201d and \u201csometimes, only satire works.\u201d Nonetheless, the moment \u2014 and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s measured response \u2014 sparked a debate that ricocheted around the internet, with #EattheBabies trending on Twitter. Why didn\u2019t she denounce a plan to eat babies? Did she really have to? On Thursday night, President Trump pointed his Twitter followers to the exchange and called the congresswoman \u201ca Wack Job!\u201d She replied, \u201cBetter than being a criminal who betrays our country.\u201d What has been immediately clear since her election last year is that practically anywhere Ms. Ocasio-Cortez goes, attention is paid. That was especially true for Thursday\u2019s meeting, inside the Queens Public Library in Corona. The Democratic congresswoman represents parts of Queens and the Bronx. Congress members regularly have these types of events with little fanfare. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s was different: It was packed with constituents, reporters and at least one television camera, carrying the event live on C-Span. In other words, it was the perfect stage for a performance. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez stood in the front of the room with her head tilted, as if listening intently. Organizers eventually began to gather around the speaker, presumably to end her diatribe. Still, the woman implored Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, \u201cThis is very serious. Please give a response.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, whose progressive activism and support for the Green New Deal helped make her a target of right-wing provocateurs, replied earnestly. \u201cWe need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. She added: \u201cIf we act in a positive way, there is space for hope. We are never beyond hope.\u201d The audience applauded and the woman was led out of the event. LaRouche supporters do not believe climate science, and are backers of Mr. Trump\u2019s skeptical approach on the topic. On Friday, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez returned to the topic, writing on Twitter that the woman was a \u201cTrump supporter,\u201d adding that her political affiliation did not rule out a \u201cpotential mental issue (Drs do that) but good to know they were not in crisis. Earlier this year I was stalked & very nearly hurt by a disturbed person. I don\u2019t take chances & immediately try to de-escalate.\u201d",

In a brief series of tweets, Ocasio-Cortez made the case against the Electoral College and argued for a national popular vote to choose the president. \u201cEvery vote should be = in America, no matter who you are or where you come from,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe right thing to do is establish a Popular Vote. & GOP will do everything they can to fight it.\u201d Crenshaw, who has sparred with Ocasio-Cortez before, jumped in with a response: \u201cAbolishing the Electoral College means that politicians will only campaign in (and listen to) urban areas. That is not a representative democracy.\u201d And then he said it: \u201cWe live in a republic, which means 51% of the population doesn\u2019t get to boss around the other 49%.\u201d [Jamelle Bouie answered your questions about this column on Twitter.] Crenshaw is wrong on the impact of ending the Electoral College. A presidential candidate who focused only on America\u2019s cities and urban centers would lose \u2014 there just aren\u2019t enough votes. Republicans live in cities just as Democrats live in rural areas. Under a popular vote, candidates would still have to build national coalitions across demographic and geographic lines. The difference is that those coalitions would involve every region of the country instead of a handful of competitive states in the Rust Belt and parts of the South. But the crux of Crenshaw\u2019s argument is his second point. \u201cWe live in a republic.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say \u201cnot a democracy,\u201d but it\u2019s implied by the next clause, where he rejects majority rule \u2014 \u201c51% of the population doesn\u2019t get to boss around the other 49%.\u201d [Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing, culture and ideas from around the internet. For exclusive thoughts, photos and reading recommendations, sign up for his newsletter.] You can fill in the blanks of the argument from there. The Founding Fathers built a government to stymie the \u201ctyranny of the majority.\u201d They contrasted their \u201crepublic\u201d with \u201cdemocracy,\u201d which they condemned as dangerous and unstable. As John Adams wrote in an 1814 letter to the Virginia politician John Taylor: \u201cDemocracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself. There never was a Democracy Yet, that did not commit suicide.\u201d But there\u2019s a problem. For the founders, \u201cdemocracy\u201d did not mean majority rule in a system of representation. The men who led the revolution and devised the Constitution were immersed in classical literature and political theory. Ancient Greece, in particular, was a cautionary tale. When James Madison critiqued \u201cdemocracy\u201d in Federalist No. 10, he meant the Athenian sort: \u201ca society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person.\u201d This he contrasted with a \u201crepublic\u201d or \u201ca government in which the scheme of representation takes place.\u201d Likewise, in a 1788 speech to the New York ratification convention, Alexander Hamilton disavowed \u201cthe ancient democracies in which the people themselves deliberated.\u201d They \u201cnever possessed one good feature of government,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir very character was tyranny; their figure deformity.\u201d In more modern terms, the founders feared \u201cdirect democracy\u201d and accounted for its dangers with a system of \u201crepresentative democracy.\u201d Yes, this \u201crepublic\u201d had counter-majoritarian aspects, like equal representation of states in the Senate, the presidential veto and the Supreme Court. But it was not designed for minority rule. Virtually everything was geared toward producing representative majorities that could govern on behalf of the country \u2014 to diminish \u201cfaction\u201d in favor of consensus. And in the case of the Electoral College, the point wasn\u2019t to stymie majorities but to provide a way to find a competent and popular chief executive in a large nation of parochial states. It\u2019s worth asking where this quip \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re a republic, not a democracy\u201d \u2014 even came from. Nicole Hemmer, a historian of American politics and the author of \u201cMessengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics,\u201d traces it to the 1930s and 40s. \u201cWhen Franklin Roosevelt made defending democracy a core component of his argument for preparing for, and then intervening in, the war in Europe, opponents of U.S. intervention began to push back by arguing that the U.S. was not, in fact, a democracy,\u201d she wrote in an email. One Roosevelt opponent, for example \u2014 Boake Carter, a newspaper columnist who supported the America First Committee (which opposed American entry into World War II) \u2014 wrote a column in October 1940 called \u201cA Republic Not a Democracy,\u201d in which he strongly rebuked the president for using the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d to describe the country. \u201cThe United States was never a democracy, isn\u2019t a democracy, and I hope it will never be a democracy,\u201d Carter wrote. The term went from conservative complaint to right-wing slogan in the 1960s, when Robert Welch, the founder of the John Birch Society, used it in a September 1961 speech, \u201cRepublics and Democracies.\u201d In a democracy, Welch protested, \u201cthere is a centralization of governmental power in a simple majority. And that, visibly, is the system of government which the enemies of our republic are seeking to impose on us today.\u201d \u201cThis is a Republic, not a Democracy,\u201d Welch said in conclusion, \u201cLet\u2019s keep it that way!\u201d These origins are important. If there\u2019s substance behind \u201cWe\u2019re a republic, not a democracy,\u201d it\u2019s not as a description of American government. There\u2019s really no difference, in the present, between a \u201crepublic\u201d and a \u201cdemocracy\u201d: Both connote systems of representation in which sovereignty and authority derive from the public at large. The point of the slogan isn\u2019t to describe who we are, but to claim and co-opt the founding for right-wing politics \u2014 to naturalize political inequality and make it the proper order of things. What lies behind that quip, in other words, is an impulse against democratic representation. It is part and parcel of the drive to make American government a closed domain for a select, privileged few.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plans on Tuesday to announce her endorsement of Marie Newman, a progressive candidate seeking to oust Representative Daniel Lipinski, a conservative-leaning Illinois Democrat, marking her first move of the 2020 campaign cycle to back a primary challenger to an incumbent. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s high-profile support amounts to a powerful seal of approval, telegraphed to her legions of ardent liberal fans, on behalf of Ms. Newman, and a reflection of the zeal of the party\u2019s progressive left to leverage its nascent power to continue targeting sitting Democrats. Ms. Newman is backed by Justice Democrats, the group that propelled Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s insurgent campaign and upset victory last year over a veteran Democratic congressman who she argued was out of step with his constituents. A businesswoman who has described herself as \u201ca real Democrat,\u201d Ms. Newman also ran in 2018 against Mr. Lipinski and lost by about 2,000 votes. \u201cMarie Newman is a textbook example of one of the ways that we could be better as a party \u2014 to come from a deep blue seat and to be championing all the issues we need to be championing,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. Of Mr. Lipinski, she said: \u201cThe fact that a deep blue seat is advocating for many parts of the Republican agenda is extremely problematic. We\u2019re not talking about a swing state that is being forced to take tough votes.\u201d Mr. Lipinski, 53, bills himself in his campaign ads as \u201ca workhorse, not a show horse,\u201d and the eight-term congressman, who opposes abortion rights and voted against the Affordable Care Act, has repeatedly expressed his concerns that it is \u201cdetrimental\u201d for the party to push out conservative lawmakers. He succeeded his father, William O. Lipinski, who held the seat for more than two decades before the younger Mr. Lipinski was elected in 2004. The incumbent shot back in a statement Tuesday that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement \u201cmakes crystal clear that Ms. Newman is an extreme candidate,\u201d and added that his constituents \u201cdo not want to be represented by a fifth member of \u2018the squad,\u2019\u201d a nickname for the quartet of progressive female lawmakers in the House that includes Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Ms. Newman, 55, a supporter of abortion rights who founded a consulting business, argues that the incumbent congressman is far more conservative than the district, a swath that includes the southwestern suburbs of Chicago. \u201cThis campaign is about putting someone in place that is in alignment directly with the district on issues like affordability for the middle class and working families, the Green New Deal,\u201d Ms. Newman said in an interview on Monday, adding that she and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u201cshare some very similar values.\u201d But the move also reflects a careful political calculus by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Bronx Democrat. She came to Congress vowing to take down any Democrat she considered insufficiently progressive, but has, until now, refrained from taking on any of her fellow incumbents directly. In challenging Mr. Lipinski, she is targeting an incumbent Democrat, but one who has broken sharply with party orthodoxy, and has already lost the support of some of his other Democratic colleagues. The House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm in April formally broke committee business ties with political consultants and pollsters who sign on to work for primary challengers, infuriating progressive Democrats. The blacklist, Ms. Newman said, \u201cwas a very expensive issue for a while on my campaign.\u201d Progressive groups and lawmakers, however, have still flocked to support Ms. Newman. Representative Ro Khanna of California, and two Illinois lawmakers, Representative Jan Schakowsky and then-Representative Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez, broke with party leadership in 2018 to endorse Ms. Newman, and Mr. Khanna renewed his endorsement this year. Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chairwoman of House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, canceled a fund-raiser in support of Mr. Lipinski in May after facing a backlash from the left. Ms. Newman has also won the support of two candidates in the Democratic presidential primary, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Ms. Warren last week announced twin endorsements of Justice Democrats candidates, backing both Ms. Newman and Jessica Cisneros, who is challenging Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas. Ms. Cisneros, who was recruited to run against Mr. Cuellar by Justice Democrats and is described by some as the next Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, has yet to win the endorsement of any sitting House Democrat. \u201cWe are so proud that Marie Newman is the first Justice Democrat of this cycle to receive an endorsement from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats. \u201cThe momentum is growing in our movement to make the Democratic Party fight for solutions as big as the problems we face and create a party that fights for its voters, not corporate donors.\u201d Until this week, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had largely focused on helping incumbent freshmen lawmakers, like Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado, a well-liked freshman and member of Democratic leadership whom she will support at a fund-raiser in Boulder this week. In April, she rallied around some of her colleagues who flipped districts President Trump won in 2016, encouraging her Twitter followers to donate to their campaigns. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that she would continue to assess whether she would weigh in on other primary challenges, but that she had no interest in intervening in competitive races that could tip the balance of power in the House. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to make these changes, they need to come from safe blue seats,\u201d she said.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Less than two weeks after being sworn in last year, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a young progressive star fresh off an upset of one of the top Democratic leaders in the House, put her fellow Democrats on notice that she would soon be coming for them, too. Appearing in a promotional video for Justice Democrats \u2014 the insurgent liberal group dedicated to unseating entrenched Democratic lawmakers that helped sweep her to power \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Bronx firebrand, urged her supporters to recruit candidates to run against her new colleagues. She was flanked by the group\u2019s three founders, two of whom had just taken top jobs in her office. There were even whispers that she might try to oust Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a rising star regarded by many Democrats as a future speaker. But after nearly nine months, with her eyes now wide open to the downsides of her revolutionary reputation and social media fame, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has tempered her brash, institution-be-damned style with something different: a careful political calculus that adheres more closely to the unwritten rules of Washington she once disdained. \u201cI think I have more of a context of what it takes to do this job and survive on a day-to-day basis in a culture that is inherently hostile to people like me,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. Gone from her Washington office are her original chief of staff and her communications director, two Justice Democrats founders who were intent on waging their divisive brand of politics from their offices on Capitol Hill. No longer an unabashed ambassador of the combative group, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has carefully managed her involvement with it. And she never did go after Mr. Jeffries, now the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, the same position held last year by Representative Joseph Crowley when Ms. Ocasio-Cortez set her sights on ousting him. Instead,  she announced on Tuesday that her first endorsement of a primary challenger to an incumbent Democrat would be Marie Newman, who is making a second run at ousting Representative Daniel Lipinski of Illinois, a conservative-leaning Democrat who is regarded by many of his colleagues as something of an outlier because of his opposition to abortion rights and his vote against the Affordable Care Act. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is not the only Democrat to break with Mr. Lipinski and support Ms. Newman, nor is she the first. Deciding on the endorsement, she said, was in part a product of having learned to balance her twin roles as a dissident and a member of Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being an activist,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cIt forces you to grow. So it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t endorse activists, but it also requires an assessment for a capacity of growth and how you navigate a space like this.\u201d When she first arrived on Capitol Hill, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her team made it clear they planned to use their perch inside Congress as a platform for their divisive, outsider brand of politics. On her first day of orientation, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez joined protesters camped outside Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office agitating for the Green New Deal. \u201cIt could have made people mad; they could have put me on the dog walking committee,\u201d she joked later that week on a Justice Democrats conference call promoting the organization\u2019s candidate recruitment campaign. \u201cThey still might.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez may have meant it as an offhand quip, but her comment underscored a reality on Capitol Hill that she and her team were slow to fully appreciate: the extent to which power and the ability to get things done in the House were dependent on personal relationships and respect for the hierarchy. The first-term congresswoman enjoys rich public support outside Congress, particularly on the social media platforms where progressive activism thrives. But the approach that she and her cohorts champion \u2014 pulling the institution to the left in part by threatening the careers of any Democrats who fail to embrace their ideas \u2014 quickly alienated many of her colleagues, and has made it difficult for her to get anything done. In private conversations, many of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Democratic colleagues routinely complain that in her zeal to build her social media celebrity and political brand, she is too quick to cast aspersions on her fellow lawmakers, painting them as apologists for the status quo. \u201cIn many ways, I feel like I walk around with a scarlet letter because many members who just have any primary, whether I know about it or not, tend to project that onto me,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. \u201cIn many ways, I feel like I walk through that body as a symbol of someone who should not be there and a threat to the way power is organized.\u201d She said she has gone through a \u201closs of innocence and na\u00efvet\u00e9,\u201d realizing that it was impossible to separate the legislative work of serving in Congress with the politics of re-election campaigns. \u201cThey are frankly much closer in that dynamic and much closer in overlapping than a lot of people tend to realize,\u201d she said. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has cut back on her appearances on behalf of Justice Democrats and has begun bolstering her fellow incumbent freshman lawmakers, like Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado, a member of Democratic leadership whom she is joining at a fund-raiser this week for the Boulder County Democratic Party. In April, she rallied around some of her colleagues who flipped districts President Trump won in 2016, encouraging her Twitter followers to donate to their campaigns. She diligently reached out to the so-called majority-makers on her committees \u2014 the centrist freshmen who flipped Republican-leaning seats \u2014 to win them over. Her aides, however, continued to carry the Justice Democrats\u2019 flag without restraint, tweeting out their support when the group challenged incumbents, to the dismay of Democratic aides and lawmakers. In July, Saikat Chakrabarti, then her chief of staff, ignited a firestorm by accusing centrist Democrats of enabling \u201ca racist system\u201d after they blocked an effort to defund immigration enforcement as part of an emergency border aid package. In a tweet, now deleted, he compared them to \u201cnew Southern Democrats,\u201d a reference to segregationists. It was a remarkable breach of protocol for an unelected aide. Mr. Jeffries used the House Democrats\u2019 official Twitter account to deliver a biting warning shot in a tweet, also now deleted, that singled out Mr. Chakrabarti. Two weeks later, Mr. Chakrabarti announced he would leave the office. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s new chief of staff, Ariel Eckblad, a former aide to Senator Kamala Harris of California, is well versed in the workings of Capitol Hill and is widely seen as a sober-minded replacement. Corbin Trent, who had been handling communications for both Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign and her congressional office, a highly unusual arrangement, has returned to the political side. The rift was an escalation of a feud that began days earlier when Maureen Dowd, a columnist for The New York Times, asked Ms. Pelosi about the fury from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and three other progressive freshmen over the border aid package. The speaker noted that the group had failed to persuade any other Democrats to join them in voting against the House\u2019s version of the bill. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said then. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people, and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez fired back by saying that it was she and the progressive activists who revere her, not Ms. Pelosi, who wielded the real power in the party, and later complained about  the speaker\u2019s \u201csingling out of newly elected women of color.\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti followed up with a tweet questioning the speaker\u2019s leadership. The break ultimately led to a private, one-on-one meeting last month with Ms. Pelosi in the speaker\u2019s office, where Ms. Ocasio-Cortez appeared ready to call a truce, telling reporters, \u201cI think the speaker respects the fact that we\u2019re coming together as a party and a community.\u201d \u201cVery rarely does a member enter the House and exit the House as the same person,\u201d said former Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York. In freshman orientation, Mr. Israel said, representatives are asked what kind of member they want to be: an activist, a policy wonk, a political leader. \u201cYou have to grapple with choosing a lane,\u201d he said, \u201cand very often, you end up shifting lanes.\u201d But Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has never been interested in staying in just one lane. \u201cNavigating her role as a legislator and a movement builder is basically what her career is about,\u201d Mr. Shahid said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to have that theory of change with one foot in D.C. and one foot in the movement. It\u2019s really hard to do that.\u201d For Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the process continues to be bumpy. Even with Ms. Eckblad at the helm, her office still operates in some ways more like an upstart campaign on a shoestring budget than like a congressional office. A replacement for Mr. Trent has yet to be hired, and another aide who routinely irritates rank-and-file aides and lawmakers with combative comments \u2014 like when he claimed his fellow congressional aides were elitist \u201ccareerists\u201d \u2014 is still in place. And while it is not clear how many more Justice Democrats Ms. Ocasio-Cortez will endorse, she said she was still \u201cvery wedded\u201d to the insurgent theory of change that propelled her to Congress. \u201cChange by nature takes friction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of how we move through it.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For a House freshman and political neophyte, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has proved to be remarkably adept at shaping the debate on her Democratic Party\u2019s left flank, boosting the visibility of single-payer health care through her support of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and elevating climate change with her Green New Deal. On Wednesday, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez hopes to do for the nation\u2019s poor what she has done with health care and climate politics with the unveiling of an ambitious anti-poverty package that, among other things, would cap annual rent increases, ensure full access to social welfare programs for people with convictions and undocumented immigrants, pressure federal contractors to offer better wages and benefits, and update official poverty measurements by taking into account geographic cost-of-living variations and access to health insurance, child care, and \u201cnew necessities\u201d such as internet access. \u201cI think this really starts to approach, head on, economic injustice in America,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. \u201cWe are at our richest point that we\u2019ve ever been, but we\u2019ve also been our most unequal.\u201d She added, \u201cit\u2019s something that we have to talk about.\u201d Since defeating Representative Joe Crowley, a senior member of the Democratic leadership, during the 2018 primaries, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, has used her social-media following \u2014 4 million followers on Instagram and more than 5 million on Twitter \u2014 and strong ties to the party\u2019s progressive wing to shift the party leftward. Her Green New Deal would move the nation\u2019s energy economy rapidly away from fossil fuels, with vague promises of guaranteed job security. Medicare for all would replace all private insurance with one government-run health care system like Britain\u2019s or Canada\u2019s. Such ideas would have once been dismissed as fringe initiatives on the far left, but many members of Congress and Democratic presidential candidates have rushed to embrace them, seeking the approval of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her supporters. \u201cShe\u2019s a lightning rod,\u201d said Dianne Enriquez, a director at the Center for Popular Democracy, a liberal advocacy group. \u201cI think the boldness, the ability to be innovative, the willingness to go out on a limb for what she believes is right is really what makes her an ideal champion for a lot of the issues that have gone largely ignored at the federal level.\u201d Establishment Democrats have worried that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez have moved the conversation too far to the left too fast, becoming the policy face of the party and jeopardizing the political futures of more moderate members elected last year in Republican-leaning districts. But in recent weeks, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has pushed out her chief of staff, who had picked fights with moderate Democrats, and moved her combative communications director to her campaign. Unlike the Green New Deal, which is a gauzy congressional resolution, her anti-poverty initiative, \u201cA Just Society,\u201d is six fully formed bills, written in legislative language \u2014 another sign of serious legislative intent. She had good reason to make overtures to fellow House Democrats, who had grown weary of her staff\u2019s antagonism. Matt Bennett, the executive vice president of Third Way, a centrist Democratic organization, said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is \u201cvastly more influential\u201d than most freshman House members. But, he added: \u201cLegislating is an inherently group activity. The question is, if she wants to move this legislation, or any that she\u2019s sponsoring, can she attract co-sponsors and votes? We\u2019ll see if she has the ability to do that as well.\u201d As the Green New Deal looked to Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s signature initiative, \u201cA Just Society\u201d echoes Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society. \u201cWith the Green New Deal, we weren\u2019t just talking about climate change; we\u2019re talking about the systems that got us to climate change,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cWe\u2019re addressing root causes.\u201d \u201cAnd similarly,\u201d she added, \u201cwith our Just Society package, we\u2019re not simply addressing poverty or wages. We\u2019re addressing some of the basic structural reasons that are resulting in those outcomes.\u201d Nearly 40 million people in the United States live in poverty. Even middle-class workers face a shortage of affordable housing and stagnant wages. The problems are worse for both people of color, including immigrants, and people who were formerly incarcerated. The Trump administration\u2019s response has been to tighten access to some federally funded low-income programs. The bills in Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s package seek to change the federal response. She conceded that because Democrats do not control the Senate or the White House, her intention is to lay \u201cdown a vision for when we take back both of those bodies.\u201d The Recognizing Real Poverty Act requires the secretary of health and human services, in collaboration with the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to work with the National Academy of Sciences to change the poverty line, adjusting for family size and geographic differences in the cost of goods and services. The poverty threshold would be raised to account for health insurance costs, work expenses, child care, and consideration of new necessities such as internet access. Poverty has been \u201ca taboo word in our politics for so long,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. Even if they are officially above the poverty line, there are \u201cpeople who are living a quality of life on par\u201d with the impoverished, she added, \u201cbut you wouldn\u2019t see that based on our numbers because we choose not to measure it.\u201d Ms. Enriquez said housing has not been a central topic of the Democratic presidential debates, even though several contenders have released full-fledged affordable housing plans. She said she hopes that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez can help elevate the issue with one of the bills in her package, the Place to Prosper Act, which would provide tenant protections and regulate corporate landlords. That bill would cap rent increases at 3 percent a year and restrict the reasons that landlords could evict tenants. For instance, a tenant could only be evicted if they have not paid rent for two or more consecutive months, have wrecked a property, or if the landlord needs a unit to house an immediate relative. The bill would prohibit discrimination because of the source of a tenant\u2019s income and would provide funding for tenant legal representatives. The act would also mandate that landlords keep rental units in good repair. It would allocate $10 billion for fiscal years 2020 through 2029 for removing toxins. Housing in America \u201cis a crisis,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s not one that we are discussing enough at the level that we need to be discussing it.\u201d Two other bills, The Embrace Act and The Mercy in Re-Entry Act, would outlaw the denial of any federal benefit because of immigration status or a past criminal conviction. The Uplift Our Workers Act would create a \u201cworker-friendliness score\u201d for federal contractors which would consider, for example, whether the contractor offers paid overtime for those who work more than 40 hours per week, or provides predictable scheduling, paid sick leave and paid parental and family leave. None of this will be enacted in the foreseeable future. \u201cNo one questions her ability to raise awareness around an issue,\u201d Mr. Bennett said, \u201cjust because she wields her social media and mainstream media platforms very effectively. But that\u2019s not the same as getting votes on a bill.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged the package\u2019s ambitions. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any shortage of obstacles that we have ahead of us, but I don\u2019t think that we not do things just because they\u2019re hard,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, sometimes the hard things to do are the most worthwhile.\u201d",

      "content": " The advertisement began with a photo of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bursting into flames, followed by a black-and-white image of skulls lined up on the ground. The provocative advertisement, which warned about socialism by invoking the murderous Khmer Rouge movement in Cambodia, was paid for by a Republican political action committee and aired during the Democratic primary debate on Thursday night. The televised commercial came weeks after the shooting in El Paso, where a white nationalist killed 22 people in the deadliest massacre targeting Latinos in modern American history. Since El Paso, many Latinos have said they fear for their safety, worried about future attacks by white supremacists. The group that paid for the ad, New Faces GOP, states on its website that its mission is to \u201chelp elevate the next generation of Republicans\u201d and recruit more diverse candidates. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a New York lawmaker who is one of about 40 Latinos in Congress, has previously spoken about receiving death threats and was one of four first-term congresswoman President Trump told to \u201cgo back where you came from.\u201d Shortly after the advertisement aired, she called it \u201ca love letter to the G.O.P.\u2019s white supremacist case.\u201d By Friday morning, many critics on Twitter were calling for a boycott of ABC. Some defended the network by noting that the ad ran only on certain stations, including those owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns 193 local affiliates across the country. National groups also criticized ABC for running the advertisement, saying it promoted violence and calling it \u201ccompletely irresponsible.\u201d A spokeswoman for ABC declined to comment on Friday. On the debate stage, the Democratic candidates discussed the shooting in somber and urgent terms. Many of the candidates praised Beto O\u2019Rourke, an El Paso native, for his aggressive response to the attack. During the debate, his campaign unveiled a new website labeling Mr. Trump a white supremacist. The advertisement features Elizabeth Heng, a Republican from California\u2019s Central Valley who lost her 2018 challenge to Jim Costa, a Democrat, by 15 percentage points. \u201cThis is the face of socialism,\u201d Ms. Heng says, as a picture of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez burns. \u201cDoes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez know the horror of socialism?\u201d Ms. Heng adds as a photo of skulls in a Khmer Rouge death camp is displayed. \u201cMy father was minutes from death in Cambodia before a forced marriage saved his life,\u201d Ms. Heng says. \u201cThat\u2019s socialism: Forced obedience. Starvation.\u201d \u201cMine is a face of freedom \u2014 my skin is not white; I\u2019m not outrageous, racist, nor socialist,\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican.\u201d Republicans have made a significant effort to recruit young candidates of color in recent years, and have stepped up such attempts in California since their 2018 losses. During the midterm elections, Republicans targeted some Democrats with ties to the Middle East by portraying them as terrorist sympathizers. Ms. Heng appeared to take full credit for the advertisement Thursday night. \u201cAre you really calling me a racist,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m calling all Democrats out for supporting an evil ideology.\u201d",

      "author": "Vanessa Friedman",
      "content": " Hair has once again caused a political tempest in a blow dryer. This week, the Washington Times published a story saying that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had spent $80 on a haircut and $180 on color at a Washington, D.C. salon, a styling choice the newspaper presented as hypocritical, given she \u201cregularly rails against the rich and complains about the cost of living inside the Beltway.\u201d Almost immediately, charges of sexism and superficiality began to fly online (also, a debate about the average price of a woman\u2019s haircut, and how little men seem to understand the cost of certain aspects of life). Ms. Ocasio-Cortez herself tweeted out a statement, saying that Vice President Mike Pence \u201cused *taxpayer funds* \u2014 not personal ones \u2014 to spend several thousand haircuts\u2019 worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses.\u201d It would be easy to dismiss this as mere distraction, except it is also the latest in a long line of hair-related controversies in the corridors of power that have surrounded both men and women. Hair is, it seems, a particularly \u2014 well, tangled, subject. Not to mention an equal-opportunity target. Hillary Clinton acknowledged it in 2014, when she joked that the subtitle of her memoir, \u201cHard Choices,\u201d should be \u201cThe Scrunchie Chronicles: 112 Countries and It\u2019s Still All About My Hair.\u201d Though Mrs. Clinton is probably the most famous hair lightning rod, whether it was her chopping and changing while in the White House as first lady (seen as reflecting the opportunism of her husband\u2019s policies), her I-don\u2019t-care-I\u2019m-getting-down-to-work scrunchies as secretary of state, her John Barrett styling trip while on the campaign trail (average price per cut: $600) or her postelection lank and limp blues, she is far from the only politician scrutinized. Her husband was also mocked as far back as 1993 for having a plane wait on the tarmac in Los Angeles while he received a trim from Cristophe of Beverly Hills. The New York Times reported: \u201cQuestions about Mr. Clinton\u2019s runway razor cut dominated the White House news briefing today, with the communications director, George Stephanopoulos, scrambling to explain why the populist President tied up one of the country\u2019s busiest airports to have his hair trimmed.\u201d John Edwards, of course, became something of a poster boy for follicular faux pas during the 2007 presidential campaign when it was revealed he had indulged in two haircuts totaling approximately $800 at a time when he was attempting to sell himself as a champion for working class Americans. It\u2019s not just an American obsession. In 2016, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, then the president of France, came under fire for a reported $10,000 a month styling bill, which was seen as inappropriate for a socialist (it even got its own hashtag: #Coiffuregate). During the 2015 Canadian election, Justin Trudeau\u2019s hair, which, in its lushness, seemed to represent his youth and privilege, had its own Twitter account \u2014 @TrudeausHair. The Economist referred to him as the \u201chair apparent\u201d (a reference to his father, former Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau). And he wasn\u2019t the only one under a follicular microscope: the hair of all the (all-male) candidates played a fairly public role in that election. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s singular flyaway blondness has inspired RTE, the Irish broadcaster, to write that his hair is \u201ckey\u201d to his \u201cpolitical brand,\u201d \u201csymbolizing the chaotic and gaffe-prone style that charms his supporters and appals his critics.\u201d It\u2019s fair to say hair is not just some stringy stuff on the top of our heads. According to Grant McCracken, an anthropologist and author of \u201cBig Hair,\u201d our hair is \u201cour court of deliberation, the place where we contemplate who and what we are.\u201d It is visible, accessible, gender-freighted. It has associations with sex, punishment, class and power. It is probably not happenstance that the United States has not elected a bald president since Dwight D. Eisenhower left office in 1961. When it comes to politics, to care too much about hair, to spend too much on it, makes one seen as superficial and vain; focused on yourself at the expense (literally sometimes) of taxpayers. Ignore it and you are sloppy and lack attention to detail. Men have traditionally used their ability to get inexpensive barber-trims as bragging rights and something of a badge of honor. In the Washington Times story, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is lauded for the fact he got his cuts at the Senate Hair Care Services in the basement of the Russell Senate Office Building for a mere $20 \u2014 though it is acknowledged that \u201cmen\u2019s haircuts there and everywhere else are cheaper than women\u2019s.\u201d In turn, women have often complained about a double standard in price and scrutiny. This has only become more true in the age of Instagram, and during a White House administration where hair has played an outsize symbolic role, from the glossy, blow-dried locks of pretty much all the women in the Trump orbit (the first lady, Tiffany Trump, Vanessa Trump, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Hope Hicks \u2014 and Ivanka before the bob) to the orange-hued and complicated comb-over worn by the president himself. People joke about it, but no one forgets it. Fact is, we\u2019re talking about hair more than ever these days, not less. All of which suggests that, whether we like it or not, when it comes to politics (as when it comes to a lot of life), a trim is rarely just a trim. It\u2019s a weapon, and a tool. If we don\u2019t admit that and wield it ourselves \u2014 with humor, ideally \u2014 then someone else will.",
