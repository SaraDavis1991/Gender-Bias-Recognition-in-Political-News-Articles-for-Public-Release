      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said Friday that the United States had reached an interim deal with China that would forestall a tariff increase slated for next week, providing a temporary d\u00e9tente in a prolonged and economically painful trade war. Mr. Trump, speaking from the Oval Office, said negotiators had reached a \u201cPhase 1\u201d agreement that would take several weeks to write and that both sides could officially sign by November. If completed, the agreement would provide relief to American farmers and businesses that have been battered by the trade war. Mr. Trump said the \u201csubstantial\u201d agreement would involve China buying $40 billion to $50 billion worth of American agricultural products annually, along with guidelines on how it manages its currency, the renminbi. It would also strengthen Chinese protections for American intellectual property and give financial services companies more access to China\u2019s market, the president said. In exchange, the United States will not move ahead next week with plans to raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30 percent. The president has not made a final decision on whether to impose an additional round of tariffs on Dec. 15, as he has threatened. The announcement is a sharp turn from Mr. Trump\u2019s posture several weeks ago, when the president \u2014 angry over China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs \u2014 demanded that American companies stop doing business with China and threatened to tax every toy, shoe and computer from Beijing before the year\u2019s end. The escalation has rattled investors, lawmakers and businesses, which have begun delaying investment and hiring amid continuing uncertainty about the trade war\u2019s trajectory. The economic pain appears to have softened Mr. Trump\u2019s appetite for a fight. On Friday, the president said the two sides would now work on a deal in phases, a reversal from his previous position that he was looking for a \u201ccomplete\u201d China deal, not an interim agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s such a big deal that doing it in sections, in phases, is really better,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a White House meeting with Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier. \u201cSo you\u2019ll either have two phases or three phases.\u201d The first phase could be signed when Mr. Trump appears alongside Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, at a meeting of global leaders in Santiago, Chile, in November. The next phase would begin soon after, Mr. Trump said. Despite the announcement, the deal has not been completed, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that more work remained, including on the agreements related to currency and access for American financial companies. \u201cWe have a fundamental agreement on the key issues,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is a significant amount of work to do.\u201d The deal is far from the type of comprehensive agreement Mr. Trump has been pushing for, and it leaves some of the administration\u2019s biggest concerns about China\u2019s economic practices unresolved. Although exact terms are still under discussion, the details the president announced include some of the concessions that China has previously floated, including purchases of agricultural products and limits on Beijing devaluing its currency to gain a competitive advantage. Still, the agreement, which came during the 13th round of negotiations, will help to defuse trade tensions that have begun inflicting pain on the global economy and bolster business across the Pacific. In his quest to force China to acquiesce to America\u2019s terms, Mr. Trump has already taxed $360 billion worth of Chinese products and had penciled in another round of tariffs on Dec. 15. Stock and commodity prices climbed on Friday as investors anticipated a resolution to the trade spat. The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 1.3 percent. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks, typically viewed as closely tied to the health of the American domestic economy, rose 1.8 percent. Crude oil prices rose, as did prices for key industrial metals such as copper and iron ore, often looked to as a barometer of the outlook for China\u2019s large industrial economy. Stocks of companies with heavy exposure to China soared. Shares of Deere & Company rose 1.9 percent, while Apple gained 2.7 percent and Wynn Resorts, which generates the bulk of its revenue from casinos in China, surged 6.3 percent. An index of semiconductor companies, which depend on Asian supply chains, gained 2.3 percent. Business groups expressed relief that the negotiations between the United States and China appeared to be making progress after more than a year of sputtering, yet they acknowledged that the agreement fell short of the sweeping deal that Mr. Trump had promised. John Neuffer, the president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said the deal was \u201cwelcome news\u201d for his industry that would give \u201cboth sides a chance to get back to the negotiating table to strike a more comprehensive deal.\u201d The initial reaction among Republican lawmakers was cautiously optimistic. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Finance Committee, said that any progress was good news, but that Mr. Trump must reach a more substantial deal for the pain of the trade war to have been worthwhile. \u201cAfter so much has been sacrificed, Americans will settle for nothing less than a full, enforceable and fair deal with China,\u201d Mr. Grassley said. \u201cI look forward to learning more details in the coming days.\u201d Trade experts in China were quick to welcome the deal as a breakthrough. \u201cIt the first time since the start of the trade war that negotiators have reached some solid result,\u201d said Cui Fan, a prominent professor of trade policy at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders say China\u2019s concessions will generate positive momentum for future talks and result in more business for farmers and manufacturers as they continue to press Beijing for a broader pact to correct longstanding economic abuses. Critics say that the move will go only part way toward resolving a crisis of the president\u2019s own making, and that the trade war will continue to slow the global economy. \u201cBehind the hype, this is nothing more than a partial and ostensibly unsustainable deal lacking in real enforcement mechanism,\u201d said Gregory Daco, the chief United States economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cFor businesses, this will mean less damage, not greater certainty.\u201d The interim agreement also does not resolve some of the thorniest issues between the two countries, including whether the United States will continue to label China a currency manipulator and whether it will keep Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, on a government blacklist. In August, the Treasury Department formally designated China a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994, at the direction of Mr. Trump. The largely symbolic move came amid frustration among American officials that China was counteracting the president\u2019s tariffs by devaluing the renminbi. Mr. Mnuchin said that the United States would decide whether to rescind the designation in a future phase of negotiations. And Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, said the deal did not resolve the fate of Huawei, which is banned from buying American products \u2014 much to China\u2019s dismay. \u201cIn this agreement we\u2019re not dealing specifically with Huawei,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not part of this agreement. That\u2019s a separate process.\u201d Mr. Trump and his advisers also did not mention any progress in areas that the American business community has identified as critical to its ability to compete with Chinese companies \u2014 including China\u2019s subsidization of industries, the role of the government in the economy and the country\u2019s restrictions on transfers of data across its borders. \u201cOur hope and our aspiration is that they get to those harder issues,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Still, he added that the steps taken this week might create positive momentum toward addressing those issues. \u201cWe\u2019ve had nothing but bad news since May in the U.S.-China relationship,\u201d Mr. Brilliant said. \u201cAnd now we seemed to have put a halt to a further escalation of tensions, and that\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said that the deal would require China to make structural changes to how it screened food imports and approved new genetically modified products that would allow more American farm goods to flow there. \u201cIt will be much easier now for American farmers to be able to ship to China,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve made some changes on our side too that will help the Chinese.\u201d The agreement came after Chinese officials shifted their position on the trade talks over the past month, moving from an insistence on a complete removal of American tariffs to a willingness to accept a partial deal that would leave many of those tariffs in place. One important factor in China\u2019s shifting stance involved a severe yet unexpected problem: a genuine need for food imports from the United States. African swine fever has killed an estimated two fifths of China\u2019s pig herd over the past year, producing a sharp increase in pork prices. The need for increased food imports from the United States persuaded the Chinese that both sides could benefit from a partial deal even if it did not involve complete elimination of Mr. Trump\u2019s new tariffs, a person familiar with the talks said. Mr. Trump acknowledged that tensions with China had spiraled as a result of the trade war but said that relations between the two countries were now \u201ca love fest.\u201d \u201cTalk was getting tough,\u201d the president said, adding that both sides had \u201cplanes\u201d and \u201cships\u201d and that \u201cstupid things can happen.\u201d",

      "content": " One called President Trump\u2019s decision \u201can egregious act of betrayal.\u201d Another said the policy could be \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d A third said Mr. Trump \u201cis in danger of losing the mandate of heaven.\u201d Conservative Christians have ardently stood by Mr. Trump at most every turn, from allegations of sexual misconduct to his policy of separating migrant families at the border and the Russia investigation. But this week, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s top evangelical supporters broke rank to raise alarms over his move to withdraw troops from Syria, which prompted Turkish forces to launch a ground and air assault against a Kurdish-led militia that has been a crucial ally in the American fight against ISIS. As Turkish warplanes began to bomb Syrian towns on Wednesday, the prominent evangelist Franklin Graham called for Mr. Trump to reconsider his decision, and worried that the Kurds \u2014 and the Christian minorities in the region they have defended \u2014 could be annihilated. \u201cWe have many friends in the Kurdish areas,\u201d said Mr. Graham, whose humanitarian organization, Samaritan\u2019s Purse, has done relief work in the region. \u201cWe know people on the ground.\u201d The concern resonated for many conservative evangelicals who have supported Mr. Trump, and called into question his much-touted commitment to religious freedom, a top value for his base. The opposition has arrived at an inopportune time for the president. The administration is weathering a heated battle with Congress, and according to a Fox News poll, more than half of voters now support the president\u2019s impeachment. Tony Perkins, who leads the Family Research Council, is calling on the administration to actively demonstrate its support for persecuted religious minorities in the aftermath of the withdrawal. \u201cThis is inconsistent with what the president has done,\u201d he said. Erick Erickson, a well-known conservative evangelical blogger, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump had committed \u201can egregious act of betrayal\u201d to the Kurds. \u201cShame on him,\u201d he said. Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, said he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the president\u2019s decision, and added that \u201cthe president of the United States is in great danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen.\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, who rarely breaks with the president, said it could be \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d Current disappointment is unlikely to translate into substantial or lasting opposition. And not all evangelical supporters have taken issue with Mr. Trump\u2019s decision. Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Dallas and a prominent supporter of Mr. Trump, said he \u201chappily\u201d deferred to the commander in chief, and he praised Mr. Trump for carrying through on a campaign promise to end American involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts. \u201cSome evangelicals may disagree with the president\u2019s decision,\u201d Mr. Jeffress said, \u201cbut I guarantee you there is not one evangelical supporter of the president who would switch their vote and support Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden over a Syria decision.\u201d Franklin Graham stopped short of condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s policy outright. The evangelist said he communicated with the president or vice president \u2014 he would not specify which leader \u2014 about the troop withdrawal within the last 48 hours, and said he ultimately deferred to their determinations. He declined to give specifics of his conversation. \u201cThere are so many other issues at stake here,\u201d he said, listing things such as Turkey\u2019s membership in NATO and U.S. military bases in the country. \u201cIt is a very hard decision.\u201d Mr. Perkins pointed to the administration\u2019s other efforts for religious freedom, and said that \u201cone incident doesn\u2019t make an administration.\u201d Religious freedom, like anti-abortion policy and conservative judges, has often been a point of pride for many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters. At the United Nations last month, Mr. Trump earned praise from supporters for highlighting religious freedom instead of prioritizing a major climate summit. As Mr. Trump\u2019s call with the president of Ukraine roiled Washington last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, an evangelical who often weaves together Christianity and foreign policy, spoke on religious freedom in Rome. This summer, around the time of the Mueller hearings on Capitol Hill, the State Department convened a celebrated gathering to advance global religious freedom. Conservative Christians can point to the administration\u2019s priority of defending religious freedom, but action and policy are more revealing than words, said Meighan Stone, an evangelical Christian and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIf this administration can\u2019t be good allies to the Kurds in this battle, where is this policy that is supposed to be protecting persecuted religious minorities around the world?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt is nonexistent.\u201d When asked about human rights abuses of non-Christian communities, or in regions that are not as tied to biblical history \u2014 for example, how China has targeted Uighurs and other largely Muslim minorities in the autonomous region of Xinjiang \u2014 Mr. Graham demurred. \u201cI am not familiar with these people,\u201d Mr. Graham said of the Uighurs, noting that he had not visited the region. \u201cI\u2019d certainly condemn China for, it\u2019s not just the Uighurs, they\u2019ve been destroying churches.\u201d Churches across Christian traditions \u2014 Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant \u2014 often share spiritual and personal ties to congregations in the Middle East, praying for their pastors or families by name, or inviting them to speak when they visit the United States. Many church leaders galvanized support in 2014 when ISIS fighters targeted, killed and raped fleeing religious minorities, including Christians and Yazidis. Now, that fear is remerging and motivating evangelical alarm, explained Jeremy Courtney, who leads a relief effort called Preemptive Love that works in northeastern Syria and in the Al Hol tent camp, which has been described as a growing hotbed of ISIS fighters and their families. \u201cAnother way to view it is Christian self-interest, that if ISIS reconstitutes, then there will be another ISIS genocide against Christians, and maybe Arabs get killed, maybe Yazidis will get killed, but the subtle undercurrent is that maybe Christians will get killed,\u201d said Mr. Courtney, who was raised as an evangelical in Texas and has lived north of Baghdad for almost 13 years. \u201cThat is a legitimate concern, it is just disturbing to me,\u201d he said. \u201cChristians speaking out on this should be concerned about the Muslims who will lose their lives because of this policy as well.\u201d The troop withdrawal in Syria is likely to be a topic of conversation this weekend at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, where President Trump is scheduled to speak to hundreds of conservative leaders. At the event, the evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson, whom Turkey accused of spying and detained for two years, will receive an award marking the one-year anniversary of his release. For many conservative Christians, Mr. Brunson has become a symbol of the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to protecting persecuted Christians in unfriendly regions. This week, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that America\u2019s relationship with Turkey \u201chas been very good.\u201d In a phone call on Thursday evening, Mr. Brunson said the decision to withdraw troops from Syria and the ensuing Turkish attack have left him \u201cdistressed.\u201d He spoke of the refugees he met working in the Syrian-Turkish border region, including friends who had converted to Christianity and who were currently in Kobani, a Syrian town now under Turkish assault. \u201cI don\u2019t think Turkey is a friend of the West anymore,\u201d Mr. Brunson said. \u201cThis is a point of great concern to me, obviously.\u201d",

      "content": " Ms. Yovanovitch delivered her searing account before Congress at the risk of losing her job, since the White House has ordered officials not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. This afternoon I stopped by the desk of Sharon LaFraniere, who has written about Ms. Yovanovitch, to discuss why the former ambassador to Ukraine was so intent on speaking out. Sharon, how unusual was her participation? And how unusual was her testimony? She testified despite a White House declaration that there would be no more cooperation with Congress. She\u2019s acting in defiance of the White House. Her testimony today was a really damning indictment of how the Trump administration is conducting foreign policy. She warned against people who in search of personal gain or private influence undermined the work of American government officials and threatened the policy goals of the United States. And on top of all that, she said the State Department is being hollowed out from within, because diplomats don\u2019t feel the government has their back. What does she know that House Democrats want to know? She seemed to suggest that businesspeople who are allies of Rudy Giuliani may have orchestrated this campaign to get her out for their own private gain. Was she removed because she was standing in the way of some sort of quid pro quo deal that the White House was planning to execute? Did they see her as unwilling to play ball in what might have been a corrupt game? Those are the questions impeachment investigators want to answer. \u201cSmart, charismatic, ruthless, a little megalomaniacal.\u201d \u201cAmbitious, righteous, then self-righteous.\u201d \u201cPersonable ... for a little while.\u201d \u201cDecisive, combative, conspiratorial.\u201d \u201cPugilistic, erratic, extremely smart, reckless.\u201d \u201cForceful, combative, energetic, vindictive, tireless, annoying.\u201d That\u2019s Rudy Giuliani, as described by our reporters who have covered him over the past 35 years. A forthcoming episode of The Weekly traces his path from crime-busting prosecutor to Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, now at the center of the impeachment inquiry. The episode focuses in part on a brutal zinger \u2014 that Mr. Giuliani needed only \u201ca noun and a verb and 9/11\u201d to construct a sentence \u2014 that was delivered by none other than Joe Biden, which helped sink the former New York City mayor\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cGiuliani did not like that line. I don\u2019t think he ever forgot that Biden said it,\u201d my colleague Maggie Haberman says on the show. To better understand how we got to this point, I called Dan Barry, who appears in The Weekly episode and has chronicled Mr. Giuliani for decades. What do you see in Rudy today that reminds you of the guy you\u2019ve covered for so many years? There\u2019s this combativeness, that need to be at the center of attention \u2014 the willingness to go almost anywhere to champion whatever the cause of the moment is for him. All those character traits on display now are quite familiar to anyone who followed him closely 20 or 30 years ago. But the Rudy we see now is also at odds with the Rudy of the \u201980s and \u201990s, with his moral rectitude then. He was Mr. Law and Order. Why, after so many years in the public eye, did he want to work for Mr. Trump? He was leading in the polls in the 2007 to be the Republican nominee for president. He was spending oodles of money. He was getting a lot of ink. And then it all evaporated. He spent millions and ended up with one delegate. That stung. He was an international hero, and then was roundly rejected. He always wanted to be relevant. He needed to be relevant. What happened in 2016? He becomes relevant. Now, he\u2019s effectively the shadow secretary of state. I think he revels in that.

      "content": " Donald Trump is probably the weakest he\u2019s been since becoming president. He all but confessed to trying to tilt the next election in his favor with pleas \u2014 public and private \u2014 to China and Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president, and Biden\u2019s son. A majority of Americans support the Democratic impeachment inquiry; a plurality wants him impeached already. His defense is anything but, as allies like Rudy Giuliani keep undermining his position with their own misconduct. His approval rating is on the wane, and he trails his Democratic opponents in key swing states like Wisconsin. And yet most congressional Republicans refuse to break with the president. Despite his obvious wrongdoing and complete unfitness for the job, the vast majority of Republican office holders in Washington are \u201cride or die\u201d supporters of Trump. [Jamelle Bouie answered your questions about this column on Twitter.] The most common explanation for this stalwart commitment is simply fear. \u201cAcross the country,\u201d reports The Washington Post, \u201cmost G.O.P. lawmakers have responded to questions about Trump\u2019s conduct with varying degrees of silence, shrugged shoulders or pained defenses. For now, their collective strategy is simply to survive and not make any sudden moves.\u201d The former Arizona senator Jeff Flake made a version of this point last month, when he said that most Senate Republicans \u2014 \u201cat least 35\u201d \u2014 would vote to remove Trump if it were on a secret ballot. [Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing, culture and ideas from around the internet. For exclusive thoughts, photos and reading recommendations, sign up for his newsletter.] The reason for the fear, in this telling, is the Republican base and its total commitment to the president. This overwhelming support is a threat to almost any lawmaker who breaks ranks. Challenge Trump and you may end up in a primary against a more MAGA-compliant opponent. I think there\u2019s another explanation \u2014 one that accounts for Republican behavior without casting these lawmakers as would-be dissidents. On most issues, congressional Republicans don\u2019t actually disagree with or disapprove of the president. They might find him coarse and occasionally abhorrent \u2014 when he was still the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan took a shot at Trump after his \u201cboth sides\u201d remarks regarding the white supremacist march and violence in Charlottesville, Va. \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they have a problem with his administration. And why would they? Despite his somewhat heterodox campaign, Trump has been a remarkably conservative president. For most Republican lawmakers, to oppose Trump would be to oppose their own interests. Most Republican lawmakers were sent to Washington to fight for spending cuts, lower taxes and conservative judges. Why would any of them stand against a president who has delivered on each count? Trump has taken an ax to domestic spending programs for the poor \u2014 his Agriculture Department just proposed new cuts to food stamps; he signed a tax cut that funnels trillions to the highest earners; and he stacked the federal judiciary with right-wing ideologues. It\u2019s hard to imagine a better outcome for a conservative politician. When Trump occasionally deviates from conservative orthodoxy \u2014 or otherwise bucks the party\u2019s consensus \u2014 Republican lawmakers try to push him back in line. Earlier this year, Senate Republicans didn\u2019t hesitate to challenge the administration on its plan to impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico. \u201cI will yield to nobody in passion and seriousness and commitment for securing the border,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said to reporters at the time. \u201cBut there\u2019s no reason for Texas farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and small businesses to pay the price of massive new taxes.\u201d Likewise, Senate Republicans took a collective stand against Trump after the White House announced his plan this week to withdraw American forces from northern Syria, clearing the path for Turkish military operations against Kurds in the region. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, warned Trump against a \u201cprecipitous withdrawal\u201d; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called the move \u201ca big win for Iran and Assad, a big win for ISIS\u201d; Ben Sasse of Nebraska said the president \u201cneeds to know that this bad decision will likely result in the slaughter of allies who fought with us, including women and children.\u201d It\u2019s true that the Republican base isn\u2019t invested in American foreign policy toward Syria. It\u2019s also true, however, that Trump may well lash out against his Republican critics, which could turn his voters against them on this particular issue. But Senate Republicans spoke right up. This time around, the fear that\u2019s supposed to drive their acquiescence to Trump doesn\u2019t exist. If Republicans are willing to challenge Trump on his foreign policy, including the disposition of American troops abroad, then the difference when it comes to Ukraine \u2014 as well as other scandals, like the president\u2019s continued corruption and self-dealing \u2014 may just be that they don\u2019t see a problem. You can read Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s willingness to downplay Trump\u2019s open call to intervene in the 2020 election as a craven surrender, or you can take it at face value: Maybe Rubio just doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal. None of this would be out of character for congressional Republicans. These are the lawmakers who refused to fix the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court killed a key provision of the law in 2013. They said nothing when Trump tried to launch a crusade against imaginary \u201cvoter fraud.\u201d They are at best indifferent to the restrictive laws and voter purges that keep millions of Americans from the polls. Sometimes, the simplest answer is the correct one. Why are most Republicans silent in the face of the president\u2019s attempt to cheat his way to re-election? Perhaps it\u2019s because they don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong \u2014 or because they don\u2019t care if it is.",

      "content": " Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox. Today I\u2019m turning over the top of the newsletter to my colleagues Michael D. Shear, one of our White House correspondents, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis, our congressional editor. Their fantastic new book, which comes out tomorrow, details two years of inside-the-administration reporting on President Trump\u2019s signature issue: his opposition to immigration. (The book has already made news by revealing the president\u2019s desire for an alligator-filled moat along the border and his suggestion that migrants be shot in the legs.) Here\u2019s what they had to say about Mr. Trump\u2019s fixation with immigration and what it all may mean for the 2020 race. Six days before the 2018 midterm elections, President Trump got into a shouting match over the phone with Paul Ryan, who was then the speaker of the House. That argument may reveal quite a bit about what to expect from the president when his 2020 campaign ramps up next year. In 2018, Mr. Ryan was furious at Mr. Trump for talking endlessly about immigration \u2014 the dangers from caravans of migrants, a pledge to end birthright citizenship, his obsession with the border. \u201cRyan was exasperated. Trump still didn\u2019t get it,\u201d we write in the book. \u201cYou are not helping anything by talking about this kind of stuff,\u201d Mr. Ryan told Mr. Trump. After Republicans lost their majority, the speaker blamed the president\u2019s comments about birthright citizenship, adding that his talk of sealing the border and having American troops shoot at migrants had not helped either. Mr. Trump had made the congressional elections about him and his visceral message of fear and loathing toward immigrants, and voters in vital pockets of the country had recoiled, one of Mr. Ryan\u2019s associates later told a colleague: \u201cHe had just hijacked the whole thing.\u201d What does that mean for 2020? At the moment, you could be excused for thinking that the only subject on Mr. Trump\u2019s mind is the impeachment inquiry aimed at removing him from office. But railing against immigration is in the president\u2019s electoral DNA. When Mr. Trump announced his 2016 campaign by calling Mexicans \u201crapists,\u201d his political advisers were ecstatic, according to our reporting: \u201cTrump had been at No. 8 in some polls when he was at the top of the escalator before his announcement. Within weeks, he had shot up to the top of the Republican pack.\u201d Stephen Miller, the architect of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration agenda, told us that voters would \u201cresoundingly side with the political party that secured the border. And not by a little bit. Not by 55-45, 60-40, 70-30, 80-20. I\u2019m talking 90-10 on that.\u201d Is that right? According to our reporting, one of the Republican Party\u2019s leading pollsters concluded after the midterms that \u201cimmigration and the caravan had overwhelmed the economic message that Ryan and other Republicans had been trying to highlight by a two-to-one margin.\u201d That\u2019s the danger for Mr. Trump. His obsession with immigration could once again overshadow the party\u2019s tax cuts, a 3.5 percent unemployment rate and growth in wages. Even so, expect dire warnings about \u201copen border Democrats,\u201d furious demands to stop asylum seekers and a relentless focus on his \u201cbig beautiful wall.\u201d The president believes that immigration is what brought him to the White House, and he\u2019s not about to abandon it now.

Another colleague, Shane Goldmacher, spent his weekend standing in the street and sitting in a hotel lobby in Philadelphia, as Joe Biden\u2019s biggest donors and fund-raisers met for their first big retreat since the campaign began. He sends this dispatch: The gathering of Mr. Biden\u2019s most important financiers came at an awkward time. Just a few hours before they toured his Philadelphia headquarters, Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign announced that she had out-raised Mr. Biden by nearly $10 million in the last three months. She was the subject of most of the weekend\u2019s conversation, both among Biden officials and the donors, even though Senator Bernie Sanders had actually raised a little more than her. Some donors were downbeat. But mostly there was a palpable sense of determination. These retreats serve two purposes: 1. Thank the donors for the millions they\u2019ve already raised. 2. Exhort them to raise even more. There were drinks on Friday and a day filled with PowerPoints on Saturday. Most of Mr. Biden\u2019s top brass appeared: the campaign manager Greg Schultz, deputy campaign managers Kate Bedingfield and Pete Kavanaugh, senior advisers Crist\u00f3bal Alex and Symone Sanders, and Becca Siegel, the chief analytics officer. Oh, and Mr. Biden came too. Several donors said the weekend presentations were thoughtful, well prepared and steady, if not flashy or particularly inspiring. In that way, two attendees separately likened it to Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy itself. O.K., so who had Jeff Daniels in the actor-playing-James-Comey betting pool? Were you forwarded this newsletter?

      "content": " When the Democratic leadership was finally forced to formally back an impeachment inquiry, they faced a choice: focus broadly on all of Donald Trump\u2019s corruption and unfitness, which could drag on for a long time, or focus narrowly on the new revelations about Trump and Ukraine and do so quickly. They chose the latter. I happen to agree with that strategy, if one assumes that you only have one shot at this. But, I also propose another scenario: Do both. Draw up articles of impeachment on the narrow case of Ukraine, but don\u2019t close the impeachment inquiry. Keep it open and ready to draw up more articles as new corruption is uncovered. Impeach Trump repeatedly if necessary. There is nothing in the Constitution that prevents a president from being impeached more than once. Trump and his administration are stonewalling in every way possible, refusing to produce administration officials for testimony and refusing to produce documents. In many cases, Democrats in the House have taken the administration to court over its stonewalling, but court cases take time. It could be months, if not years, before there is a judgment in those cases. But, as we are learning with the Ukraine case, Trump\u2019s contempt for law, propriety and process is boundless. He clearly abused the power of his office when attempting to pressure that country into investigating Joe and Hunter Biden. And, we only know this because a whistle-blower stepped forward and said something. Now, The New York Times is reporting that a second whistle-blower in the Ukraine saga is considering filing a complaint. Mark Zaid, attorney for the first whistle-blower, said Sunday that he was now representing a second whistle-blower, but that he didn\u2019t know if it was the same person identified in The Times\u2019s report. Could there be three? Whistle-blowers can draw courage from one another. There can be a positive copycat effect that snowballs. The impeachment inquiry needs to remain open after the Ukraine affair, not only to allow the cases in the courts to be resolved, but also to allow future whistle-blowers\u2019 information to be immediately considered in the context of impeachment. Barring a massive shift in public opinion, efforts to convict and remove Trump are destined to fail in the Republican-controlled Senate. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week on CNBC that the Senate would have no choice but to have a trial if the House passes articles of impeachment. McConnell put it this way: \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a Senate rule related to impeachment that would take 67 votes to change. So, I would have no choice but to take it up. How long you\u2019re on it is a whole different matter, but I would have no choice but to take it up.\u201d This suggests that McConnell could \u201ctake up\u201d a House impeachment but quickly move to dismiss it, thereby allowing the Republican Senate to cowardly back out of doing its duty to place patriotism over party. I say, in that case, deluge them with new articles of impeachment as they present themselves. Force the Senate to continually hold trials and take votes defending Trump\u2019s wrongdoing all the way up to the eve of the election. Some people worry that a single impeachment may strengthen Trump\u2019s hand in 2020. They will no doubt be apoplectic about the idea of doing it multiple times, deeper into the campaign season. But I say, Trump \u2014 and his propaganda machine at Fox News \u2014 are going to spin every scenario to their best ability. Trump is not going down without a fight, even at the ballot box. I believe that Democrats have to place their faith in something more fundamental: the power of the truth. There are politics involved in everything that happens in Washington. And impeachment is no different. In fact, it is a purely political act. But beyond that, there is an apolitical truth: All political corruption, abuses of power, conspiracies, cover-ups and attempts to deceive and mislead the public are wrong. Many Trump loyalists will never accede to this point, but many more Americans, at the core, know this difference between right and wrong. Trump deserves to be impeached for every offense he has committed against the office of the presidency and the American people. That means that the impeachment inquiry can\u2019t be constrained by electoral calendars or judicial machinations. Precedent must be considered here. What precedent would it set if a president could simply stonewall and run out the clock in court, preventing Congress from performing its oversight and dodging any and all attempts to hold him or her accountable? What precedent would it set if a president abused his power and broke the law but learned that he need only rile up his or her base to keep Congress at bay? All of this would set a terrible precedent. Trump must be held accountable, fully and completely. The Ukraine development unexpectedly entered the conversation as a clear, neat package of wrongdoing that was easy for Americans to understand. But that doesn\u2019t wipe away the many other wrongdoings \u2014 obstruction of justice for instance \u2014 that also must be addressed for history\u2019s sake. I say, impeach Trump as often as necessary until all the corruption has been laid bare.",

On a Twitter account set up to celebrate the life of the singer, the estate said that Jones Day, the law firm that has represented Mr. Trump in election law matters and continuing lawsuits, had agreed last October that the campaign would not use Prince\u2019s songs at rallies and other events. The estate posted a letter it said it had received from Jones Day last year. \u201cWithout admitting liability, and to avoid any future dispute, we write to confirm that the Campaign will not use Prince\u2019s music in connection with its activities going forward,\u201d the letter said. The estate said on Twitter that despite that understanding, \u201cPurple Rain\u201d had been played at the Minneapolis rally. \u201cThe Prince Estate will never give permission to President Trump to use Prince\u2019s songs,\u201d it said. A representative for Jones Day was not immediately available for comment on Friday. Other artists have asked the Trump campaign not to use their music, including Rihanna and Axl Rose, and the wording in the Jones Day letter resembled one also sent to representatives of Steven Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith, who had objected to the playing of his music at Trump events. Such requests are not unusual for politicians and the arenas where they drum up support. Usually, music rights agencies advise campaigns to buy blanket licenses so they can play music in the agencies\u2019 catalogs wherever they are. Arenas where politicians appear often have a blanket license that allows the venue to play any song in an agency\u2019s catalog. Sometimes artists find that their music has slipped through into an event for a politician they do not support. In 2018, Pharrell Williams sent a letter to the president after the song \u201cHappy\u201d was played at an event on the day of the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh. But the group that hosted the event, the National FFA (Future Farmers of America) Organization, said its organist had played the song without any input from the campaign, The New York Times reported.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state of Minnesota since Richard M. Nixon\u2019s victory there in 1972. But President Trump has long viewed it as the one that got away. Mr. Trump barely set foot in the state during his 2016 campaign, and his field organization on the ground was nonexistent: The lone Trump campaign staff member working the state was moved to Colorado before Election Day. But Mr. Trump lost Minnesota to his former rival Hillary Clinton by 1.5 percentage points, or less than 45,000 votes. \u201cWe almost won it,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a visit this year to a trucking company in a Minneapolis suburb. The difference between a victory and a loss, he said, would have been coming to the state to give \u201cone more speech.\u201d This time, the Trump campaign is determined not to let Minnesota go without trying. So on Thursday night, Mr. Trump will arrive in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic congressional districts in the country, for his first political rally since House Democrats began an impeachment investigation that threatens to engulf his presidency. It is a rare rally for Mr. Trump in a state he did not win in 2016, and takes him to the heart of opposition territory: In 2018, the city helped elect to the House Ilhan Omar, a Democratic woman of color who has become one of the president\u2019s favorite foils. Mr. Trump\u2019s rally at Target Center will be bolstered by a \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d event hosted by the second lady, Karen Pence, and Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, on Wednesday in St. Paul. Vice President Mike Pence will hold his own round table on Thursday in nearby Lakeville. Meanwhile, Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s campaign manager, is planning to pour tens of millions of dollars into the campaign\u2019s Minnesota operation, compared with the $30,000 the Trump campaign spent on the state last cycle. The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100. And the campaign and the Republican National Committee are outspending Democrats by about four to one on digital advertising, according to campaign officials and local Democratic Party officials. \u201cIt is a full-on major effort state campaign,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. \u201cAnd we will have the resources behind it to make it count.\u201d Minnesota Democrats said it felt as if their state was a true battleground for the first time in decades. \u201cOver the last 25 years, I\u2019ve never seen an investment as robust and deep this early by a Republican presidential candidate,\u201d said Ken Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. Mr. Martin said it was clear to him that \u201cTrump and the Republicans believe they can win and are doing everything to make it so.\u201d Few states in the Midwest exemplify Mr. Trump\u2019s strengths, such as popularity in rural areas, as well as his weaknesses, such as his shaky standing in suburban areas, the way Minnesota does. Which group turns out in bigger numbers could determine who wins the state on Election Day. If Mr. Trump succeeds in flipping Minnesota\u2019s 10 electoral votes, it will probably mean that he has secured himself another four years in the White House. No Democratic candidate can carve a path to victory without Minnesota, and Trump officials are eager to put Democrats on defense there. One campaign official compared the dynamic to Republicans having to spend resources to defend a Republican stronghold like Indiana. But the changing makeup of the state has made Minnesota something of a microcosm for the Trump campaign\u2019s challenge as it builds him a solid infrastructure nationwide: This time isn\u2019t last time. \u201cThis election is much more a referendum on him and his performance as president,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. \u201cHe has managed to turn a lot of voters off through his conduct and performance. It\u2019s hard to overcome that with field organizing.\u201d Mr. Garin noted that the suburban vote in Minnesota was much more significant than in neighboring Wisconsin, and Mr. Trump was consistently polling poorly in suburbs. \u201cA variety of factors have taken it from being a closely contested state to much more of a slingshot for Trump,\u201d Mr. Garin said. \u201cThe kind of antics at his rallies that occur are unlikely to help him in Minnesota.\u201d To win Minnesota, Mr. Trump would have to gain about 45,000 more votes than he did in 2016, while keeping Democratic turnout roughly the same as it was last cycle. A poll commissioned before his visit Thursday by Alliance for a Better Minnesota, a group aligned with Democrats, showed that 49 percent of respondents favored an impeachment inquiry, compared with 44 percent who believed it was a bad idea. The poll, conducted by Public Policy Polling, also found that 52 percent of respondents would vote for an unnamed Democratic opponent if the election were held today, compared with 42 percent who said they would vote for Mr. Trump. \u201cWe had record turnout for a midterm election in 2018,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cThat was fueled in urban cores and suburbs. He\u2019s going to have to do better than he did in the suburbs and exurbs, and we haven\u2019t seen that happening.\u201d For their part, Trump campaign officials are more focused on the Iron Range, the mining communities in the northern part of the state. In 2016, for instance, Mr. Trump won the states\u2019 Eighth District in the north by 16 points. President Barack Obama won it by six points in 2012. That is where Trump campaign officials see an urban-rural divide that is trending in their direction, while the election of progressive lawmakers like Ms. Omar has pushed voters further in the direction of Democrats in urban areas. Iron Rangers in northern Minnesota have been fleeing the Democratic Party because of promises to end the fossil fuel industry, among others, according to local officials, who point to Representative Collin C. Peterson, a Democrat, as an example of the state\u2019s changing politics. Mr. Peterson, who represents Minnesota\u2019s Seventh District, won his race in 2012 by 26 points. In 2018, he eked out a victory with a much slimmer 4-point margin. In 2016, Mr. Trump won the Seventh District by 31.5 points. But the rural regions in the state have also seen a loss of population, while the suburbs, where Mr. Trump has done little to expand his appeal with voters, have grown. This week, Mr. Trump tried to capitalize on that divide by leaning into a fight with Jacob Frey, the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis, who wanted to charge the campaign about half-a-million dollars for the extra security required to host the presidential visit. Framing Mr. Trump as a victim, his campaign accused the mayor of trying to shut down the rally. In a statement, the campaign called Mr. Frey a \u201cradical leftist mayor\u201d who was \u201cabusing the power of his office and attempting to extort President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign by conjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security in an effort to block a scheduled Keep America Great rally.\u201d The campaign ultimately settled the dispute without paying the additional funds. It was not clear whether the city or the arena would be footing the bill instead. But some Democrats said they worried Mr. Frey had inflamed a real divide in the state, emboldening people to go see Mr. Trump after a Democratic mayor appeared to try to tell them they could not. The heated back-and-forth hinted at the aggrieved tone Mr. Trump plans to strike at the rally Thursday night. \u201cThe lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday on Twitter.",

      "content": " Katie Benner, who covers the Justice Department for us, said federal prosecutors probably had the indictment ready to go for a while and were keeping tabs on Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. When the two got one-way tickets out of the country, she said, the prosecutors realized that they had to move. My colleague Mike Schmidt got an eyewitness account of the arrests in the Lufthansa lounge in the B concourse of Dulles International Airport on Wednesday. Here\u2019s what he heard: At first glance, the two men might seem peripheral to the events that the House is investigating. But they were involved in the Ukraine affair from the beginning, dating to Mr. Parnas\u2019s job as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s fixer in Ukraine. This evening I stopped by the desk of my colleague Ken Vogel, who revealed Mr. Parnas\u2019s involvement in Mr. Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine efforts, to get a sense of why they matter to the impeachment investigation. Why are these two men so important to understanding the whole Ukraine scandal? They were Rudy Giuliani\u2019s enablers and facilitators in his Ukrainian expedition. They connected Mr. Giuliani to the Ukrainian prosecutors who provided both the information and the potential investigations that are at the center of President Trump\u2019s interest in Ukraine. They were at the very front of all of this activity that led to what became the whistle-blower complaint. Why did that activity raise alarm bells? Their ability to get Congressman Sessions to take up their cause on such a niche issue that might not have been on his radar \u2014 helping to oust the American ambassador to Ukraine \u2014 is precisely the type of thing that campaign finance watchdogs warn of when they bemoan the power of money of politics. How valuable can they be to federal prosecutors, who\u2019ve clearly been investigating them long before the impeachment investigation? It depends who the prosecutors are after. The two men could certainly flip and provide plenty of information about Rudy Giuliani. I have a source who saw Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and Mr. Giuliani together not infrequently at the Trump hotel here in Washington. What about to Congress? They were supposed to be important witnesses in the impeachment investigation this week before they were arrested. They could be very useful to Congress, but maybe not as much in the impeachment inquiry. They don\u2019t have a ton of access or visibility into Trump himself, so it could be a bit of a bank shot. But in another way, they could be extremely useful. Congress has shown a great interest in the outsourcing of foreign policy, and these guys are right in the middle of that. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump will hold a campaign rally in Minneapolis, his first since the impeachment investigation began. On Friday, House investigators are due to interview  the career diplomat and former American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, whose ouster was sought by Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and many in the Trump administration. Despite the White House\u2019s attempts to block cooperation by State Department employees, Ms. Yovanovitch has signaled to House staff members that she is willing to speak to them.",

Over the last few years, and particularly since the Robert Mueller investigation concluded, I have grown accustomed to Trump delivering his insults, launching his attacks and spewing his lies with a swaggering smugness. This was not that. What was on display Wednesday was anger animated by panicked fear. And at another news conference with the Finnish president, Trump repeated his stupefying performance, rambling and raving, dodging questions and misdirecting attention. And, of course, lying.

The whistle-blower is now the \u201c#FakeWhistleblower\u201d whom he wants to identify and \u201cinterview.\u201d Anyone who spoke with the whistle-blower is \u201cclose to a spy,\u201d and Trump said: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d He has suggested that Adam Schiff is criminal and even treasonous. He has called the impeachment inquiry a \u201ccoup.\u201d And, he has quoted someone who said that removing him from office \u201cwill cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d This will not end well. There is nothing Trump hates and fears more than being publicly chastised and embarrassed. He has always believed that he could control the narrative even if he couldn\u2019t control the facts. Facts don\u2019t really matter to the man. But the march toward impeachment is beyond his control. He can\u2019t bully his way out of it. He can\u2019t lie his way out of it. It is happening. If he obstructs in any way it could only add to eventual articles of impeachment. The walls are closing in on him; his options to avoid are nearly nil. The presidency has many powers, awesome powers, but Congress also has powers, and impeachment is one of them. Trump is likely to become only the third president to be impeached and the first to be impeached over his dealings with a foreign government, one of the things the framers of the Constitution feared most. This is outrageous to Trump, a man who has patterned his entire presidency as a rebuke to and competition with his predecessor, Barack Obama. Not only will Trump not get a Nobel Peace Prize, he\u2019ll get an American badge of dishonor. A black president of decency will trounce the president of white supremacy. This fact alone is no doubt pushing Trump to the verge of explosion. He will do anything to avoid this. But this may now be all out of his hands. The whistle-blower complaint has been filed and its credibility bolstered by Trump\u2019s own statements, the rough transcript memo released by the White House and confirmations from the White House. There are other things we want and need to know, to be sure, because there may well be other abuses of power about which we are still unaware. But the basis for at least one article of impeachment has already been established: abuse of power. The House could vote on that one any day it wished. In fact, paradoxically, the longer Democrats drag out their investigation to strengthen their case, the more time Trump will have to muddy the waters with lies and conspiracies, possibly weakening that case, with the public at least. We have to remember that Trump isn\u2019t a politician who entered the arena with a deep desire to serve and with appreciation for the country\u2019s history, customs and institutions. Trump ran for president as an exercise of self-flattery and to boost his brand. His win was surprising, even for him. So we should never expect him to be patriotic when he is being condemned. Before Trump will allow himself to be chased from the temple, he\u2019ll bring it down.",

      "content": " Two ways to judge anything Donald Trump does these days: A) Is it a good idea? And B) Is it further evidence he\u2019s going nuts? Think about Turkey. Over the weekend, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was preparing to attack our old Kurdish allies in northern Syria. The White House announced late Sunday night that it was O.K. with the whole deal and was pulling out the small American military contingent that\u2019s been fighting alongside the Kurds. Nobody seemed to have run this by Defense Secretary Mark (Finally Confirmed!) Esper, who sent out a tweet Monday morning opposing the Turkish operation. Which was later deleted. \u201cIf Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits I will totally destroy and obliterate the economy of Turkey,\u201d Trump reassured the nation. Well, we\u2019ve always known he suffers from delusions of grandeur. (\u201cThere are those that think I\u2019m a very stable genius.\u201d) And although the way the administration handled the whole Turkey thing was wildly inept, we\u2019ve known for a long time there\u2019s no ept in this White House. But here\u2019s the other part: Donald Trump is in the middle of a super impeachment crisis, and he\u2019s surviving in office only through Senate Republicans\u2019 support. And he chose this time to create a foreign affairs uproar guaranteed to outrage and offend the Republican senators. \u201cPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration. This move ensures the emergence of ISIS,\u201d tweeted Lindsey Graham. This from a fervid supporter. If Graham were, say, a miniature poodle, he\u2019d be the one trotting along, carrying the master\u2019s socks in his mouth. The president\u2019s sudden decision to give a shout-out to the Turkish government came after a phone call with Erdogan. By now there have been so many phone-related disasters you\u2019d think the family would have taken away his communication devices. But Trump believes he\u2019s always very careful and conscious that tons of people are listening in. \u201cMy knowledge \u2014 I know all about it,\u201d he told reporters at a press conference last week. The gathering degenerated into a yelling meltdown, during which our president declared that House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff \u201chad some kind of a mental breakdown.\u201d Nobody muttered \u201ctakes one to know one.\u201d Most of the Republicans are just sort of curled up under their beds, quivering. Lately, the squad of across-the-board Trump defenders has dwindled down to people like Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida. Perhaps you remember Gaetz having argued that violence in America was not due to guns but to \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d This time he said that the impeachment process was \u201ca kangaroo court and chairman Schiff is acting like a malicious Captain Kangaroo.\u201d Well, you take whoever you can get and Trump does not currently have a lot of universally enthusiastic troops. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming called the American pullout from Syria a \u201ccatastrophic mistake.\u201d Any daughter of Dick Cheney is going to be a person who can overlook a whole lot. When you lose her, you\u2019re really down to \u2026 Matt Gaetz. All this is going on while the White House is refusing to let Congress have access to administration officials who have information on the whistle-blower charges. Which, as of course you remember, stem from the time the man who believes he knows all about being careful on phone calls tried to get the Ukraine president to come up with some dirt on the foreign business dealings of Joe Biden\u2019s son. The man who later demanded that China investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings there. Even China found that loony, a high standard for a country that can\u2019t even manage to have a reasonable relationship with basketball teams. And, of course, the president whose daughter and son-in-law have both been working for the White House while raking in tens of millions of dollars from their business dealings. Some came from the clothing Ivanka manufactured in places like \u2026 China. Why would he bring up children making money abroad? This isn\u2019t just a guy who makes stupid decisions. It\u2019s a guy who\u2019s off his rocker. Whose great pal is Rudy Giuliani, the talking head whose TV appearances can terrify toddlers. I\u2019m not saying Trump is the only unbalanced person in this story. Just that he\u2019s the only one who controls our nuclear weapons. In a happier time Americans went about their lives, complaining about Washington, then sort of shrugging and moving on to a discussion of the World Series. Or medieval history. Or goat yoga. Whatever. Now we aren\u2019t even free to change the subject. We\u2019re looking at the pileup and wondering whether the next thing will usher in the Big Crackup. So there\u2019s the president of the United States. Trying to get around the current controversy by rebranding the Turkish invasion \u201ca bad idea.\u201d Stonewalling Congress on the whistle-blower crisis. Which includes a report that one White House official who listened to Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president described it as \u2014 yes! \u2014 \u201ccrazy.\u201d What a coincidence.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s accounting firm must comply with a House committee\u2019s demands for eight years of his financial records, a federal appeals court panel ruled on Friday in a major victory for House Democrats in their struggle against his vow to stonewall \u201call\u201d of their oversight subpoenas. In a 66-page ruling, the panel rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s argument that Congress had no legitimate legislative authority to seek his business records from the firm, Mazars USA, because the committee was trying to determine whether he broke existing laws \u2014 not weighing whether to enact a new one. \u201cHaving considered the weighty issues at stake in this case, we conclude that the subpoena issued by the committee to Mazars is valid and enforceable,\u201d wrote Judge David S. Tatel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Mr. Trump is virtually certain to appeal the ruling, either to the full Court of Appeals or to the Supreme Court. But the decision \u2014 affirming an earlier ruling by a Federal District Court judge \u2014 was the first test at the appeals court level of the Trump legal team\u2019s sweeping challenges to the constitutional authority of Congress to conduct oversight of his activities. Judge Tatel was joined by Judge Patricia A. Millett in the majority of the three-judge ruling. Both were appointed by Democratic presidents. Judge Neomi Rao, a former Trump administration official whom Mr. Trump appointed to the bench in March, dissented, saying she would have quashed the subpoena as exceeding the House\u2019s legislative powers. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the Democratic chairman of the oversight committee, hailed the appeals court\u2019s decision. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a fundamental and resounding victory for congressional oversight, our constitutional system of checks and balances and the rule of law,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cFor far too long, the president has placed his personal interests over the interests of the American people.\u201d Lawyers for Mr. Trump were reviewing the decision, said one, Jay Sekulow. \u201cWe continue to believe that this subpoena is not a legitimate exercise of Congress\u2019s legislative authority,\u201d he said. Sarah E. Sutton, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined to comment on the ruling. The scope of Congress\u2019s power to compel the production of information \u2014 and the president\u2019s power to keep information secret \u2014 has emerged as a recurring battleground between House Democrats and Mr. Trump, whose legal team has put forth novel legal arguments in carrying out his vow to systematically defy House subpoenas. This week, Mr. Trump\u2019s White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, sent a letter to the House declaring that the administration would not cooperate with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, such as by providing documents or permitting witnesses to testify. The Trump legal team has separately argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s current and former White House aides are absolutely immune from subpoenas for their testimony \u2014 meaning they would not even have to show up \u2014 and that Congress lacks legitimate legislative authority to scrutinize potential wrongdoing in the executive branch. The appeals court ruling on Friday centered on that third argument, and it was in some respects already obsolete because the premise of the argument was that the House was relying only on its routine legislative and oversight authorities, rather than any extra investigative powers that lawmakers gain when engaged in an impeachment inquiry. But since the Mazars case started going through the courts, the House Judiciary Committee and Speaker Nancy Pelosi have declared that the chamber is conducting an impeachment inquiry. The Trump administration has disputed that premise, since the full House has not voted for a resolution approving such an investigation. Friday\u2019s ruling did not address the question of whether an impeachment inquiry is underway \u2014 and, if so, whether that matters. The majority on the panel ruled for the House without any need to invoke its impeachment powers. Specifically, the fight centered on whether the House Oversight and Reform Committee had the authority to compel Mazars to turn over Mr. Trump\u2019s financial records as part of its routine legislative and oversight powers, even if the committee\u2019s purpose was in part to determine whether Mr. Trump committed crimes. The committee, led by Mr. Cummings, issued the subpoena after it came to light that Mr. Trump had failed to list on his ethics disclosure forms a debt that he owed and then repaid to his former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, for paying hush money to a pornographic actress just before the 2016 election to keep quiet about an affair she claimed to have had with Mr. Trump. He has denied the relationship. Mr. Cohen also testified before Congress that Mr. Trump routinely changed the value of his assets for different financial purposes, like inflating their value for loan applications but deflating them for taxes. (Mr. Cohen was separately convicted of lying to Congress in earlier testimony.) In making the request for documents and then issuing the subpoena, Mr. Cummings said that Congress was trying to determine whether the president had broken laws, but he also said that lawmakers were trying to decide whether to update financial disclosure laws. Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, which sued Mazars to obtain a court order blocking it from complying with the subpoena, argued that this meant the committee was effectively trying to carry out a criminal investigation. That, they asserted, was an executive branch job, not a legislative one, and so the House\u2019s subpoena was invalid. But Judge Tatel wrote that Supreme Court precedent granted broad authority to Congress to issue subpoenas for information that could be used to enact new laws \u2014 even if it could also be useful as criminal evidence \u2014 and imposed no requirement on lawmakers to say that legislation was their specific purpose. In any case, he also wrote, Mr. Cummings had made reference to investigating whether new legislation was necessary. \u201cWe conclude that the public record reveals legitimate legislative pursuits, not an impermissible law enforcement purpose, behind the committee\u2019s subpoena,\u201d he wrote. Judge Rao disagreed. Lawyers for the House, led by their counsel Douglas Letter, had relied only on the House\u2019s normal oversight powers in support of the subpoena, she noted, arguing that permitting lawmakers to pursue such information without an impeachment inquiry would make it too easy to harass the presidency. \u201cWhen the House chooses to investigate the president for alleged violations of the laws and the Constitution, it must proceed through impeachment, an exceptional and solemn exercise of judicial power established as a separate check on public officials,\u201d she wrote. But Judge Rao did not address the House Democrats\u2019 more recent assertions that they are, in fact, already conducting an impeachment inquiry \u2014 nor the Trump administration\u2019s claims that there is no such inquiry for legal purposes. In a letter to Democrats celebrating the ruling, Ms. Pelosi wrote: \u201cThe president\u2019s actions threaten our national security, violate our Constitution and undermine the integrity of our elections. No one is above the law. The president will be held accountable.\u201d",

      "author": "Paul Krugman",
      "content": " The surprising thing about the constitutional crisis we\u2019re now facing is that it took so long to happen. It was obvious from early on that the president of the United States is a would-be autocrat who accepts no limits on his power and considers criticism a form of treason, and he is backed by a party that has denied the legitimacy of its opposition for many years. Something like this moment was inevitable. What still hangs in the balance is the outcome. And if democracy survives \u2014 which is by no means certain \u2014 it will largely be thanks to one unpredictable piece of good luck: Donald Trump\u2019s mental deficiency. I don\u2019t mean that Trump is stupid; a stupid man couldn\u2019t have managed to defraud so many people over so many years. Nor do I mean that he\u2019s crazy, although his speeches and tweets (\u201cmy great and unmatched wisdom\u201d; the Kurds weren\u2019t there on D-Day) keep sounding loonier. He is, however, lazy, utterly incurious and too insecure to listen to advice or ever admit to a mistake. And given that he is in fact what he accuses others of being \u2014 an enemy of the people \u2014 we should be thankful for his flaws. The news item that got me thinking along these lines was, oddly, the latest budget review from the Congressional Budget Office, projecting a fiscal 2019 deficit of almost a trillion dollars \u2014 up by more than $300 billion from the deficit Trump inherited. Never mind the clear demonstration that the G.O.P.\u2019s Obama-era hyperventilating about deficits was completely hypocritical. The more important point is that $300 billion is a lot of money, and it should have been enough to buy Trump a lot of political gain. After all, other white nationalists trying to do what Trump is trying to do \u2014 subvert the rule of law and convert their nations from democracies on paper to one-party autocracies in practice \u2014 have solidified their grasp on power by delivering at least a bit on their populist promises. In Poland, for example, the Law and Justice party has increased social spending and is now promising a big rise in the minimum wage. Trump\u2019s domestic economic policy, however, has been standard Republican top-down class warfare. None of that $300 billion went for social benefits or even his continually promised, never-delivered infrastructure plan. Instead, it went mainly into tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy that have done little to boost investment. [For an even deeper look at what\u2019s on Paul Krugman\u2019s mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.] At the same time, Trump has pursued his personal tariff obsession despite mounting evidence that it\u2019s hurting growth. The economy was supposed to be his big political selling point. Instead, polls of his net job approval on economic policy are, on average, barely positive even now \u2014 and likely to get worse as tariffs on consumer goods bite and the economy slows. But Trump\u2019s squandered economic opportunities are, of course, secondary at this point to his de facto self-impeachment. Just a few weeks ago it seemed that Trump would skate on charges both of colluding with Russia to subvert the 2016 election and of obstruction of justice; the Mueller report was basically a bust, partly because the story was complicated, partly because of Robert Mueller\u2019s diffidence. But Trump has managed to make things clear enough for everyone to understand. First he demanded that foreign regimes produce dirt on domestic political rivals, not just in phone calls but right there on camera. Now he\u2019s engaged in a crude, obvious effort to stonewall the House impeachment inquiry that is clearly an impeachable offense in itself. Why did he hand the defenders of democracy so much ammunition? Partly he seems to have gotten high on his own supply \u2014 he actually seems to believe the bizarre conspiracy theories his supporters drum up to excuse his actions. Also, he evidently lacks any kind of self-restraint. Even if he considers any effort to hold him accountable a form of treason, he should have known better than to blurt it out in public. So Trump\u2019s own actions explain why a vote to impeach, which seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago, now looks almost inevitable. Conviction in the Senate is still unlikely, but not as impossible as it once appeared. The larger point is that if Trump were cannier and more self-controlled, the march to autocracy might well be unstoppable. He has the backing of a party whose elected representatives have shown no sign of democratic scruples. He has de facto state media in the form of Fox News and the rest of the Murdoch empire. He has already managed to corrupt key government agencies, including the Justice Department. Indeed, these advantages are so large that the assault on democracy may yet prevail. The only reason it might falter is, as I said, Trump\u2019s own deficiencies. It says a lot about the modern G.O.P. that the party is still solidly behind a man so obviously, grotesquely, not up to the job (although some rank-and-file Republicans now back an impeachment inquiry). But those of us who want America as we know it to survive should be grateful that Trump is so immature and incompetent. His character flaws are the only thing that gives us a fighting chance.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Saturday night took his post-impeachment message of grievance and political warfare directly to the religious right, telling a group of social conservatives that Democrats were trying to undo the results of the 2016 campaign and \u201cstop our movement and impose their agenda by any means necessary.\u201d For the third consecutive night, Mr. Trump delivered a version of his combative response to the formal beginning of an impeachment inquiry declared last month by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, this time during an official presidential speech at the Values Voter Summit, an annual gathering of social conservatives in Washington. \u201cI think she hates our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Ms. Pelosi. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t hate our country, she wouldn\u2019t be doing this to our country. It\u2019s a fraud.\u201d After months of restraint, Ms. Pelosi last month charged Mr. Trump with betraying the nation\u2019s security by seeking to enlist a foreign government to damage a political rival for his own gain. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks came after two nights of raucous campaign rallies, one in the progressive city of Minneapolis, and another in the deep-red district of Lake Charles, La. But at an official White House event on Saturday night, Mr. Trump delivered an almost indistinguishable message from behind a podium with a presidential seal. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see or hear that word with regard to me,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cImpeachment. To me, it\u2019s an ugly word. It means so much; it means horrible, horrible crimes and things. I can\u2019t even believe it.\u201d From the start, the gathering was a chance for the president to frame the fast-moving impeachment inquiry as the latest chapter of a continuing effort by Democrats to damage him. At the event put on by the Family Research Council, Mr. Trump was introduced with a prayer for the Lord to \u201cexpose and reverse the plans of those who would hurt President Trump.\u201d Mr. Trump, who spoke for well over an hour on Saturday night, described himself as the innocent victim of a partisan conspiracy. \u201cFirst, it was the Russia hoax,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it was the outrageous smearing of Justice Kavanaugh.\u201d Mr. Trump said that \u201cnow it is the outrageous impeachment\u201d and added that \u201cthe hateful spirit that consumes the modern left violates every tenet of the American tradition.\u201d Later on Saturday night, Mr. Trump also gave a phone interview to the Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, making him one of the sole and omnipresent voices in the White House mounting a defense of his actions and an assault on Democrats as the impeachment inquiry barrels forward. Last weekend, Trump administration officials were absent from the cable news shows. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have TV interviews scheduled for Sunday. But Mr. Trump has emerged, so far, as something of a one-man war room setting the tone for the White House\u2019s rebuttal to a constitutional and political showdown that could reshape his presidency and his legacy. On Saturday night, Mr. Trump did not attack former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., who is a central character in the House impeachment inquiry, which is investigating Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to come up with damaging information about the former vice president. But he singled out Ms. Pelosi, as well as Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a favorite progressive foil he likes to hold up as an avatar for her party. \u201cLook at Omar, have you seen what she says?\u201d Mr. Trump said, accusing her of harboring deep anti-Semitic sentiments. \u201cShe meant it much more so than even her words,\u201d he said. He also accused Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, of \u201clying and cheating\u201d and said he had instructed his lawyers to sue him as a public relations gambit. \u201cI told my lawyers, sue him anyway, even if we lose the American public will understand,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump reverted to the coarse language he has employed in arena rally settings, even as he spoke in front of a religious audience. \u201cOther countries are looking at us like, what the hell is going on in the United States,\u201d he said. But he promised the audience that he would continue to defend religious liberty and that \u201cwe will win massive victories for family, faith \u2014 just like the victory we had in 2016.\u201d",

      "content": "   President Trump\u2019s surprise acquiescence to a Turkish incursion into northern Syria this week has shaken American allies, and not just because it was a betrayal of a loyal partner. What alarmed them even more was his sheer unpredictability. His inconsistent and rapidly shifting positions in the Middle East have injected a new element of chaos into an already volatile region and have left allies guessing where the United States stands and for how long. Previous American policymakers were clear about their intentions, said Mowaffak al-Rubaie, a former Iraqi national security adviser. \u201cThis guy is all emotional,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unpredictable.\u201d The uncertainties only compound simmering worries about the durability of the American commitment to the Middle East. American presidents have been promising for almost 15 years to reduce the country\u2019s presence in the region, unnerving partners like Israel and the Persian Gulf monarchs that rely on American protection. But few American leaders have ever made and disclosed major foreign policy decisions with the speed and seeming improvisation that Mr. Trump does. No longer merely worried that Washington might withdraw, analysts say many allies are now concerned that this unpredictable commander in chief could bolt for an exit without warning. His decision to get out of the way of the Turkish incursion was apparently made on the spur of the moment during a phone call with the Turkish president, surprising many of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. It opened the door to a fierce Turkish assault on the American-backed militia led by the Syrian Kurds, which was key to the ground battle to retake territory captured by the Islamic State. Attacking the Kurds, in turn, risks an Islamic State comeback. This was just the latest in a series of flip-flops in American policy in the region, including two in Syria this year alone. In December, Mr. Trump promised to withdraw the entire contingent of about 2000 American forces there. But he later changed his mind, withdrawing about half. He has repeatedly warned that the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for military action against Iran. But when Iran shot down an American surveillance drone this summer, Mr. Trump reversed himself in the final minutes to call off a planned missile strike. Then last month, he denounced Iran for orchestrating an attack on Saudi oil facilities but declined to take military action. His hesitance made America\u2019s two most important allies in the region, Saudi Arabia and Israel, reassess the American commitment to the containment of Iran and, consequently, to their own security. Critics say that Mr. Trump\u2019s zigzagging policies have emboldened regional foes, unnerved American partners, and invited Russia and various regional players to seek to exert their influence. \u201cIt is chaos,\u201d said Michael Stephens, a scholar of the region at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cThe region is in chaos because the hegemonic power does not seem to know what it wants to do, and so nobody else does.\u201d Even in Britain, which customarily keeps its Middle East policies tightly aligned with its superpower ally, \u201cnobody knows what to do any more, because you don\u2019t know what is coming next,\u201d Mr. Stephens said. \u201cDonald Trump is pouring gasoline on the fire and leaving a lot of us very confused.\u201d In his public defenses of his decision, Mr. Trump insists he is acting consistently and has suggested that he was fulfilling a campaign promise to get out of open-ended conflicts around the Middle East. \u201cI was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don\u2019t even like the USA,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Monday. To critics, his shifting defenses of his decision are reminders of his fickleness. When Mr. Trump backed away from his decision to withdraw all American troops remaining in Syria, he appeared to accept the admonitions of his military chiefs and advisers about the dire consequences of an abrupt pull out. The presence of American troops in northern Syria had helped to preserve the area as a safe haven for the Kurdish-led militia that has been Washington\u2019s most critical ally on the ground in the fight against ISIS. Now that Kurdish-led militia is acting as jailers for tens of thousands of ISIS fighters and their families being held in camps and prisons in northern Syria near the Turkish border. The leaders of neighboring Turkey, which has battled Kurdish separatists at home for decades, saw the Syrian Kurdish militia as a threat and talked openly of a cross border campaign to crush it \u2014 if only the American troops got out of the way. But despite the warnings about a United States interest in protecting its loyal Kurdish allies and in containing the ISIS prisoners, Mr. Trump this week portrayed the plights of the Kurds as someone else\u2019s problem. Referring to the Turks and Kurds as \u201cnatural enemies,\u201d he said, \u201cIt is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own country.\u201d As soon as Mr. Trump moved the fewer than a hundred American troops from a border area, Turkey unleashed its cross border assault on Wednesday. By Friday, there was evidence that ISIS was already attempting to regroup amid the chaos. Five militants had escaped from a Kurdish-run prison and ISIS claimed responsibility for a bombing in a provincial capital. With the White House still reeling from the withering criticism aimed at President Trump by his fellow Republicans for essentially abandoning America\u2019s Kurdish allies, the administration announced on Saturday evening that it would release $50 million in \u201cstabilization assistance for Syria to protect persecuted ethnic and religious minorities, and advance human rights.\u201d Syria has not been a direct recipient of American aid in years, and the announcement said little about how it would be spent. But it was clear that it was a response to critiques that by pulling back on the American military presence in the Kurdish-controlled areas, Mr. Trump unleashed a military and humanitarian crisis. The White House said the funds would help \u201cSyrian human rights defenders, civil society organizations, and reconciliation efforts directly supporting ethnic and religious minority victims of the conflict.\u201d And it discussed removing \u201cexplosive remnants of war, community security for stabilization assistance, documenting human rights abuses and international humanitarian law violations, and support for survivors of gender-based violence and torture.\u201d But it sidestepped the issue of how to make such aid work on the ground in the midst of conflict. And some of Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security aides warned of further troubles. \u201cWe have got to keep the pressure on ISIS so they don\u2019t recover,\u201d former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said in a pretaped interview for NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Mr. Mattis, who resigned late last year when Mr. Trump first announced a Syria withdrawal, suggested that the president\u2019s political desires to pull back troops was risky. \u201dWe may want a war over; we may even declare it over,\u201d Mr. Mattis said. \u201cYou can pull your troops out \u2014 as President Obama learned the hard way \u2014 out of Iraq, but the \u2018enemy gets the vote\u2019, we say in the military. And in this case, if we don\u2019t keep the pressure on, then ISIS will resurge.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a given that they will come back,\u201d he concluded. The decision to allow the Turkish advance came less than a month after Mr. Trump spooked American partners in the region by appearing to back down from another confrontation, that one against Iran. Mr. Trump has levied sweeping economic sanctions against Iran since May in an attempt to coerce its leaders into accepting strict restrictions on their military capabilities and nuclear energy program. During the escalating confrontation over the sanctions, he has frequently expressed a willingness to use military force against Iran. Then, according to the administration, Iran retaliated against the American sanctions by orchestrating a missile strike against the most important oil facility of Washington\u2019s most important Arab ally, Saudi Arabia. And Mr. Trump disclaimed any responsibility. \u201cThat was an attack on Saudi Arabia, and that wasn\u2019t an attack on us,\u201d he said. Other countries are scurrying to adapt to the new reality. \u201cI think many nations around the Middle East now are considering major changes in their strategic defense plans because they no longer see the United States as a reliable ally,\u201d said Gamal Abdel Gawad Soltan, an adviser to the state-sponsored Al Ahram Center for Strategic Studies in Cairo. \u201cI think it will be very difficult to convince nations of the Middle East that the United States is serious about what it says, and this is a major change in the strategic landscape of the Middle East.\u201d America\u2019s enemies, some analysts say, may also be taking note. \u201cIf you are someone that is a rival on the other side \u2014 you\u2019re Iranian, Russian, Turkish, ISIS, Hezbollah \u2014 you understand that this is the time for gain,\u201d argued Shimrit Meir, columnist for the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot. \u201cThis is the hour. Because when the president of the United States is going all the way, saying \u2018I hate military interference in the Middle East, and this is why I was elected, to stop this\u2019 \u2014 then it\u2019s not rocket science for the Iranians to understand that they have a lot of room for maneuver.\u201d American involvement in the Middle East rose steadily after the United States emerged as a superpower at the end of World War II. But since the American military presence in the region reached its apex with the invasion of Iraq in 2003, presidents from both parties have tried to cut back. President Obama sought to pull out of Afghanistan but instead sent a surge of more troops to try to achieve enough stability to ease a withdrawal \u2014 a gambit that failed to achieve that goal. He withdrew American troops from Iraq in 2011. But his critics say the pullout enabled the emergence of the Islamic State, which seized a large portion of Iraq and Syria in 2014, drawing the United States military back in. Mr. Obama\u2019s experience might now serve as a cautionary tale to Mr. Trump, who risks allowing a resurgence of the Islamic State by pulling back in Syria, argued Michele Dunne, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama \u201cwas terribly consistent \u2014 he said from the beginning that he wanted to pull the U.S. troops out of Iraq.\u201d Phillip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the Middle East coordinator for the Obama White House, acknowledged that pulling back from the Middle East turned out to be easier said than done. But he said he had marveled that President Trump had managed to campaign promising both to pull back from Middle Eastern conflicts and at the same time to push back more aggressively against regional foes. \u201cYou can\u2019t do those two things at the same time,\u201d Mr. Gordon said, and in Mr. Trump\u2019s policies toward the conflicts in Syria and with Iran this fall \u201cthat enormous contradiction is coming back to haunt him.\u201d Critics say that the Trump administration has been inconsistent toward the Middle East before. When Persian Gulf neighbors sought to isolate Qatar in 2017, members of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet urged them to end the dispute but the president himself applauded it. He later ordered airstrikes against Syria to punish its government for using chemical weapons against rebel groups but he failed to respond after Washington confirmed another use of chemical weapons earlier this year. When a Libyan militia leader launched an attack on the country\u2019s internationally recognized government six months ago, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke out against it. President Trump, a few days later, announced that he had called the militia leader and commended his \u201congoing counterterrorism efforts.\u201d Mr. al-Rubaie, the former Iraqi national security adviser, said that two wars, billions of dollars in spending, and the expense of thousands of Americans lives should have made Iraq the \u201ccrown\u201d of United States policy on the Middle East. But Mr. Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t see Iraq\u201d and instead focuses only on the degree of Iranian influence. The Iraqis \u201cfeel let down. They feel that these people have left them and left the country. They left them high and dry,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the Americans, their friends are disposable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Americans, you look for them and they look for the closest exit. You turn around and you don\u2019t find them.\u201d",

      "content": " House Democrats are inching closer to a formal impeachment inquiry, as if that\u2019s how best to exorcise Donald Trump from the body politic. Mark Sanford just became the third Republican to announce a 2020 primary challenge and to dream of a successful insurrection against an emperor  whom most of the party meekly obeys. And 10 Democrats will take the stage on Thursday night for their party\u2019s next presidential debate, each determined to present himself or herself as the surest route to the far side of Trump. So now is as good a time as any to state what should be obvious to anyone who has considered Trump\u2019s psychology, registered his megalomania and taken full account of his behavior to date. We will never, ever be rid of him. Oh, sure, we may remove him from the presidency, which is no small thing. But that won\u2019t get him out of the nation\u2019s bloodstream. It sure as hell won\u2019t shut him up. If you think he has demolished all the norms of what it means to be the president of the United States, just wait until you see the sledgehammer he takes to the traditional role and restraint of former presidents. He won\u2019t be at an easel in remote Texas, like George W. Bush. He won\u2019t be biting his tongue and taking big, deep, centering breaths, like Barack Obama. A foundation devoted to good works? Been there, done that, and it was a perfect mirror of the man, which is to say a complete sham. It\u2019s under investigation by the State of New York. No, he\u2019ll be tweeting, bleating, ranting and raging in precisely the manner that he is now, just without the nuclear codes. And if that transition happens after November 2020, he\u2019ll declare the election suspect, fraudulent, the result of a media crusade against him, the fruit of illegal votes. He pressed that narrative in 2016 even though he was declared the victor. A winner that sore is poised to be an epically nasty loser, and I have an easier time imagining a \u201cThelma and Louise\u201d remake starring Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin than I do the Trumps graciously beckoning the Warrens across the threshold of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. [Get a more personal take on politics, newsmakers and more with Frank Bruni\u2019s exclusive commentary every week. Sign up for his newsletter.] The post-Trump landscape \u2014 or, rather, the impossibility of one \u2014 is on my mind in part because of a prediction by Brad Parscale, the manager of the Trump 2020 campaign, at a California Republican convention last weekend. \u201cThe Trumps will be a dynasty that will last for decades, propelling the Republican Party into a new party,\u201d he said in a speech to delegates. Then The Atlantic published a riveting cover story by McKay Coppins that in some ways raised the same prospect, reporting that Ivanka and Don Jr. are jockeying to be their dad\u2019s rightful political heir and noting that the Trump progeny are genetically wired to wring every last droplet from their father\u2019s celebrity that they can. Flashing back to the night in November 2016 when the family watched the election returns, Coppins wrote that they were in shock, because Trump \u201cwas supposed to go down in a spectacular blaze of made-for-TV martyrdom that all of them could capitalize on. Ivanka had a book coming out. Don and Eric were working on a line of patriotically themed budget hotels. And preliminary talks were underway to launch a Trump-branded TV network that would turn disgruntled voters into viewers. Now they needed a new plan.\u201d Apparently it\u2019s one modeled after the Kennedys and the Bushes, only with a much bigger budget for hair and makeup. Best of luck, Trumpkins. I just don\u2019t see it. Ivanka \u2014 or, as I like to think of her, Our Lady of the DMZ \u2014 has shown a shocking tone-deafness during her White House romp. And Don Jr. was the nitwit emailing ecstatically and then lying badly about that June 2016 meeting with the Russian, um, adoption evangelists. These two have all of Dad\u2019s gall but only a scintilla of his guile. Trump won\u2019t hang around by proxy, in a next generation of opportunists with his surname or agenda. That would negate the whole point of his pivot into politics. It wasn\u2019t to promote ideas; it was to promote himself. Health permitting, he\u2019ll move heaven and earth to maintain his omnipresence in American life, by which I mean he\u2019ll be as outrageous as he must to stay in the news. And we in the media will confront a decision: Give him what he wants, or let go of him and all the eyeballs he draws? Even if we let go, there\u2019s the strong possibility, as Coppins noted, that he\u2019ll establish his own media enterprise, with a network where the news really is fake, adulation doesn\u2019t hinge on nuisances like the ballot box and Sean Hannity isn\u2019t the model for Trump veneration. He\u2019s the baseline. From that coddled perch Trump can take out his big black Sharpie and write higher vote counts over his actual, official ones. He can draw horns on John Bolton and a halo over William Barr. He can sketch a second White House adjacent to the first one but taller, with gold trim. That\u2019s where he\u2019ll be living, his power fictive but his presence ineluctable, snappily ever after.",

      "content": " If investigators are going to get their hands on President Trump\u2019s tax returns, they will have to find them somewhere other than Deutsche Bank. The German bank \u2014 which for nearly two decades was the only mainstream financial institution consistently willing to lend money to Mr. Trump \u2014 has told a federal appeals court that it does not have the president\u2019s personal tax returns, the court said on Thursday. Democratic-controlled congressional committees issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank this year for financial records related to the president, his companies and his family. Mr. Trump sued the bank, which became his main lender after a string of bankruptcies cost other banks hundreds of millions of dollars, to block it from complying. That litigation is working its way through the federal courts. Last month, The New York Times and other media outlets asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York to unseal a letter from Deutsche Bank that identified two members of the Trump family whose tax returns the bank possesses. On Thursday, the court rejected the request. Part of the reason, it said, was that Deutsche Bank had informed the court that \u201cthe only tax returns it has for individuals and entities named in the subpoenas are not those of the president.\u201d Current and former bank officials previously told The Times that Deutsche Bank had portions of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and corporate tax returns. The bank collected at least some of those tax records in 2011, when Deutsche Bank\u2019s private-banking arm \u2014 which caters to the ultra-wealthy \u2014 took on Mr. Trump as a client. The returns and other financial documents were reviewed by a number of bank executives, according to the current and former officials. Deutsche Bank relied on the information provided in the tax returns and other financial documents to approve a series of loans to Mr. Trump in early 2012 in connection with his Doral golf resort in Florida and his Chicago skyscraper. Over the ensuing years, Deutsche Bank\u2019s private-banking arm continued lending to Mr. Trump, including $170 million in 2014 to convert the Old Post Office building, a few blocks from the White House, into a hotel. By the time Mr. Trump was sworn in as president, he owed the bank more than $300 million, making it his largest creditor. It is unclear when Deutsche Bank stopped retaining Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns. A former senior bank executive, who said he had seen the returns, said the normal practice was for Deutsche Bank to keep such materials on file. Troy Gravitt, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, said the bank was \u201ccommitted to cooperating with authorized investigations.\u201d Breaking with decades of presidential precedent, Mr. Trump has refused to publicly disclose his federal tax returns, and Democrats are keen to obtain the documents, believing they are crucial to unlocking his closely guarded financial secrets. Mr. Trump is fighting those efforts. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers sued Deutsche Bank and another lender, Capital One, to block them from complying with subpoenas that were issued in April by the House Intelligence and Financial Services Committees. The Financial Services Committee has said it wants to know whether Mr. Trump helped Russians and other foreign real estate buyers launder money through his properties, and the Intelligence Committee is trying to determine whether Mr. Trump\u2019s financial dealings made him subject to foreign influence. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have argued the subpoenas have no legitimate legislative purpose. During one hearing, judges from the appeals court asked the banks\u2019 lawyers whether they had copies of Mr. Trump\u2019s returns, and requested a written answer. Deutsche Bank released a partly redacted letter saying it did have at least draft versions of some returns covered by the subpoenas, prompting the news media requests for the information to be unsealed. Investigators seeking Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns have other avenues to pursue. Another congressional committee and the Manhattan district attorney have subpoenaed Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA, for his tax returns. Mr. Trump has sued to block those subpoenas as well; on Monday, a federal judge sided with the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, but Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers quickly appealed. The House Ways and Means Committee asked the I.R.S. this year to hand over six years of Mr. Trump\u2019s returns. The Treasury Department has refused that request.",

With Michelle Goldberg out on assignment, fellow Op-Ed columnist Jamelle Bouie returns to \u201cThe Argument\u201d to discuss Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw American troops from Syria and his defiance in the face of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. The Syria decision was particularly ill advised because it alienated Republican lawmakers and elements of the president\u2019s base at a critical time, argues Ross Douthat. Jamelle thinks Trump\u2019s behavior is likely to become increasingly volatile as public support for impeachment grows. And David Leonhardt wants to see more ex-administration officials speak out against their former boss\u2019s chaotic moves. Then, with the conservative-leaning Supreme Court back in session and a slew of big cases on the docket, the columnists debate whether Democrats should answer Republicans\u2019 constitutional hardball with their own. And finally, as a movie set in the dark and gritty New York of the 1980s dominates the box office, Jamelle recommends a star-studded, similarly set film made closer to the era it depicts. Background Reading: I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \u201creasonable\u201d elites. I\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife. I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter. I\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at Businessweek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot. My politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.

      "content": "   Last month, the Trump family business received approval from a local government in Scotland for a major expansion of its golf resort near Aberdeen, marking the largest real estate development financed by the Trump Organization since the 2016 election. In August, President Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Jr., flew to Jakarta to help kick-start sales at a pair of Trump-branded luxury resorts planned for Indonesia. He appeared at a private event with wealthy prospective buyers and joined his politically connected billionaire Indonesian business partner at a news conference. And last year, Donald Jr. visited India to sell condos at future Trump-branded towers, appearing at an event that also featured India\u2019s prime minister. \u201cI\u2019m here as a businessman,\u201d Mr. Trump told the gathering in New Delhi. \u201cI\u2019m not representing anyone.\u201d But for the children of the politically powerful, personal business and public dealings can often be indistinguishable, especially when private projects depend on foreign governments that are looking to bolster ties with Washington. In recent weeks, as the president has become embroiled in a scandal involving his interactions with Ukraine, Donald Trump Jr. and his brother Eric have taken to attacking Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., for his business dealings in Ukraine and China. The brothers have accused him of leveraging his family name for personal gain while his father served in the Obama administration. Among other things, Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that has been a focus of Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in the country. \u201cAt the VERY LEAST, there\u2019s the appearance of impropriety,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter. \u201cA clear conflict of interest.\u201d At a rally in Minneapolis on Thursday, Eric Trump\u2019s charged remarks about the former vice president\u2019s son inspired the crowd of Trump supporters to chant, \u201cLock him up!\u201d Republicans, led by the president, have sought to make Hunter Biden\u2019s international business dealings an issue in the impeachment debate in Washington. But the high-profile attack roles being played by Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest sons have now thrust their own business dealings into the spotlight too. Both sons have operated and promoted the Trump family business overseas during their father\u2019s presidency, even as he retains ownership. And while the Trump and Biden father-son relationships differ in many ways, the business dealings have set up a simple parallel. \u201cThey are criticizing the vice president\u2019s son for doing exactly what they are doing themselves,\u201d said Martin Ford, a member of the Aberdeenshire Council in Scotland, which voted last month to approve a proposal by the Trumps to build a 500-unit housing development. \u201cThey are conducting international business here in Scotland.\u201d Eric Trump, in a statement to The New York Times, said there was a distinction between his father\u2019s career in business, with his recent turn to politics, and Mr. Biden\u2019s decades in public office. \u201cWhen my father became president, our family stopped doing international business deals,\u201d he said, a reference to a pledge by the Trump Organization not to begin new overseas projects during the Trump presidency. Hunter Biden, he said, did the opposite when his father became vice president. The Trump business activities in India, Indonesia and Scotland were considered in compliance with the pledge, according to the company\u2019s ethics rules, because they were building on deals already in the works. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign declined to comment on Friday. But in a tweet, the former vice president once again suggested that the attacks on his son were part of a political smear campaign. \u201cLet me make something clear to President Trump: I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me. And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how dirty the attacks get.\u201d Conducting business on the international stage has long been standard for the Trump Organization, which has placed the Trump name on hotels and towers in several countries. But its international dealings have become far more complicated since Mr. Trump took office and his sons took leadership of the business, especially when foreign governments have been involved to the company\u2019s benefit. When the Trump Organization tangled with the majority owner of a property in Panama, for example, its local lawyers at one point called on the Panamanian president for an assist. In Indonesia, the government is helping to build a major new highway that will make a new Trump development more accessible. Construction is scheduled to begin soon on what will be known as Trump Residences Lido, which will include 280 homes, a golf course and a hotel, south of Jakarta. The Trump family\u2019s partner in Indonesia \u2014 a billionaire named Hary Tanoesoedibjo \u2014 is financing the project, with the Trump family getting a cut of the sales. In marketing materials released this summer, which featured the Trump family logo and a photograph of Donald Trump Jr., the company noted that the \u201cTrump Residences Lido can be accessed directly through the newly opened Bocimi Toll Road.\u201d In Scotland, the Aberdeenshire Council recently dropped an earlier requirement that the new housing development could not be built until the Trumps spent tens of millions of dollars on other investments at the resort. Sebastian Leslie, a local official who supported the project, said the family received no special consideration. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that \u2014 we don\u2019t give anybody special favors,\u201d Mr. Leslie said. But Mr. Martin, a council member who opposed the approval, said the Trumps benefited handsomely from the change. \u201cIt is a much, much more lucrative deal now,\u201d he said. Revenues coming to the Trump family in the United States have drawn scrutiny too, including at the Trump International Hotel in Washington \u2014 a property, opened in the final stages of the 2016 campaign, that has flourished while Donald Trump Jr. and Eric have run the company. The hotel has been a magnet for Republican lobbyists and political fund-raisers, and companies and foreign officials with business before the Trump administration have thrown parties there, including the Kuwait embassy and the government of Azerbaijan. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka has also retained a stake in the family business even as she serves as a White House adviser, and last year she received trademarks in China related to her separate fashion ventures. Her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, maintains a stake in his own family\u2019s real estate business, which has received and sought funding from international sources as well. In 2017, Mr. Kushner met privately at the White House with top executives from Citibank and the private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Those meetings came as the firms were contemplating sizable loans to his family\u2019s business, Kushner Companies, which they did eventually make. And since Mr. Kushner entered the White House, his family has courted state-connected investors in China and the Middle East \u2014 both regions that were in Mr. Kushner\u2019s government portfolio \u2014 to bail out the firm\u2019s headquarters at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. But the presidency has also come with some costs for the Trump family business since the sons have been at the helm. The company had been banking on global expansion to drive its growth, but when the president agreed to put a hold on new foreign deals, it curtailed those ambitions for his sons. George Sorial, the company\u2019s chief compliance counsel when the policy was developed, said it was the right thing to do even though it was not required by law and had cost the company significantly. Eric Trump, in his statement to The Times, suggested that even the decision to forgo new foreign deals could be seen through the prism of Hunter Biden. \u201cMy father was one of the most famous businessmen on earth and he sacrificed billions to be our president,\u201d he said. \u201cJoe Biden was an incredibly influential politician \u2014 his family made millions.\u201d The Biden campaign also sees opportunity in the nasty dispute. In a fund-raising email sent on Friday, the campaign singled out the Trump sons and the \u201clock him up\u201d chant at the Thursday rally. \u201cWe are fighting back against this nonsense as hard as we know how every single day,\u201d the campaign wrote.",

      "content": " On Sept. 1, with a Category 5 hurricane off the Atlantic coast, an angry wind was issuing from the direction of President Trump\u2019s Twitter account. The apparent emergency: Debra Messing, the co-star of \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d had tweeted that \u201cthe public has a right to know\u201d who is attending a Beverly Hills fund-raiser for Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election. \u201cI have not forgotten that when it was announced that I was going to do The Apprentice, and when it then became a big hit, Helping NBC\u2019s failed lineup greatly, @DebraMessing came up to me at an Upfront & profusely thanked me, even calling me \u2018Sir,\u2019 \u201d wrote the 45th president of the United States. It was a classic Trumpian ragetweet: aggrieved over a minor slight, possibly prompted by a Fox News segment, unverifiable \u2014 he has a long history of questionable tales involving someone calling him \u201cSir\u201d \u2014 and nostalgic for his primetime-TV heyday. (By Thursday he was lashing Ms. Messing again, as Hurricane Dorian was lashing the Carolinas.) [James Poniewozik answered questions about this essay on Twitter: part I, part II] This sort of outburst, almost three years into his presidency, has kept people puzzling over who the \u201creal\u201d Mr. Trump is and how he actually thinks. Should we take him, to quote the famous precept of Trumpology, literally or seriously? Are his attacks impulsive tantrums or strategic distractions from his other woes? Is he playing 3-D chess or Rock \u2019Em Sock \u2019Em Robots? This is a futile effort. Try to understand Donald Trump as a person with psychology and strategy and motivation, and you will inevitably spiral into confusion and covfefe. The key is to remember that Donald Trump is not a person. He\u2019s a TV character. I mean, O.K., there is an actual person named Donald John Trump, with a human body and a childhood and formative experiences that theoretically a biographer or therapist might usefully delve into someday. (We can only speculate about the latter; Mr. Trump has boasted on Twitter of never having seen a psychiatrist, preferring the therapeutic effects of \u201chit[ting] \u2018sleazebags\u2019 back.\u201d) But that Donald Trump is of limited significance to America and the world. The \u201cDonald Trump\u201d who got elected president, who has strutted and fretted across the small screen since the 1980s, is a decades-long media performance. To understand him, you need to approach him less like a psychologist and more like a TV critic. He was born in 1946, at the same time that American broadcast TV was being born. He grew up with it. His father, Fred, had one of the first color TV sets in Jamaica Estates. In \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d Donald Trump recalls his mother, Mary Anne, spending a day in front of the tube, enraptured by the coronation of Queen Elizabeth in 1953. (\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, Mary,\u201d he remembers his father saying, \u201cEnough is enough, turn it off. They\u2019re all a bunch of con artists.\u201d) TV was his soul mate. It was like him. It was packed with the razzle-dazzle and action and violence that captivated him. He dreamed of going to Hollywood, then he shelved those dreams in favor of his father\u2019s business and vowed, according to the book \u201cTrumpNation\u201d by Timothy O\u2019Brien, to \u201cput show business into real estate.\u201d As TV evolved from the homogeneous three-network mass medium of the mid-20th century to the polarized zillion-channel era of cable-news fisticuffs and reality shocker-tainment, he evolved with it. In the 1980s, he built a media profile as an insouciant, high-living apex predator. In 1990, he described his yacht and gilded buildings to Playboy as \u201cProps for the show \u2026 The show is \u2018Trump\u2019 and it is sold-out performances everywhere.\u201d He syndicated that show to Oprah, Letterman, NBC, WrestleMania and Fox News. Everything he achieved, he achieved by using TV as a magnifying glass, to make himself appear bigger than he was. He was able to do this because he thought like a TV camera. He knew what TV wanted, what stimulated its nerve endings. In his campaign rallies, he would tell The Washington Post, he knew just what to say \u201cto keep the red light on\u201d: that is, the light on a TV camera that showed that it was running, that you mattered. Bomb the [redacted] out of them! I\u2019d like to punch him in the face! The red light radiated its approval. Cable news aired the rallies start to finish. For all practical purposes, he and the camera shared the same brain. Even when he adopted social media, he used it like TV. First, he used it like a celebrity, to broadcast himself, his first tweet in 2009 promoting a \u201cLate Show With David Letterman\u201d appearance. Then he used it like an instigator, tweeting his birther conspiracies before he would talk about them on Fox News, road-testing his call for a border wall during the cable-news fueled Ebola and border panics of the 2014 midterms. When he was a candidate, and especially when he was president, his tweets programmed TV and were amplified by it. On CNBC, a \u201cBREAKING NEWS: TRUMP TWEET\u201d graphic would spin out onscreen as soon as the words left his thumbs. He would watch Fox News, or Lou Dobbs, or CNN or \u201cMorning Joe\u201d or \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t watch\u201d), and get mad, and tweet. Then the tweets would become TV, and he would watch it, and tweet again. If you want to understand what President Trump will do in any situation, then, it\u2019s more helpful to ask: What would TV do? What does TV want? It wants conflict. It wants excitement. If there is something that can blow up, it should blow up. It wants a fight. It wants more. It is always eating and never full. Some presidential figure-outers, trying to understand the celebrity president through a template that they were already familiar with, have compared him with Ronald Reagan: a \u201cmaster showman\u201d cannily playing a \u201crole.\u201d The comparison is understandable, but it\u2019s wrong. Presidents Reagan and Trump were both entertainers who applied their acts to politics. But there\u2019s a crucial difference between what \u201cplaying a character\u201d means in the movies and what it means on reality TV. Ronald Reagan was an actor. Actors need to believe deeply in the authenticity and interiority of people besides themselves \u2014 so deeply that they can subordinate their personalities to \u201cpeople\u201d who are merely lines on a script. Acting, Reagan told his biographer Lou Cannon, had taught him \u201cto understand the feelings and motivations of others.\u201d Being a reality star, on the other hand, as Donald Trump was on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d is also a kind of performance, but one that\u2019s antithetical to movie acting. Playing a character on reality TV means being yourself, but bigger and louder. Reality TV, writ broadly, goes back to Allen Funt\u2019s \u201cCandid Camera,\u201d the PBS documentary \u201cAn American Family,\u201d and MTV\u2019s \u201cThe Real World.\u201d But the first mass-market reality TV star was Richard Hatch, the winner of the first season of \u201cSurvivor\u201d \u2014 produced by Mark Burnett, the eventual impresario of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d\u2014 in the summer of 2000. Mr. Hatch won that first season in much the way that Mr. Trump would run his 2016 campaign. He realized that the only rules were that there were no rules. He lied and backstabbed and took advantage of loopholes, and he argued \u2014 with a telegenic brashness \u2014 that this made him smart. This was a crooked game in a crooked world, he argued to a final jury of players he\u2019d betrayed and deceived. But, hey: At least he was open about it! While shooting that first season, the show\u2019s crew was rooting for Rudy Boesch, a 72-year-old former Navy SEAL and model of hard work and fair play. \u201cThe only outcome nobody wanted was Richard Hatch winning,\u201d the host, Jeff Probst, would say later. It \u201cwould be a disaster.\u201d After all, decades of TV cop shows had taught executives the iron rule that the viewers needed the good guy to win. But they didn\u2019t. \u201cSurvivor\u201d was addictively entertaining, and audiences loved-to-hate the wryly devious Richard the way they did Tony Soprano and, before him, J.R. Ewing. More than 50 million people watched the first-season finale, and \u201cSurvivor\u201d has been on the air nearly two decades. From Richard Hatch, we got a steady stream of Real Housewives, Kardashians, nasty judges, dating-show contestants who \u201cdidn\u2019t come here to make friends\u201d and, of course, Donald Trump. Reality TV has often gotten a raw deal from critics. (Full disclosure: I still watch \u201cSurvivor.\u201d) Its audiences, often dismissed as dupes, are just as capable of watching with a critical eye as the fans of prestige cable dramas. But when you apply its mind-set \u2014 the law of the TV jungle \u2014 to public life, things get ugly. In reality TV \u2014 at least competition reality shows like \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d \u2014 you do not attempt to understand other people, except as obstacles or objects. To try to imagine what it is like to be a person other than yourself (what, in ordinary, off-camera life, we call \u201cempathy\u201d) is a liability. It\u2019s a distraction that you have to tune out in order to project your fullest you. Reality TV instead encourages \u201cgetting real.\u201d On MTV\u2019s progressive, diverse \u201cReal World,\u201d the phrase implied that people in the show were more authentic than characters on scripted TV \u2014 or even than real people in your own life, who were socially conditioned to \u201cbe polite.\u201d But \u201cgetting real\u201d would also resonate with a rising conservative notion: that political correctness kept people from saying what was really on their minds. Being real is not the same thing as being honest. To be real is to be the most entertaining, provocative form of yourself. It is to say what you want, without caring whether your words are kind or responsible \u2014 or true \u2014 but only whether you want to say them. It is to foreground the parts of your personality (aggression, cockiness, prejudice) that will focus the red light on you, and unleash them like weapons. Maybe the best definition of being real came from the former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant and White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman in her memoir, \u201cUnhinged.\u201d Mr. Trump, she said, encouraged people in his entourage to \u201cexaggerate the unique part of themselves.\u201d When you\u2019re being real, there is no difference between impulse and strategy, because the \u201cstrategy\u201d is to do what feels good. This is why it misses a key point to ask, as Vanity Fair recently did after Mr. Trump\u2019s assault on Representative Elijah E. Cummings and the city of Baltimore in July, \u201cIs the president a racist, or does he just play one on TV?\u201d In reality TV, if you are a racist \u2014 and reality TV has had many racists, like Katie Hopkins, the far-right British \u201cApprentice\u201d star the president frequently retweets \u2014 then you are a racist and you play one on TV. So if you actually want a glimpse into the mind of Donald J. Trump, don\u2019t look for a White House tell-all or some secret childhood heartbreak. Go to the streaming service Tubi, where his 14 seasons of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d recently became accessible to the public. You can fast-forward past the team challenges and the stagey visits to Trump-branded properties. They\u2019re useful in their own way, as a picture of how Mr. Burnett buttressed the future president\u2019s Potemkin-zillionaire image. But the unadulterated, 200-proof Donald Trump is found in the boardroom segments, at the end of each episode, in which he \u201cfires\u201d one contestant. In theory, the boardroom is where the best performers in the week\u2019s challenges are rewarded and the screw-ups punished. In reality, the boardroom is a new game, the real game, a free-for-all in which contestants compete to throw one another under the bus and beg Mr. Trump for mercy. There is no morality in the boardroom. There is no fair and unfair in the boardroom. There is only the individual, trying to impress Mr. Trump, to flatter Mr. Trump, to commune with his mind and anticipate his whims and fits of pique. Candidates are fired for giving up advantages (stupid), for being too nice to their adversaries (weak), for giving credit to their teammates, for interrupting him. The host\u2019s decisions were often so mercurial, producers have said, that they would have to go back and edit the episodes to impose some appearance of logic on them. What saves you in the boardroom? Fighting. Boardroom Trump loves to see people fight each other. He perks up at it like a cat hearing a can opener. He loves to watch people scrap for his favor (as they eventually would in his White House). He loves asking contestants to rat out their teammates and watching them squirm with conflict. The unity of the team gives way to disunity, which in the Trumpian worldview is the most productive state of being. And America loved boardroom Trump \u2014 for a while. He delivered his catchphrase in TV cameos and slapped it on a reissue of his 1980s Monopoly knockoff Trump: The Game. (\u201cI\u2019m back and you\u2019re fired!\u201d) But after the first season, the ratings dropped; by season four they were nearly half what they were in season one. He reacted to his declining numbers by ratcheting up what worked before: becoming a louder, more extreme, more abrasive version of himself. He gets more insulting in the boardroom \u2014 \u201cYou hang out with losers and you become a loser\u201d\u2014 and executes double and quadruple firings. It\u2019s a pattern that we see as he advances toward his re-election campaign, with an eye not on the Nielsen ratings but on the polls: The only solution for any given problem was a Trumpier Trump. Did it work for \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d? Yes and no. His show hung on to a loyal base through 14 seasons, including the increasingly farcical celebrity version. But it never dominated its competition again, losing out, despite his denials, to the likes of the sitcom \u201cMike & Molly.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cApprentice\u201d boardroom closed for business on Feb. 16, 2015, precisely four months before he announced his successful campaign for president. And also, it never closed. It expanded. It broke the fourth wall. We live inside it now. Now, Mr. Trump re-creates the boardroom\u2019s helter-skelter atmosphere every time he opens his mouth or his Twitter app. In place of the essentially dead White House press briefing, he walks out to the lawn in the morning and reporters gaggle around him like \u201cApprentice\u201d contestants awaiting the day\u2019s task. He rails and complains and establishes the plot points for that day\u2019s episode: Greenland! Jews! \u201cI am the chosen one!\u201d Then cable news spends morning to midnight happily masticating the fresh batch of outrages before memory-wiping itself to prepare for tomorrow\u2019s episode. Maybe this sounds like a TV critic\u2019s overextended metaphor, but it\u2019s also the president\u2019s: As The Times has reported, before taking office, he told aides to think of every day as \u201can episode in a television show in which he vanquishes rivals.\u201d Mr. Trump has been playing himself instinctually as a character since the 1980s; it\u2019s allowed him to maintain a profile even through bankruptcies and humiliations. But it\u2019s also why, on the rare occasions he\u2019s had to publicly attempt a role contrary to his nature \u2014 calling for healing from a script after a mass shooting, for instance \u2014 he sounds as stagey and inauthentic as an unrehearsed amateur doing a sitcom cameo. His character shorthand is \u201cDonald Trump, Fighter Guy Who Wins.\u201d Plop him in front of a camera with an infant orphaned in a mass murder, and he does not have it in his performer\u2019s tool kit to do anything other than smile unnervingly and give a fat thumbs-up. This is what was lost on commentators who kept hoping wanly that this State of the Union or that tragedy would be the moment he finally became \u201cpresidential.\u201d It was lost on journalists who felt obligated to act as though every modulated speech from a teleprompter might, this time, be sincere. The institution of the office is not changing Donald Trump, because he is already in the sway of another institution. He is governed not by the truisms of past politics but by the imperative of reality TV: Never de-escalate and never turn the volume down. This conveniently echoes the mantra he learned from his early mentor, Roy Cohn: Always attack and never apologize. He serves up one \u201cmost shocking episode ever\u201d after another, mining uglier pieces of his core each time: progressing from profanity about Haiti and Africa in private to publicly telling four minority American congresswomen, only one of whom was born outside the United States, to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from. The taunting. The insults. The dog whistles. The dog bullhorns. The \u201cLock her up\u201d and \u201cSend her back.\u201d All of it follows reality-TV rules. Every season has to top the last. Every fight is necessary, be it against Ilhan Omar or Debra Messing. Every twist must be more shocking, every conflict more vicious, lest the red light grow bored and wink off. The only difference: Now there\u2019s no Mark Burnett to impose retroactive logic on the chaos, only press secretaries, pundits and Mike Pence. To ask whether any of this is \u201cinstinct\u201d or \u201cstrategy\u201d is a parlor game. If you think like a TV camera \u2014 if thinking in those reflexive microbursts of adrenaline and testosterone has served you your whole life \u2014 then the instinct is the strategy. And to ask who the \u201creal\u201d Donald Trump is, is to ignore the obvious. You already know who Donald Trump is. All the evidence you need is right there on your screen. He\u2019s half-man, half-TV, with a camera for an eye that is constantly focused on itself. The red light is pulsing, 24/7, and it does not appear to have an off switch.",

He publicly undermined American intelligence agents while standing next to a hostile foreign autocrat. He hired a national security adviser who he knew had secretly worked as a foreign lobbyist. He encourages foreign leaders to enrich him and his family by staying at his hotels. He genuflects to murderous dictators. He has alienated America\u2019s closest allies. He lied to the American people about his company\u2019s business dealings in Russia. He tells new lies virtually every week \u2014 about the economy, voter fraud, even the weather. He spends hours on end watching television and days on end staying at resorts. He often declines to read briefing books or perform other basic functions of a president\u2019s job.

He insulted a Gold Star family \u2014 the survivors of American troops killed in action. He described a former first lady, not long after she died, as \u201cnasty.\u201d He described white supremacists as \u201csome very fine people.\u201d He told four women of color, all citizens and members of Congress, to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came.\u201d He made a joke about Pocahontas during a ceremony honoring Native American World War II veterans. He launched his political career by falsely claiming that the first black president was not really American. He launched his presidential campaign by describing Mexicans as \u201crapists.\u201d He has described women, variously, as \u201ca dog,\u201d \u201ca pig\u201d and \u201chorseface,\u201d as well as \u201cbleeding badly from a facelift\u201d and having \u201cblood coming out of her wherever.\u201d He has been accused of sexual assault or misconduct by multiple women. He enthusiastically campaigned for a Senate candidate who was accused of molesting multiple teenage girls. He waved around his arms, while giving a speech, to ridicule a physically disabled person. He has encouraged his supporters to commit violence against his political opponents. He has called for his opponents and critics to be investigated and jailed. He uses a phrase popular with dictators \u2014 \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d \u2014 to describe journalists. He attempts to undermine any independent source of information that he does not like, including judges, scientists, journalists, election officials, the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the Congressional Budget Office and the National Weather Service.

Shear On the morning of Jan. 11, 2018, Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, received a phone call from the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, summoning him to the White House. Durbin had been working for months with Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, on a deal to grant legal status to the so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 children who had been brought illegally into the country by their parents when they were very young, had grown up here and knew only the United States as home. The news from Trump was encouraging. \u201cWow,\u201d Durbin told an aide. \u201cI think we may actually have a deal.\u201d Durbin and Graham \u2014 who received a similar call that morning \u2014 expected a private meeting with the president, but as they waited in the West Wing lobby a phalanx of hard-liners arrived, led by Stephen Miller, the young mastermind of Trump\u2019s draconian immigration policies. Were they being ambushed? Durbin wondered. Indeed, they were. The meeting lapsed into a notorious Trump rant \u2014 about accepting immigrants from \u201cshithole countries.\u201d The president seemed amazed by the Durbin-Graham proposal: \u201cWait a minute \u2014 why do we want people from Haiti here?\u201d Why not more people from Norway? Graham was flabbergasted: What had happened between 10 a.m., when the president called offering the deal, and noon, when the historic Oval Office tirade had taken place? \u201cI don\u2019t know where that guy\u201d \u2014 the more amenable Trump \u2014 \u201cwent,\u201d Graham told the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen days later. \u201cI want him back.\u201d Trump\u2019s bigoted eruption was instant news. But the context provided by the New York Times journalists Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D. Shear in their exquisitely reported \u201cBorder Wars\u201d reveals the shattering horror of the moment, the mercurial unreliability and instability of the president. Davis and Shear perform this contextual service time and again throughout their book, which is essential reading for those searching for the \u201cbeating heart\u201d of the Trump administration. The authors argue it is immigration policy, and who can dispute that? From his very first news conference as a presidential candidate, when he denounced Mexican border-crossers as rapists and criminals, a rancid nativism \u2014 aimed at people who have darker skins than Norwegians \u2014 has been Trump\u2019s tribalist weapon of choice, his scalpel prodding the worst impulses of the American spirit. Nativism isn\u2019t as American as apple pie \u2014 indeed, it is the very opposite of our country\u2019s heterogeneous intention \u2014 but it has been with us since the Irish began arriving in droves in the mid-19th century. It has almost always been a minor chord in American politics, but it has flared from time to time \u2014 with the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, the harsh restrictions on southern and eastern Europeans in 1924, and again today, 50 years after Lyndon Johnson liberalized immigration policy in 1965. Davis and Shear are scrupulously fair reporters. They give Trump\u2019s minions a respectful hearing. The current immigration system is, indeed, a mess. The Dreamers are, technically, here illegally, as are many others who overstay their visas or apply for refugee status and simply disappear into the population. There are reasonable reforms on offer, like favoring immigrants with skills over the current system based on family ties (\u201cchain migration\u201d), non-nativist reforms that countries like Canada and Australia have adopted. But the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cremedies\u201d have been flagrantly \u2014 and purposefully \u2014 punitive. The astonishing policy of separating children from their parents at the border was imposed as a deterrent: An experiment at the El Paso portal showed that illegal crossing declined 64 percent when word got out that children would be taken from their parents at the border. Stephen Miller took it national. An internal Department of Homeland Security memo noted \u201charm to children is being deliberately used for its deterrent effect.\u201d Davis and Shear are at their best describing the chaotic inner processes of the administration. They are less successful when they attempt to describe the effects of the crackdown on actual human beings \u2014 or give insight into the perpetrators of the Trump policies. They wait 280 pages to offer a biographical sketch of Miller, which raises more questions than it answers. He is the descendant of Jewish refugees, it turns out. His family owns a chain of grocery stores. He grew up in ultra-blue Santa Monica, Calif., but distinguished himself from the crowd as a right-wing provocateur in high school. He rose through congressional staff ranks and became a top aide to the immigrant-phobic Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. His co-workers think he\u2019s a nice guy. But his policies \u2014 and his pursuit of them \u2014 are stunningly heartless. We need to know more about him. In this account, Trump is as he ever was: craven, feckless, moody, narcissistic, mendacious, forgetful. He is sympathetic to the Dreamers he meets in private, but is willing to place their lives and futures in jeopardy to feed the passions of his supporters. He is addicted to inflaming the basest instincts of his base. And it is all a show. \u201cThis is why people loved me on \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019\u201d Trump told House Speaker Paul Ryan, after bragging about nonexistent \u201cratings\u201d for yet another ballistic meeting in the Oval Office. There is no distinction between reality and reality TV for this president. In 2016, it was a distinction that escaped the American public as well. Davis and Shear are right: Immigration demagogy is at the \u201cheart\u201d of the Trump show \u2014 and the Trump show is at the heart of our tragic decline as a civil and humane society.",

      "content": " Most people, perhaps even most sociopaths, have an internal alarm that goes off when they do something wrong. They may not feel an ounce of guilt, remorse or sorrow, but their instinct for survival is strong enough to send a red alert. Not so with President Trump. The first question I had after reading the White House reconstruction of the July 25 phone call, in which he prods Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to interfere with an American election, was: How could they release this? \u201cIt turned out to be a nothing call,\u201d Trump said. He also described it as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cperfect\u201d and asked for an apology from his critics. This was a \u201cnothing call\u201d only to a man with nothing for a moral foundation. This was exculpatory only to someone who thinks that the crime he has just outlined for all the world to see does not matter. This was \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cperfect\u201d only to someone who has crossed so many lines in his life that he has no idea where the boundaries are. The whistle-blower\u2019s complaint, released on Thursday, at least shows that some people in the White House knew what a violation of the oath of office looked like \u2014 and were frantic to cover it up. The whistle-blower described an attempt to \u201clock down\u201d evidence of Trump\u2019s betrayal of his country. But the politically perilous road to impeachment will start and end with the words of a morally bankrupt man who has spent his entire adult life skirting, mocking, ignoring or breaking the law. The case against him is in plain sight. Trump himself is the smoking gun, as Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Washington State Democrat, said. In his own best-case version, the White House memo of the phone call, he asks a foreign leader to investigate one of his chief political rivals while Trump is holding up nearly $400 million in aid to that leader\u2019s beleaguered country. Trump sees this as no big deal because he\u2019s always gotten away with his many transgressions, floating above the law in a padded world of privilege and prevarication. From trying to prevent black tenants from renting the apartments owned by his family, to his stiffing of contractors, cabinetmakers, drivers and others who worked for him, to defrauding students at a phony university, Trump\u2019s life is a biography of scam and scofflaw. His view is not unlike that of Richard Nixon, who famously said, \u201cWhen the president does it, that means it\u2019s not illegal.\u201d Except in Trump\u2019s case, it refers to himself, not just the high office he holds. For him, it\u2019s a life motto. And one more thing about Nixon: The Trickster at least knew enough about violating his oath to fight the release of his own smoking gun, the tapes that implicated him in a cover-up and doomed his presidency. Trump did not develop a late-life conscience, once he became leader of the free world. Neo-Nazis are very fine people, he said. The Nobel Peace Prize is rigged. The weather is what he says it is. As soon as he felt he could get away with his attempt to obstruct an investigation into Russian meddling \u2014 the day after Robert S. Mueller III testified to Congress \u2014 Trump urged Ukraine to meddle in an American election. This is not disputed, not by the words released from Trump\u2019s own White House. The Democrats were left with no choice. Even if it costs them the presidency, they can no longer be blind to their constitutional responsibility. This could be one of those cases where the right thing to do by the country is not the best thing to do politically. The call to duty was made most powerfully in an op-ed essay in The Washington Post by seven Democrats from swing districts. All of them had military or national security experience and had previously been against impeachment. All are freshmen, and vulnerable to losing their seats. \u201cThese allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect,\u201d they wrote. Let them be the face of the Democratic Party during impeachment. And let the Republican-run Senate, a graveyard of principle, be stuck with defending a lawless president. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d Such was the plaintive cry of John Kasich, a Republican who found a spine and lost his party. \u201cAre you hiding under a rock?\u201d Actually, they are in plain sight, just like the evidence of Trump\u2019s high crimes and misdemeanors. People should stop waiting for the Big Reveal to jolt Republicans out of their co-conspiracy with a corrupt president. The Big Reveal has happened. Republicans are all in with Trump. It\u2019s trickle-up politics: the base is debased, backed by right-wing media. \u201cTo impeach any president over a phone call like this would be insane,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham. In years to come Graham will be remembered, if at all, as an invertebrate politician who cowered before someone he once called a \u201ckook\u201d and \u201cunfit for office.\u201d But those who are \u201cmoved by the spirit or history to take action to protect and preserve the integrity of our nation,\u201d as Representative John Lewis said, will not be forgotten. They realize that the Constitution can\u2019t save itself.",

      "author": "Ross Douthat",
      "content": " When it comes to determining when it makes sense to impeach a president, congressional Democrats are working with 200 words in the Constitution, three significant historical precedents, the fervor of impeachment advocates, the anxieties of swing-state members of Congress and all the polling data that a modern political party can buy. None of this, unfortunately, tells them what to do when the president in question actually wants them to impeach him. That Donald Trump actually wants to be impeached is an argument that Ben Domenech, the publisher of The Federalist, has been making for some time \u2014 that the president isn\u2019t stumbling backward toward impeachment, but is actually eager for the fight. In his email newsletter Monday morning, Domenech cited the last few days of Ukraine-related agitation as vindication, arguing that the circus atmosphere of congressional hearings, scenes of Joe Biden talking about corruption instead of health care or the economy, and wavering House Democrats getting forced into an impeachment vote by their angry colleagues and constituents are all exactly what Trump wants. [Agree to disagree, or disagree better? Sign up for our new newsletter, Debatable, to understand the sharpest arguments on the most pressing issues of the week, from new and familiar voices.] For my own part I think wants is probably an overstatement, since it implies a strategic purpose, a permanent intention and a stable mental state, none of which should be assumed when analyzing the president of the United States. But let\u2019s go this far with Domenech: A president who escapes unscathed from an investigation into his campaign\u2019s collusion with a foreign government and then the day after Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony is on the phone jawboning a foreign government to help out his presidential campaign \u2014 does that president seem like a man who\u2019s particularly worried about being impeached? Who\u2019s terribly concerned with avoiding having articles filed, a Senate trial, the works? I would say \u2026 not. And why might Trump be so unconcerned? Maybe, as impeachment advocates insist, he just thinks Democrats are too gutless to defend the Constitution, too weak to oppose his lawlessness. But it\u2019s also possible (and yes, now I\u2019m going to assume his rationality, having just warned against that, sorry) that he might see four upsides to impeachment, four gifts to his presidency and perhaps his post-presidency that an impeachment and a trial might bring. First, if the Democrats impeach him they will be doing something unpopular instead of something popular. Maybe the polls showing impeachment\u2019s unpopularity will alter as the Ukraine story develops. Maybe public hearings will deliver a series of blows that persuades the large anti-Trump, anti-impeachment constituency that his expedited removal from office is desirable or necessary. But the current shape of public opinion is the boring, basic reason that Trump seems to want to be impeached more than Nancy Pelosi wants to impeach him: The Democratic agenda is more popular than the Republican agenda (whatever that is), the likely Democratic nominees are all more popular than Trump, and so anything that puts the Democrats on the wrong side of public opinion may look better, through Trump\u2019s eyes, than the status quo. Second, Trump is happy to pit his overt abuses of power against the soft corruption of his foes. This is an aspect of Trumpism that the president\u2019s critics find particularly infuriating \u2014 the way he attacks his rivals for being corrupt swamp creatures while being so much more nakedly compromised himself. But whether the subject is the Clinton Foundation\u2019s influence-peddling or now the Biden family\u2019s variation on that theme, Trump has always sold himself as the candidate of a more honest form of graft \u2014 presenting his open cynicism as preferable to carefully legal self-dealing, exquisitely laundered self-enrichment, the spirit of \u201chey, it\u2019s totally normal for the vice president\u2019s son to get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by the Ukrainians or the Chinese so long as every disclosure form gets filled out and his dad doesn\u2019t talk to him about the business.\u201d In fact this sort of elite seaminess is bad, but what Trump offers isn\u2019t preferable: Hypocrisy is better than naked vice, soft corruption is better than the more open sort, and what the president appears to have done in leaning on the Ukrainian government is much worse than Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas arrangements. But no one should be surprised that some voters in our age of mistrust and fragmentation and despair prefer the honest graft \u2014 some in Trump\u2019s base, and also some in the ranks of the alienated and aggrieved middle, the peculiar Obama-Trump constituency. Indeed, history is replete with \u201cboss\u201d-style politicians who got away with corruption because they were seen as the rough, effective alternative to a smug, hypocritical elite. Trump\u2019s crucial political weakness is that unlike those bosses, he hasn\u2019t delivered that much to many of his voters. But that may make him all the more eager to return to the politics of comparative corruption, to have the argument again about whether he\u2019s more ethically challenged than the swamp. He may not win it, but at least he\u2019s playing a part that he knows well. Third, an impeachment battle would give Trump a last chance to solidify his hold on the souls and reputations of his possible Republican successors. To understand what I mean, consider Jonathan V. Last\u2019s explanation of why so few Republican elected officials are likely to break with Trump, no matter how Nixonian his straits become: This doesn\u2019t just explain why Trump thinks he can survive an impeachment fight; it also explains why he might relish it. He knows that he could well lose the next election, but there\u2019s no reason a mere general-election defeat will prevent him from wielding power over the Republican Party, via Twitter and other means, for many years to come. And what better way to consolidate that power (or at least the feeling of that power) in the last year of his administration than seeing all his would-be successors, all the bright younger men of the Senate especially, come down and kiss the ring one last time? Come on down, Marco Rubio! Step right up, Ben Sasse! Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz, the history books are watching: Tell us one more time, just one more time, how completely Donald Trump the Great owns your vote, your principles, your honor! Which brings us to the last reason Trump might kind of like to be impeached: Because the circus is the part of politics that he fundamentally enjoys. Throughout the Mueller investigation my Twitter feed was alight with liberal and NeverTrump fantasies about how Trump must be bed-wetting, flop-sweat terrified by the tough G-man\u2019s investigation. And maybe at times he was. But I\u2019m pretty sure that when he ranted on Twitter about the \u201cTwelve Angry Democrats\u201d and \u201cWITCH HUNT\u201d and \u201cNO COLLUSION,\u201d he was more engaged, more alive, more fully his full self than at any point during the legislative battles over tax reform or Obamacare repeal. And Robert Mueller\u2019s was a legal investigation, with the power to actually put people in Trump\u2019s inner circle in prison. A merely political trial, where the worst-case scenario is a political martyrdom that Sean Hannity will sing of ever after, seems to offer Trump a much lower-stress variation on that experience. Why, the nicknames for the impeachment managers alone will be a Trumpian banquet, a veritable feast! [Listen to \u201cThe Argument\u201d podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] None of this, I should stress, adds up to an airtight argument that the Democrats should not impeach. Nine months ago I made a case against impeachment, and many of the arguments in that essay might apply to this case \u2014 depending on how far it turns out Trump went in pressuring Ukraine. But politics is a contact sport, a field for combat as well as for maneuver, and just because someone wants a fight doesn\u2019t mean that you should never, ever give him one. The dictum about wrestling a pig (you get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it) doesn\u2019t hold up if the pig keeps punching you; the dictum that it\u2019s better to beat Trump at the polls than lose a Senate vote probably doesn\u2019t hold up if you talk yourself into looking permanently supine in the face of indubitable corruption. Much of the Trump era has consisted of politicians of both parties waiting for someone else to give Trump a knockout blow. So there\u2019s something to be said, at the level of spiritedness if not necessarily strategy, for House Democrats to take a swing themselves. But my ultimate guess is that none of this matters quite as much as some impeachment arguers suppose. An impeachment effort could be both foredoomed and unlikely to influence the 2020 outcome all that much, so Nancy Pelosi might be wise to forestall one but also find herself with few regrets if one gets forced on her. The nature of the Trump era is that yuge events recede far more rapidly than anyone expects. So it might be with impeachment: Have the vote or don\u2019t have it, we\u2019ll be arguing about something completely different by the time Americans are going to the polls.",

      "content": " American diplomats thought they had negotiated a solution to a seemingly intractable problem. The United States needed Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria to face off against remnants of the Islamic State. But Turkey, a NATO ally, saw those same Kurds as terrorists, allied with separatists inside Turkey. To prevent a Turkish invasion, the three sides \u2014 the United States, Turkey and the Kurds \u2014 agreed to five-mile-wide safe zones along the border with Turkey, in Syria. Americans would patrol alongside Turkish forces, and the Kurds would dismantle fortifications in those areas that were designed to defend against a possible Turkish incursion. Turkey would also join American-led air operations against Islamic State militants. The deal would put a strain on the 1,000 or so American troops stationed in the region, but it would protect the Kurds in northern Syria and maintain pressure on the Islamic State. President Trump let all that be destroyed when, succumbing to pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, the White House announced that Mr. Trump would not stand in the way of a Turkish invasion to expel Kurdish forces from the border region. The language of the announcement made it seem as if he was even endorsing the move. Even if the Turks do not invade \u2014 and while the president\u2019s tweets on Monday indicated he might be rethinking his green light to the Turks, there were reports that attacks had already begun \u2014 the decision may destroy any trust the Kurds, America\u2019s crucial partner in Syria, had left. It could also threaten the fight against ISIS. Mr. Trump appears once again to have acted impulsively, in this case after a phone call with Mr. Erdogan. He blindsided officials at the Pentagon and the State Department and kept Congress and the allies in the dark. Administration national security officials have argued forcefully for maintaining a small troop presence in northeast Syria to continue pursuing the Islamic State and as a counterweight to Turkey and Syria\u2019s Russian and Iranian allies. Mr. Trump\u2019s determination to withdraw those remaining troops led to the resignations of former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the special envoy to the coalition fighting ISIS, Brett McGurk, last December. Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement and tweets infuriated conservative allies, including the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and Senator Lindsey Graham. \u201cThe Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria,\u201d tweeted Nikki Haley, Mr. Trump\u2019s first ambassador to the United Nations. \u201cLeaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend.\u201d By midday Monday, the Pentagon was trying to contain the damage by announcing that it and the president had made clear to Turkey \u201cthat we do not endorse a Turkish operation in northern Syria.\u201d The statement added that American military forces \u201cwill not support or be involved in any such operation.\u201d The president himself expressed second thoughts, which were, in their own way, even more jarring. \u201cAs I have stated strongly before,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cand just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!).\u201d Just what, in his unmatched wisdom, Mr. Trump meant by \u201coff limits,\u201d or economic destruction, or the rest of the tweet was not clear. Nor is this the first time the Trump administration has sent conflicting messages about American objectives in Syria. Last December, Mr. Trump overruled his top advisers to order the withdrawal of all 2,000 American ground troops from Syria within 30 days. The decision was ultimately reversed, but it was the final straw for Mr. Mattis. Mr. Erdogan has long threatened to send troops into Syria. Since losing an important election in Istanbul in March, he has been under increasing pressure to find ways to shore up his domestic political support. He\u2019d also like to resettle at least one million Syrian refugees now living in Turkey within the safe zone on the Syrian side of the border. Those refugees have become a political liability for him. But if Kurds in Syria have to defend themselves against the Turks, they are likely to shift their forces from the fight against ISIS, including the guarding of about 10,000 ISIS prisoners now in Kurdish detention centers. Making it possible for refugees to return home is a worthy goal, but forced resettlement is rarely successful. Moreover, many refugees in Turkey do not come from northern Syria and are unlikely to mix easily with local populations. Whether Turkey will go forward with a full invasion is unclear. On Mr. Trump\u2019s orders, a couple hundred American troops have been removed from two military outposts. At the same time, the Kurds have stopped dismantling their fortifications and the joint American-Turkish patrols have been ended, officials say. Congress is threatening sanctions on Turkey. It may seem paradoxical, but in caving in to one of the strongmen he so admires, Mr. Trump may have set the United States on a collision course with Turkey. He\u2019s also put himself into conflict with the Pentagon and his own Republican allies. He may walk his own decision back once again, in part or in whole. But what ally could look at the United States now and see a stalwart partner \u2014 and what foe could look at it and fear a determined adversary?",

      "content": " WHO IS AN EVANGELICAL?\nThe History of a Movement in Crisis\nBy Thomas S. Kidd\nTHE IMMORAL MAJORITY\nWhy Evangelicals Chose Political Power Over Christian Values\nBy Ben Howe How 81 percent of evangelicals could have voted for Donald Trump, given his flouting of their \u201ctraditional values,\u201d has been a question for many Americans since 2016. Thomas S. Kidd and Ben Howe, both evangelicals, try to answer this question in different ways. Kidd, a professor of history at Baylor University, finds an explanation in the history of the relationship between evangelicals and political power. It was, he tells us, \u201ca myth\u201d that the Puritans favored religious freedom for all. Rather, they wanted the freedom to practice their own religion and brought a relatively harsh form of religious establishment to Massachusetts and Connecticut. It was the evangelicals in the Great Awakenings \u2014 the religious revivals in the 18th and 19th centuries \u2014 who spread the idea of religious liberty John Locke inspired in them. After the Revolution, evangelicals, mainly Baptists and Methodists, adopted the principle of separation of church and state and helped James Madison and Thomas Jefferson enshrine it in the first amendment to the Constitution. Nevertheless, Kidd writes, when evangelicals gained ascendancy, they sometimes pursued cultural and legal power that the purists of the founding generation would have disdained. For example, some leading evangelicals in the antebellum period banned the Sunday mail in their communities. And often, as in the case of slavery, the temptation to bring their moral convictions into the public square was irresistible. Northern evangelicals argued that slavery was against God\u2019s will, while Southerners cited biblical passages to prove the opposite. \u201cAs a general rule,\u201d Kidd writes, \u201cevangelicals have been at their best when using their political sway to defend the weak and oppressed (such as slaves), rather than seeking to impose evangelical practices, ideas or standards of conscience on the public.\u201d By the time of the Civil War, evangelical churches were so dominant, Kidd writes, that they represented a de facto establishment. But the issue of slavery tore the Northern and Southern churches apart, and divided black from white churches. Kidd tells us evangelicals would never again reach the same level of cohesion that they did before the 1840s. Still, white evangelicals remained the de facto establishment in both the North and South, making laws on such things as prayer in the public schools. In fact, the first real split in evangelicalism came in the Northern churches at the end of the century over the issues of theology and Darwinian evolution. Kidd describes the doctrinal splits, but says, \u201cPromoting anti-evolution laws was one of the most misguided evangelical ventures ever,\u201d and the Scopes trial of 1925 \u201cillustrated the temptations of media access, establishment politics and celebrity politicians in evangelical history.\u201d The trial, he writes, \u201cwas a major precedent for the crisis of politicization that bedevils evangelical Christianity today.\u201d Interestingly, Kidd traces what he calls the crisis of the movement to the 1940s, when Billy Graham and many other preachers blended their gospel with anti-Communism. The turning point, he says, came when Graham made an alliance with President Eisenhower, and evangelicals began to conflate pollical power and access to Republican leaders with the advancement of God\u2019s kingdom. Kidd describes the Republican efforts to woo evangelicals while President Johnson\u2019s civil rights acts were turning white Southerners against him. Throughout the book, Kidd does a good job of including the perspectives of black clergymen. However, he, like many other evangelicals, often equates \u201cevangelicals\u201d with \u201cChristians,\u201d and negates the role Northern white Catholics and mainline Protestants played in the civil rights movement. He continues his historical narrative through the rise of the Christian right (or what he calls \u201cRepublican insider evangelicals\u201d), plus the \u201cconservative resurgence\u201d in the Southern Baptist Convention. Only in his last pages does he get to the election of Donald Trump, and after all he has said about the corrupting effects of political power on a religious community, the coda is disappointing. He recites the familiar excuses: Evangelicals voted against Hillary Clinton rather than for Donald Trump; among Christians in politics, the media care only about evangelicals; polling doesn\u2019t differentiate between nominal evangelicals and those who hold to traditional beliefs, etc. He admits that evangelical fealty to the Republican Party is real and has done considerable damage to the movement, but he insists that evangelicals should not be defined by the 81 percent because being a real evangelical entails conversion, devotion to an infallible Bible and to God\u2019s discernible presence on earth. But since polls show that evangelicals who attended church frequently voted for Trump at much the same rate as nominal evangelicals, he is left with no explanation for why so many evangelicals voted for an adulterer who boasts about his sexual conquests. Ben Howe is not the scholar Kidd is, but his book comes closer to an explanation; for, unlike Kidd, Howe was a conservative activist who went through a change of heart during the 2016 primaries. A writer, podcaster and filmmaker, he grew up in what he describes as an \u201cideal\u201d evangelical family. As the family moved about, he went to W. A. Criswell\u2019s church in Dallas and later to Jerry Falwell Sr.\u2019s church in Lynchburg, Va. The two pastors were fundamentalists, heavily involved with politics and, as a boy, Howe supported the Moral Majority. Later, he had great hopes when George W. Bush was elected. He liked the idea of \u201ccompassionate conservatism,\u201d and he also liked the president\u2019s \u201cmoral clarity\u201d when, after 9/11, he told America\u2019s allies that they had to be either for the United States or for the terrorists. Many evangelicals, Howe writes, had come to believe that the cultural tide was shifting, putting the idea of a Christian nation at the forefront of popular conservative thinking. According to Howe, when Obama was elected, evangelicals became subjected \u201cto what they saw as years of slander.\u201d They had been \u201cinsulted and defiled \u2026 mocked and marginalized for their beliefs.\u201d Even in the years before Obama, \u201cevery action President Bush took was met with hysterical mania by the left, which painted him as everything from a racist to a Nazi.\u201d Howe was outraged. On Obama\u2019s Inauguration Day he wrote an article for the website RedState entitled \u201cMy Conservative Pledge,\u201d in which he complained about having seen \u201chatred, loathing, anger, ignorance, violence, suppression, oppression, blacklisting \u2026 my integrity impugned \u2026 my God spit upon.\u201d Howe apparently discovered all of this while surfing the underground streams of the internet, where trolls battle in the darkness. In any case, he says, the conservative reaction during the Obama administration was to hit back twice as hard. In his view, long before Trump appeared on the scene, a \u201ctoxic mixture of resentment and desire for revenge \u2026 spawned the Trump evangelical movement.\u201d Trump then successfully courted evangelicals by promising to give them power and to fight back on their behalf. Today Howe says that Trump did get things done for evangelicals, like nominating justices opposed to abortion, but he sees in the president \u201cuntold chasms of depravity.\u201d And he accuses Trump of pulling many evangelicals into \u201ca vortex of moral ambiguity and relativism,\u201d surrendering their moral voice in the public sphere for a bit of worldly influence.",

      "content": " The news cycle has already blown past it, but I think we should dwell a little more on that time, just a few days ago, when President Trump declared himself above the Constitution. No, the president did not say, \u201cI am above the Constitution.\u201d But that was the gist of the eight-page letter sent on his behalf to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Democratic majority, not just contesting the impeachment inquiry but challenging the very idea of presidential accountability. [Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing, culture and ideas from around the internet. For exclusive thoughts, photos and reading recommendations, sign up for his newsletter.] With that letter, Trump all but announced his monarchal pretensions \u2014 that he is the presidency and the presidency is him. And while there are other, juicier stories to follow in this impeachment saga \u2014 just yesterday, two associates of Rudy Giuliani were arrested and charged with federal crimes \u2014 this event is significant for what it underscores about the moment. In short, we are living through a bona fide constitutional crisis. \u201cPresident Trump and his Administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process,\u201d reads the letter from Pat Cipollone, who serves as counsel to the president. Cipollone also accuses House Democrats of violating the due process rights of the president and insists that impeachment is invalid if it isn\u2019t begun by an official resolution. He continues: \u201cYour transparent rush to judgment, lack of democratically accountable authorization, and violation of basic rights in the current proceedings make clear the illegitimate, partisan purpose of this purported \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019. \u201d It\u2019s all a little dramatic. Cipollone goes on: Most of this is nonsense. The Constitution only specifies the basics of impeachment: The House initiates it and the Senate votes on it. Everything else is left to the respective chambers. No particular process is required. The House is fully empowered to collect evidence, take testimony and subpoena witnesses without passing a resolution to announce it is considering impeachment. The House acts as a kind of grand jury \u2014 where the \u201cArticles of Impeachment\u201d correspond to the counts in an indictment \u2014 with no obligation to take witnesses from the defense. That will come later, if the House impeaches and the Senate holds a trial. In addition to its nakedly partisan claims, the White House is also making its case with constitutional language, but there is no constitutional support for its arguments. But we shouldn\u2019t get bogged down in the particulars of the letter or its tenuous relationship to the facts. The problem with the White House response is not that it\u2019s wrong, but that it\u2019s an assertion of unaccountable power. To call impeachment \u201cillegitimate\u201d and reject Congress\u2019s ability to conduct oversight is to put forth a doctrine of presidential infallibility, an extreme form of Richard Nixon\u2019s quip that \u201cwhen the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\u201d To refuse cooperation and compliance is to challenge the constitutional prerogative of a coequal branch of government. The framers understood that re-election wasn\u2019t enough to compel good behavior from the chief executive. As James Madison argued during the constitutional convention of 1787, impeachment exists as a safeguard against the \u201cincapacity, negligence or perfidy of the chief magistrate.\u201d But Trump, speaking through Cipollone, rejects this. To this White House, elections are the only acceptable form of accountability. \u201cThe decision as to who will be elected President in 2020 should rest with the people of the United States, exactly where the Constitution places it.\u201d What\u2019s worse is that, according to a longstanding opinion from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, a president cannot be indicted while still in office. If impeachment is illegitimate and Trump intends to defy all congressional subpoenas and investigation, then he\u2019s suddenly untethered the office from the entire constitutional system. He becomes what the framers feared \u2014 an elected king, answerable only to his supporters. (Here it\u2019s worth noting the hypocrisy of relying on the Constitution when it justifies his own power \u2014 Trump is only president because of the Electoral College \u2014 and rejecting it when that power is challenged.) Within weeks of Trump\u2019s taking office, scholars and observers wondered if he would precipitate a constitutional crisis. The verdict was uncertain. Yes, he attacked judges, urged officials to ignore court orders and claimed vast powers for his administration. But when challenged by the courts, or the Republican-held Congress, he backed down. Now, he faces a hostile majority. And that changes the dynamic. Political ruin is on the horizon and Trump \u2014 with his clear taste for autocrats and autocracy \u2014 will undermine American democracy if that will keep it at bay. I say this as if it\u2019s a surprise, but of course it\u2019s not. Trump is an authoritarian by instinct, with little respect for our democratic traditions, much less the Constitution. Of course he\u2019d flout Congress\u2019s authority and trash the separation of powers to protect himself from accountability. It\u2019s the most predictable choice he could make. As long as Republicans continue to stick with the president, the only question now is how Democrats respond. Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate or comply is itself an impeachable offense, one more transgression to add to any articles drafted by the House. But there\u2019s still the immediate problem of meeting White House escalation head on. Democrats can do this by using all the authority they have at their disposal. The House can impeach officials, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who participate in the president\u2019s obstruction. It can even hold uncooperative officials in contempt and detain them for rejecting subpoenas. The Constitution cannot enforce itself. The only way to stop an attack on separation of powers is to push back with equal force. The president and his allies think they can reject congressional oversight. It\u2019s up to Democrats to bring the fight into public view and force the Trump camp to see that it is Congress that has the authority in this conflict. Trump may want it to be one way, but for the sake of the Constitution, he needs to understand that it\u2019s the other way.",

      "content": " There\u2019s no way that Mike Pompeo actually venerates Donald Trump. I doubt he even likes the president much. Pompeo graduated first in his class at West Point decades ago, a feat that suggests enormous reserves of discipline, a profound respect for tradition and a talent for self-effacement when the circumstances warrant it. Trump possesses none of those qualities. Pompeo is an evangelical Christian, steeped in the very dictums that Trump has spent a lifetime mocking with both his words and his deeds. And Pompeo has long believed in the importance of American military intervention abroad, the kind of activist role that Trump railed against during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. In fact Pompeo, who was then a congressman from Kansas, supported Marco Rubio \u2014 and publicly praised him, while disparaging Trump, just before the state\u2019s Republican caucus in March 2016. As Susan Glasser of The New Yorker recalled in an excellent recent profile of Pompeo, he sounded an alarm that Trump would be \u201can authoritarian president who ignored our Constitution.\u201d He urged Republicans to come to their senses and resist the lure of the surging Trump campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he said, \u201cto turn down the lights on the circus.\u201d But the lights continued to burn bright, so Pompeo just put on a clown suit, put away his ethics and finagled a big role under the Big Top. He had plenty of company in that transformation. It\u2019s the wonder of the Trump era and one of the saddest, scariest themes of the impeachment inquiry so far: the teeming crowd of sellouts and suck-ups who eagerly traded principle for position and are in some cases doubling and tripling down on that transaction, to a point where it\u2019s fair to ask if there was ever much principle to begin with. [Get a more personal take on politics, newsmakers and more with Frank Bruni\u2019s exclusive commentary every week. Sign up for his newsletter.] I\u2019m looking at you, Lindsey Graham, who somehow decided that Trump was the new John McCain, which is like deeming tripe the new tenderloin. Hell, I\u2019m looking at most of the Republicans in the Senate. I\u2019m not so much looking at Attorney General William Barr, odious as his behavior has been, because it\u2019s clear in retrospect that he never made much of a pretense of rectitude, at least not in the context of Trump. He also wasn\u2019t on record trashing Trump, not the way Pompeo and Graham and so many others who now dutifully echo him and gaze beatifically at him were. They must have broken necks from their moral whiplash. Barr\u2019s neck supports that big head of his just fine. Pompeo, who first signed on as Trump\u2019s C.I.A. director and then flattered his way to secretary of state, is a paragon of these lackeys-come-lately, and he\u2019s especially vivid proof of how easily and completely the lure of power can overwhelm any call to conscience. He raised his hand for secretary of state after he\u2019d seen his predecessor, Rex Tillerson, humiliated by Trump and fired by tweet. This was more than a year into Trump\u2019s presidency, by which point the rationalizations of other supposedly serious conservatives who took top administration jobs no longer held water. It was clear that Trump wasn\u2019t just a few artful nudges away from proper presidential bearing. He couldn\u2019t be lifted up because he was too busy cruelly dragging everyone else down. But Pompeo had a heady shot at a vaunted job that almost surely wasn\u2019t going to come his way any other time. So he lunged for it, then demonstrated with his obsequiousness that doing good and doing right were never high on the agenda. He wrote an op-ed article that essentially broke with his fellow Republicans to promote Trump\u2019s view that Saudi Arabia\u2019s butchery of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi shouldn\u2019t give anyone pause. What are a few severed body parts among allies? He recalled the ambassador to Ukraine just to please the president and his babbling Beelzebub, Rudy Giuliani. He listened mutely to that July 25 phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, decided to ignore what he heard and then claimed \u2014 until a few days ago \u2014 that he was utterly in the dark about any pressure on Ukraine to kneecap Joe Biden. In Greece on Saturday, he proudly portrayed the Trump administration\u2019s approach to Ukraine as a high-minded vigil against corruption and an attempt to ensure against interference in American elections. In the process he gave fresh currency to a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 presidential race. Had he spoken up about the phone call or pushed back, he would have risked ending up on the outside, among the swelling Trump administration diaspora. He preferred the inside, with its glossier trappings and cushier thrones. He and his wife were diplomatic royalty, jetting around the world. He could bear the ache of a tongue full of tooth marks. Better to be a wretched part of history than no part at all. The tale sounds familiar because it is. It\u2019s the story of Faust, who sold his soul for renown, then endured the ugliness of that deal. It\u2019s also the story of too many of Trump\u2019s Republican enablers to count. Sure, they decided to prop and pretty him up, a man whose unfitness for the Oval Office was never really in doubt, out of tribal loyalty, a force far too potent in American politics today. But some rushed to him because that\u2019s where the riches were, at least metaphorically. That\u2019s where the fame was. And they weren\u2019t simply burying the hatchet with a politician who hadn\u2019t been their preferred candidate or whose positions differed from theirs only slightly. They were dismantling the chain saw that they\u2019d wielded in the face of a fraud whose conduct, along with some of his proposals, was antithetical to who they claimed to be. Few people remember anymore, but just years before she became the dark empress of \u201calternative facts,\u201d Kellyanne Conway was a respected, reasonably mainstream, uncontroversial Republican pollster and strategist. Just months before she joined Team Trump, she correctly labeled him \u201cvulgar,\u201d said that he wasn\u2019t presidential, called him a liar and demanded his tax returns. Then he offered her the lofty job of managing his presidential campaign \u2014 and all the television airtime that came with it \u2014 and she turned herself into a kowtowing cartoon. She\u2019ll never be seen the same way again. Was the ride really worth it? And what was Mick Mulvaney thinking when he agreed to be Trump\u2019s third chief of staff, having witnessed the tortures of chiefs Nos. 1 and 2? Before Trump was elected, Mulvaney called him and Hillary Clinton \u201ctwo of the most flawed human beings running for president in the history of the country,\u201d and lest you think Trump was merely collateral damage in her disparagement, Mulvaney separately called Trump \u201ca terrible human being.\u201d Now he calls him boss. Amazing how revulsion crumbles when relevance is in the equation. Graham was oddly and briefly honest about this in an interview with The Times\u2019s Mark Leibovich, framing his kinship with Trump, whom he once called \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest jackass,\u201d as part of his career-long quest \u201cto try to be relevant.\u201d This quest now involves the insistence that Trump, rather than abusing the presidency to dig up imagined dirt on a political rival, is the victim of some setup. You can hear Graham\u2019s version as predictably loopy illogic from a senator up for re-election next year in the deep-red state of South Carolina, but it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s the fee for being able to get the president on the phone, for being invited to play golf with him, for feeling the rush of access, for crowing about your perch at the epicenter of the action. He and Pompeo will have insider anecdotes to last the rest of their lives. They\u2019ll need just as long to convince themselves that they didn\u2019t overpay.

      "content": " Nations of the world, take heed. There was a time, just months ago even, when a foreign country interfering in America\u2019s elections would have been impermissible by law and unacceptable to the people. The rules of our democracy have changed. President Trump \u2014 who brands himself as a new kind of nationalist (without the historical baggage that term lugs around) \u2014 has now turned to the global elite to help him win re-election. Forget George Soros, the Bilderbergs and cosmopolitan consensus. Donald J. Trump has pushed globalism to new, glittering heights. Free trade? Please. Try inviting the world to do everything short of casting a ballot. Not even QAnon could have seen this twist coming. On Thursday, the president again asked Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, to investigate one of his political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Trump went on to ask the same of Xi Jinping, preoccupied though the Chinese leader is at the moment with trying to suffocate a democratic uprising in Hong Kong. A Republican on the White House lawn asking Communist China for help in winning a democratic election isn\u2019t something that prognosticators would have picked for 2019. But that\u2019s where the United States finds itself. But, as they say, don\u2019t hate the player, hate the game. And if those are the new rules, let\u2019s bring in some players who\u2019ve been sitting on the sidelines. Europe, get on over here. At latest count, 70 percent of the population in 25 European countries surveyed \u201clack confidence in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs.\u201d Oomph. Not exactly swing voters. If the European Union is serious about representing the will of its people, its leaders would put their considerable economic, law enforcement and intelligence resources behind an effort to investigate Mr. Trump for any and all potential wrongdoing connected with his global business empire. After all, the American people deserve to know if their president is a crook. Mexico and Latin America? If they\u2019d like to aid in the election of someone other than Mr. Trump, then abrogating arrangements on migration would be a good way to show how much the administration has utterly failed to resolve this longstanding issue. It\u2019d make it tough on the hustings to convince even a MAGA rally that the wall has been built and that get-tough immigration policies \u2014 snakes and gators and moats, oh my! \u2014 have been effective. As for China, well, it\u2019s now got a standing invitation to join in the 2020 election on behalf of the president. But that shouldn\u2019t be the only offer it considers. Want a trade war truce and a little certainty and sanity in the world economy? Maybe working to undermine the president\u2019s re-election is a wiser course of action than helping to destroy Mr. Biden. The choice is Mr. Xi\u2019s. How about Russia? Oh, Russia. Remember when candidate Trump asked you to steal emails to help his campaign and then you did? But, oh, how the monster you\u2019ve made has gotten out of control. All Vladimir Putin wanted to do was sow a little discord, and what happened? Mr. Trump told the Russian ambassador that he didn\u2019t care about their aid and support to the Republican Party in the 2016 elections. Da. Talk about the dog that caught the car. Guess what would really set Americans at one another\u2019s throats in 2020? President Trump losing re-election and refusing to leave office, as he\u2019s hinted he\u2019d do. Just because the Kremlin backed one horse in 2016 doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t switch midstream. Think about it: Relieved of the duties of office, Mr. Trump would be free to refocus executive time on building a tower in Moscow. Shithole countries? You know who the president thinks you are. Anything you\u2019d like to do to swing the 2020 race one way or the other? All investigations welcome! As Vice President Mike Pence said on Thursday about the investigations into Mr. Biden: \u201cThe American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States, or his family, profited from his position.\u201d Ditto the Family Trump. Is the Trump Organization or one of the wayward scions scoring sweetheart deals to build fancy hotels or secure trademarks in your country? Contact The Times or, if you must, @Fahrenthold. At one time, the conventional wisdom was that all elections were local. But Mr. Trump\u2019s lasting contribution to our modest experiment in self-governance has been to invite the world to participate. He is, if you will, the founding father of globalized American Democracy. E pluribus unum.",
