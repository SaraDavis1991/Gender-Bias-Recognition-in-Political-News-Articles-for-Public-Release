      "content": "Six or seven years ago, when he was a conventionally conservative senator from a reliably Republican Western state, John McCain could never have expected to find himself where he is now, all alone in the political catbird seat. One day he's touted as a possible running mate for John Kerry. The next he's assaulted by his own party with the kind of sputtering outrage that makes the target look good and the attacker look silly. House Speaker Dennis Hastert was so flustered by Mr. McCain's criticism of President Bush's wartime tax cuts that he accused the Arizona senator, a former prisoner of war, of knowing nothing about the meaning of sacrifice. All of which must amuse (when it does not pain) a man who relishes irony, political combat and the maverick's role. What's going on with Mr. McCain doesn't mean much for the Democrats; the senator seems to mean it when he says he'll support Mr. Bush, that he won't leave the Republican Party and that he doesn't want to be anybody's vice president. What's important is that over the last few years, Mr. McCain has morphed into a different kind of Republican -- one who's true to the party's most basic values, but with an appeal that transcends the current red-state-blue-state national standoff. This transformation started with his feisty challenge to George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential primaries, when he drew more support from independents than he did from rank-and-file Republicans, and accelerated when he started veering from the party line on a range of issues. Most notable has been his break with the White House on energy and the environment. Once a reliable oil-and-gas man, he seemed genuinely shaken by evidence of the effects of global warming, and has since teamed up with Democrats like Joseph Lieberman to fight for greater fuel efficiency, cleaner power plants and other environmentally useful objectives. Environmentalism was, of course, a Republican issue first. Mr. McCain has simply rediscovered an old party value. The same thing is true of his longstanding fiscal conservatism. Here again he finds himself at odds with the White House and people like Mr. Hastert, who seem fixated on tax cuts however disastrous their budgetary consequences. Currently, he is part of a lonely band of four Republican moderates in the Senate -- the others are Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine, and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island -- who have bravely blocked passage of a budget that fails to balance huge tax cuts with either spending reductions or other revenue increases. Until Newt Gingrich and his Contract With America gang of rebellious reactionaries roared into town after the 1994 midterm elections, there were quite a few Republicans in Washington like John McCain who thought highly of balanced budgets. There was actually one in the White House, also named Bush, who raised taxes in a necessary if politically painful attempt to bring the deficit under control. But the McCains of this world are increasingly rare birds, and therein lies the strongest reason why he should resist the siren call of presidential politics and remain where he is and who he is. The gradual disappearance of moderates from the Republican landscape has helped neither the party nor the country. Mr. McCain's voice is more than a voice of bipartisan good sense. In time, it could lead the Republican Party back to where it once was and where it ought to be now.",

      "content": " It turns out that John McCain\u2019s most important service to American democracy was not rendered in a P.O.W. camp in Vietnam. It\u2019s being rendered right now in the U.S. Senate. In the first place, McCain seems to be the only member of Congress who insists on holding hearings and working toward compromise before passing major legislation. This would seem to be the very elemental prerequisite of good government \u2014 like a doctor seeking a diagnosis before performing surgery \u2014 but McCain appears to be the only member, or at least the only Republican, willing to risk unpopularity to insist upon a basic respect for our sacred institutions. Second, McCain is one of very few Republicans willing to stand up for the American story. Human beings can be rallied around one of three things: religion, tribe or ideals. Donald Trump and the campus multiculturalists want to organize people by ethnic tribe, which has always been the menacing temptation throughout our history. But McCain seeks to preserve our traditional rallying point \u2014 our ideals. My colleague Bret Stephens has already quoted from McCain\u2019s speech on Monday at the National Constitution Center. I\u2019d encourage you to read the whole thing because this should be the rallying cry around which the nation rediscovers its soul. Third and most important, McCain still believes that paideia is essential for democracy. Paideia is the process by which we educate one another for citizenship. Paideia is based on the idea that a healthy democracy requires a certain sort of honorable citizen \u2014 that if we\u2019re not willing to tell one another the truth, devote our lives to common purposes or defer to a shared moral order, then we\u2019ll succumb to the shallowness of a purely commercial civilization, we\u2019ll be torn asunder by the centrifugal forces of extreme individualism, we\u2019ll rip one another to shreds in the naked struggle for power. As the brilliant Spanish philosopher Javier Gom\u00e1 Lanz\u00f3n reminds us, most moral education happens by power of example. We publish the book of our lives every day through our actions, and through our conduct we teach one another what is worthy of admiration and what is worthy of disdain. Public figures are the primary teachers in this mutual education. Our leaders have outsize influence in either weaving the moral order by their good example or ripping it to shreds by their bad example. McCain\u2019s career has had its low moments, as all of ours do \u2014 a banking scandal, Sarah Palin \u2014 but he exemplifies a practical standard of excellence to an extraordinary degree: enduring in Vietnam, seeking compromise legislation on everything from immigration reform to campaign spending, condemning torture after 9/11. Moreover, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another politician now living who devotes so much of his speeches to little biographies of his own exemplars, people like James Stockdale, Bud Day, Morris Udall and Master Sgt. Roy Benavidez. He has turned his own heroes into educational resources for his country, and used them to evangelize our national ideals. These sorts of testimonies help weave a shared moral order, which is necessary to unite, guide and motivate a diverse country. That is an essential bulwark in the age of Trump. That is what needs rebuilding. Books will someday be written on how Trump, this wounded and twisted man, became morally acceptable to tens of millions of Americans. But it must have something to do with the way over the past decades we have divorced private and public morality, as if private narcissism would have no effect on public conduct. It must have something to do with the great tide of moral libertarianism from Herbert Marcuse on down. This tide taught that progress meant emancipating the individual from shared moral orders. It taught transgression was always delightful and that morality was individual and optional. The acceptability of Trump must also have something to do with millions of religious voters being willing to abandon the practical wisdom of their faiths \u2014 that what exists inside a person is more important than what is external, that no bad tree yields good fruit, that you should never trade spiritual humility for worldly ferocity because in humility there is strength and in pride there is self-destruction. We\u2019ve reached a point in which the tasks of paideia have been abandoned and neglected. \u201cOne could say,\u201d Gom\u00e1 writes in his book \u201cPublic Exemplarity,\u201d \u201cthat we are looking for the ideal of a virtuous republic composed of citizens relieved of the burden of citizenship.\u201d It\u2019s not working out. Gom\u00e1 continues, \u201cIn a time of freedom such as ours marked by subjectivism and vulgarity, a tolerance not tempered by virtue will lead inevitably toward barbarism.\u201d Barbarism and vulgarity we have in profusion. Through his daily utterances, Trump is influencing the nation in powerful ways, but none would call it paideia. Few would say he is spreading a contagion that we\u2019d like our children to catch. The moral fabric of society is invisible but essential. Some use their public position to dissolve it so they can have an open space for their selfishness. McCain is one of the strongest reweavers we have, and one of our best and most stubborn teachers.",

      "content": "Senator John McCain, whose new book is \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d thinks all children should read \u201cHuckleberry Finn\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s funny and it\u2019s scary, and it teaches us to see past our differences.\u201d What books are on your nightstand? \u201cSinatra: The Chairman,\u201d by James Kaplan; \u201cReturn of a King: The Battle for Afghanistan, 1839-42,\u201d by William Dalrymple; and \u201cLeonardo da Vinci,\u201d by Walter Isaacson. Tell us about the last great book you read. Not long ago I reread \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d and was impressed again by the beauty of the prose and the distinctiveness of the style. Fitzgerald told his editor he wanted to write \u201csomething new,\u201d and he did. Nearly a century later, it still reads as something new and different though its subject, the tragedy of desiring most what Ernest Shackleton called the \u201cveneer of outside things,\u201d is an old one. What books do you think most accurately depict Washington? \u201cAdvise and Consent,\u201d by Allen Drury. The characters have mixed motives. Their personalities are complex and their actions nuanced. They\u2019re not all good or all bad, just as in real politics and real life. The story features foreign intrigue and scandal \u2014 as do many fictional treatments of Washington \u2014 but it\u2019s without the simplified, single dimension that fiction by writers from somewhere else often impose on human behavior in this company town. What\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever read about governance? And the military? \u201cThe Best and the Brightest,\u201d by David Halberstam, for governance, and \u201cThis Kind of War,\u201d T. R. Fehrenbach\u2019s classic study of the Korean War. Both concern tactical and strategic mistakes by smart, experienced people, who had more confidence than humility and more intelligence than insight. What books do you think best capture your own political principles? Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls.\u201d It\u2019s my favorite novel of all time. It instructed me to see the world as it is, with all its corruption and cruelty, and believe it\u2019s worth fighting for anyway, even dying for. No just cause is futile, even if it\u2019s lost, if it helps make the future better than the past. What are the best books you\u2019ve read about Vietnam? \u201cHell in a Very Small Place\u201d and \u201cStreet Without Joy,\u201d by Bernard Fall, and \u201cA Bright Shining Lie,\u201d by Neil Sheehan. Fall\u2019s two classics on the French Indochina War warned us about the mistakes we should have avoided making in Vietnam. Sheehan\u2019s book examining America\u2019s involvement in Vietnam through the experiences of John Paul Vann shows how we went about making them anyway. Are there books that to you are important that your children read? That all American children read? I\u2019d like any child to read \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d for the reasons I gave for loving it when I first read it as a child. I think I was about 12, and it had an immediate and lasting impact on me. I\u2019d like them to read Twain, too, at least \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\u201d It\u2019s funny and it\u2019s scary, and it teaches us to see past our differences to the inherent dignity we possess in equal measure. And which novelists do you especially enjoy reading? Hemingway, Fitzgerald and W. Somerset Maugham are my favorites. Hemingway for his sense of courage and adventure, and the power of his spare style. Fitzgerald\u2019s evocation of his time and the poetic quality of his prose. And Maugham\u2019s cosmopolitan sensibility, his feel for the personal and social dramas provoked by clashing cultures. They might not be the greatest English language writers of all time, but along with Faulkner, I think they were the best of their time. How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? Morning or night? I\u2019m old-fashioned or maybe just old. I like to hold the book I\u2019m reading, turn its pages, and clap it shut when I\u2019ve finished it. I usually read them one at a time, but sometimes I\u2019ll set one aside for the time it takes to finish another that required my immediate attention. I read newspapers in the morning and books in the evenings and on airplanes. What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most? I read an awful lot as a boy. My father was a voracious reader, and he had a large library. My grandmother had a lot of books in her house, too. I was constantly raiding their collection for books my father had read as a child. My favorites were romantic adventures, like \u201cIvanhoe,\u201d by Sir Walter Scott; \u201cThe Romance of King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table,\u201d by Thomas Malory; and \u201cTreasure Island\u201d and \u201cKidnapped,\u201d by Robert Louis Stevenson. I read and reread almost everything Mark Twain wrote but principally \u201cThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\u201d \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\u201d and \u201cLife on the Mississippi.\u201d If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? Carl Sandburg\u2019s \u201cAbraham Lincoln: The Prairie and the War Years.\u201d If he doesn\u2019t have time to read all six volumes, he could make do with the one-volume edition published in 1954. Despite the liberties Sandburg took with facts and legends, his portrait of Lincoln instructs the reader in the personal virtues that made Lincoln\u2019s an extraordinarily wise, decent and crucial presidency. Who would you want to write your life story? Mark Salter. He\u2019s been helping me write parts of it for 20 years. I think I can trust him to get the rest of it right, and, quoting Huck Finn, to tell the truth, mainly. What do you plan to read next? \u201cGrant,\u201d by Ron Chernow. Historians began revising, some time ago, the earlier judgments of Grant as an unimaginative, bloody-minded general and bumbling president. But some reviews of Chernow\u2019s new biography praised it as a thorough and insightful reappraisal of Grant, who was in truth an original and discerning military strategist, possibly the most influential in the history of the United States, and a brave and decent president. I\u2019m looking forward to it.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House\u2019s directive to hide a Navy destroyer named after Senator John McCain during President Trump\u2019s recent visit to a naval base in Japan was driven, administration officials said on Thursday, by a fear of bad visuals \u2014 the name of the president\u2019s nemesis clearly visible in photographs of him. In truth, it would have been a bad visual for only one person: Mr. Trump. Yet an effort to airbrush an American warship by covering its name with a giant tarp and then hiding it with a barge demonstrates how anxious the Trump administration has become about the grudges of the president. It also shows the extraordinary lengths officials in the bureaucracy are willing to go to avoid provoking Mr. Trump. Sailors from the McCain were not invited to Mr. Trump\u2019s speech on another ship, the Wasp, at the Yokosuka Naval Base, although crew members from most other American ships at the base were, a Navy service member based at Yokosuka said. When several sailors from the McCain \u2014 wearing uniforms that bore the ship\u2019s name and insignia \u2014 turned up anyway at the Wasp to hear Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, they were turned away, the service member said. The service member, who requested anonymity because he was not allowed to speak publicly, said that a gate guard told the two sailors they were not allowed on the Wasp because they were from the McCain. [What you need to know about about the U.S.S. John S. McCain] The hide-the-ship scheme, which Mr. Trump insisted he knew nothing about but called a \u201cwell meaning\u201d gesture, drew a torrent of criticism on Thursday from retired military officers. They said it was an egregious attempt to politicize the armed forces, while Democratic lawmakers termed it petty vindictiveness against a dead war hero. The episode came at the end of a visit in which Mr. Trump had already sided with a foreign dictator against his national security adviser over the threat posed by North Korean missiles, and joined the North Korean regime in heaping ridicule on a former vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr. The email instructing the Navy to obscure the ship, the John S. McCain, came from the White House military operations office, after consultation with a White House advance team working in Japan, according to an administration official. The Navy initially complied with the order by hanging a tarp over the ship\u2019s name. But higher-level officers got wind of the plan and ordered the tarp removed and the barge moved before Mr. Trump arrived. \u201cIt sounds like someone in the chain of command made a boneheaded mistake in judgment,\u201d said Jack Keane, a retired Army general who advises Mr. Trump and said he once tried to broker a reconciliation between him and Mr. McCain. It is not clear, in any event, if Mr. Trump even saw the McCain during his brief visit. He arrived in Yokosuka on Marine One, and addressed the sailors in a hangar bay below decks on the Wasp. The acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, has denied knowing about the White House directive and on Friday during a trip to Singapore said that he would not have moved the ship. But questions about why the Navy has acquiesced to it are likely to dog Mr. Shanahan when he goes before the Senate for his confirmation hearing in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump is not the first president to politicize the military: George W. Bush famously landed on the deck of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln and spoke to sailors under a banner proclaiming \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d during the Iraq war. Nor is he the first president to nurse grudges: Richard M. Nixon once ordered a reference to the \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic\u201d deleted from a speech because it was a \u201cKennedy song,\u201d played at the funeral of Robert F. Kennedy. But Mr. Trump has taken both habits to greater extremes. Some of the nearly 1,000 sailors and Marines at his speech in Japan wore round patches emblazoned with a likeness of Mr. Trump and the words \u201cMake Aircrew Great Again\u201d \u2014 a play on his campaign slogan \u2014 on their flight suits. Critics said Mr. Trump\u2019s animus for Mr. McCain set off a cascade of decisions by lower-level officials that not only dishonored the senator\u2019s memory but also disrespected the sailors who serve on the McCain. In addition to Mr. McCain, the ship is named after his grandfather, John S. McCain Sr., a Navy admiral during World War II, and his father, John S. McCain Jr., an admiral in the Vietnam War era. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond petty,\u201d Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful, and the White House should be embarrassed.\u201d The McCain had already suffered tragedy. The ship, which fired missiles during the Iraq war and survived cat-and-mouse games with Chinese vessels in the South China Sea, was docked at the base in Yokosuka for repairs after a deadly crash off the coasts of Singapore and Malaysia in August 2017, when it collided with a merchant marine vessel. Ten sailors died in the accident. Mr. McCain took a personal interest in the ship, visiting it in 2015 in Vietnam, where he had been held as a prisoner of war. Cmdr. Micah Murphy, who took command of the ship after the accident, once served as a legislative fellow to the senator. He declined to comment on Thursday. Mr. Trump said he would not have ordered the ship to be hidden, but he declined to apologize to the sailors who had been kept out of his speech. And he expressed sympathy for the motivations of his staff. \u201cNow, somebody did it because they thought I didn\u2019t like him, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cThey were well meaning, I will say. I didn\u2019t know anything about it. I would never have done that.\u201d \u201cSo, I wasn\u2019t a fan of John McCain \u2014 I never will be,\u201d he added. \u201cBut certainly, I couldn\u2019t care less whether or not there\u2019s a boat named after his father.\u201d Mr. Trump repeated his reasons for why he disliked Mr. McCain. \u201cJohn McCain killed health care for the Republican Party, and he killed health care for the nation,\u201d Mr. Trump said, a reference to the late senator\u2019s critical vote against the president\u2019s health care proposal in July 2017. Critics faulted Mr. Trump for what they said was a petty war of words against Mr. McCain, who died last year of brain cancer. They also derided him for what they said were his attempts to divide the military. \u201cWe have a long history of keeping our military apolitical,\u201d said Representative Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee who is a former Pentagon official. \u201cThe president\u2019s team felt it was appropriate to politicize this event.\u201d The email from the White House urging the Navy to move the McCain or make sure it was out of sight put officials in a difficult position. The McCain is still undergoing repairs, and moving it from its berth would be tremendously difficult, time consuming and set back the repair schedule. Navy officials struggled to explain why a tarp was hung over the ship\u2019s name, and later, where the president was scheduled to visit. The tarp, they said, was part of efforts to repair the hull; the barge was a painting barge. But other officials offered a different account. They said the initial decisions were made by midlevel officers in Japan, working with the White House advance team. The tarp and barge were removed after more senior Navy officials, in Japan and at the Indo-Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii, thought better of complying with the White House request. There were similar questions about the status of the sailors. Two ships at the base did not participate in the president\u2019s visit: the McCain and the Stethem. Their sailors were given 96-hour weekend liberty for Memorial Day. Sailors from the other ships did not get the long liberty. Officials claimed there was not room for all of the sailors to hear Mr. Trump on the Wasp, an amphibious assault vessel. But they did not explain why the McCain and Stethem were excluded, arguing only that ships were selected to have a broad representation of the sailors on the base. The Navy said that if any sailors were turned away from the Wasp, it was because the space on that ship was scarce. Defenders of Mr. Trump said it was hard to imagine that he would penalize sailors because of his feelings for Mr. McCain. \u201cI expect he would see the sailors on the ship and want to talk to them,\u201d Mr. Keane said, \u201cand deflect the fact that the ship is named after Senator McCain.\u201d But other former military officers were withering in their condemnation of the White House and of the Navy\u2019s role. Barry R. McCaffrey, a retired Army general who served in the Clinton administration, said on Twitter that if Mr. Shanahan knew about the White House\u2019s order, he should resign. Democrats vying to challenge Mr. Trump in 2020 lost no time in seizing on the episode. \u201cJohn McCain was a war hero, should be treated as a war hero \u2014 anything less than that is beneath anyone who doesn\u2019t treat him that way,\u201d Mr. Biden said to reporters in Delaware. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, said: \u201cThis is not a show. Our military is not a prop. Ships and sailors are not to be toyed with for the benefit of a fragile president\u2019s ego.\u201d",

      "content": "  SINGAPORE \u2014 The acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, distanced himself on Friday from a Trump administration decision to try to hide a ship named after Senator John McCain during the president\u2019s visit to a naval base in Japan this week. Mr. Shanahan, who was in Singapore for a security conference, told reporters that he would not have moved the destroyer to keep it out of photos with Mr. Trump. The White House military operations office told the Navy to block the ship from view, and it complied by at first placing a tarp over the name of Mr. McCain, a fierce critic of Mr. Trump who died last year, and then moving a barge near the vessel. \u201cI would not have moved the ship,\u201d said Mr. Shanahan, who is facing a tough Senate confirmation battle. \u201cI would not have given that direction.\u201d Mr. Shanahan has strenuously denied that he was aware of either the White House request or any moves the Navy made to comply with it. He said that he had asked his chief of staff to get to the bottom of the issue and that he hoped to have answers soon. [What you need to know about the U.S.S. John S. McCain] \u201cOur business is to run military operations and not become politicized,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump, for his part, said on Thursday that he did not know about the effort to hide the ship and would not have ordered it to be obscured, but he expressed sympathy for his staff. \u201cNow, somebody did it because they thought I didn\u2019t like him, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to Mr. McCain. \u201cThey were well meaning, I will say. I didn\u2019t know anything about it. I would never have done that.\u201d Mr. Trump routinely shrugs off the conventions of his office, like avoiding actions that inject politics into military affairs. It would be much more politically difficult for Mr. Shanahan to dodge questions about an episode like the measures taken to obscure the ship. Mr. Shanahan\u2019s confirmation hearing in the Senate is expected in June, although no date has been set, and he is expected to face tough questioning from Mr. McCain\u2019s former colleagues. Even before the dispute about the ship, Mr. Shanahan was under scrutiny for his lack of military experience and his deep ties to Boeing. On issues like Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals for a border wall and Space Force, Mr. Shanahan has taken pains to support White House requests, many of which were delayed by his predecessor, Jim Mattis. But senators on both sides of the aisle viewed Mr. Mattis as a sturdy check on Mr. Trump, and Mr. Shanahan\u2019s efforts to avoid angering his boss could cause problems with the lawmakers who will decide whether to confirm him. In Washington, critics said that Mr. Trump\u2019s dislike of Mr. McCain had set off a cascade of decisions by lower-level officials that not only dishonored the senator\u2019s memory but also disrespected the sailors who serve on the ship that carries his name. In addition to Mr. McCain, the ship is named after his grandfather, John S. McCain Sr., a Navy admiral during World War II, and his father, John S. McCain Jr., an admiral in the Vietnam War era. Sailors aboard the McCain were not invited to hear Mr. Trump speak when he boarded a nearby assault ship, the Wasp, but sailors from other American warships at Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan were welcomed aboard. A Navy service member based at Yokosuka said that sailors from the McCain who showed up in uniform to hear Mr. Trump speak were turned away. After the ship\u2019s name was covered with the tarp, high-level officers ordered it taken down, but a barge was then moved in front of the destroyer before Mr. Trump arrived. More than 36 hours after the first reports of the maneuvers surfaced, top Pentagon officials said they were still searching for answers about why the Navy had complied with the White House request. The Navy has also said it is reviewing whether it should reprimand service members who wore red patches that read \u201cMake Aircrew Great Again\u201d \u2014 a play on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign slogan \u2014 on their flight suits during the president\u2019s speech. On Friday afternoon, the area near the Yokosuka base was quiet, with a handful of off-duty American sailors running errands. Giant pictures of Mr. Trump looked down on passers-by from a department store, and a nearby hamburger shop was serving a Trump burger \u2014 more than a pound and a half of beef with peanut butter, topped with sloppy joe sauce and jalape\u00f1os. Sailors near the base said they were aware of the dispute but had otherwise not given it much thought, partly because they were unsure of what had actually happened, but mostly because it was above their pay grade. Some said they had grown used to Mr. Trump\u2019s unorthodox ways and were not surprised that the White House had sought to hide the ship. Rumors, many of them conflicting, abounded, and some insisted the whole affair was \u201cfake news,\u201d echoing one of the president\u2019s favorite lines. Only a handful of sailors expressed concern. They called the decision to cover up the ship disgraceful, and said the biggest issue was the politicization of the military, although there was disagreement over who was to blame.",

      "content": " The White House\u2019s request that the Navy hide a destroyer that honors Senator John McCain during President Trump\u2019s recent trip to Japan has ignited a furor over how the administration, from the president down, has acted toward the Navy veteran and longtime Arizona lawmaker, who died in August 2018. Although Mr. Trump denied personally playing any role in asking the Navy to prevent the U.S.S. John S. McCain from appearing in photographs with the president during his state visit, the disclosure of the White House\u2019s request immediately turned the ship into a political symbol. Here are some questions and answers about the McCain. It is now, but he is not the only John McCain that the ship\u2019s name honors. The McCain was commissioned in 1994, and it was originally named for the senator\u2019s grandfather, Adm. John S. McCain Sr., who commanded a carrier task force in World War II, and father, Adm. John S. McCain Jr., a submarine commander in the war who later rose to head what was then known as United States Pacific Command. The senator, who was John S. McCain III, was added when the warship was rededicated last year. \u201cToday, we add the story of Senator John S. McCain to the spirit of the mighty vessel which already carries the legacy of his father and grandfather,\u201d Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer said then. \u201cAs a warrior and a statesman who has always put country first, Senator John McCain never asked for this honor, and he would never seek it. But we would be remiss if we did not etch his name alongside his illustrious forebears, because this country would not be the same were it not for the courageous service of all three of these great men.\u201d The Navy said that the senator had \u201can active interest\u201d in the ship and its crew, and had visited it during a trip to Vietnam in 2017. The McCain is a destroyer whose home port is Yokosuka, Japan, where the United States maintains a naval base. Nicknamed \u201cBig Bad John,\u201d the ship is 505 feet long and has a crew of 338 people. The ship launched Tomahawk missiles as a part of the United States\u2019 invasion of Iraq in 2003, but it has spent most of its time in the waters around East Asia and participated in relief efforts after an earthquake struck Japan in 2011. The McCain collided with an oil tanker near Singapore in August 2017, killing 10 American sailors and prompting a Navy investigation and the removal of the ship\u2019s two top officers. The chief of naval operations, Adm. John M. Richardson, said that the collision had been \u201cavoidable.\u201d The McCain has been undergoing repairs and left dry dock in November, according to the Navy, which said the work on the ship was expected to be finished later this year. The Phoenix City Council voted in 2017 to name an airport terminal after Mr. McCain, and Arizona State University is home to the McCain Institute for International Leadership. Last year, not long after Mr. McCain died, an Arizona school district decided to name a planned new elementary school for him. \u201cThe qualities that Senator McCain so passionately and effectively represented are what we wish to enshrine as a model for the children of our community,\u201d Kristi Sandvik, the superintendent of schools, said last year. Other suggestions to name buildings for Mr. McCain \u2014 including a Senate office building in Washington and the Brussels headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \u2014 have so far faltered. Not long before Mr. McCain died, Mr. Trump signed a $716 billion military spending bill that had been named for the ailing senator. The president did not mention Mr. McCain or the formal name of the legislation, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, during a speech and a signing ceremony.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Mick Mulvaney, President Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, sought on Sunday to play down the White House\u2019s directive to hide a Navy destroyer named after Senator John McCain during the president\u2019s visit to a naval base in Japan last week. Mr. Mulvaney said that a young White House staff member, knowing of Mr. Trump\u2019s animosity toward  Mr. McCain, most likely made the request to the Navy to block the warship from view. The Navy at first complied, placing a giant tarp over the name and then hiding it with a barge before senior admirals reversed the decision. \u201cIf a 23- or 24-year-old person says, \u2018Look, is it really a good idea for this ship to be in the background?\u2019 that is not an unreasonable question,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d adding, \u201cWe think it\u2019s much ado about nothing.\u201d Asked about the matter on NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said it would be \u201csilly\u201d to fire the aide over the episode, which has drawn a torrent of criticism from retired military officers. Mr. Trump insisted last week that he knew nothing about the hide-the-ship scheme, but called it a \u201cwell meaning\u201d gesture. The acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, had also said he was unaware of the White House directive, and on Sunday warned the White House in his strongest language yet not to politicize the nation\u2019s armed forces, which have traditionally been viewed as apolitical. \u201cThere is no room for politicizing the military,\u201d Mr. Shanahan told reporters traveling with him to Seoul, South Korea. Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Mr. Shanahan, said in a statement that the secretary\u2019s chief of staff had conveyed that same message to the White House military office. Mr. Shanahan had told reporters during a security conference in Singapore on Friday that he would not have moved the destroyer to keep it out of photos with Mr. Trump, and asked his chief of staff to get to the bottom of things. On Sunday, Mr. Shanahan said he did not plan to call for an inspector general investigation into the incident, for which Navy officials have blamed a group of lower-level Navy planning officers and a midlevel White House advance team. In addition to Mr. McCain, the ship is named after his grandfather, John S. McCain Sr., a Navy admiral during World War II, and his father, John S. McCain Jr., an admiral in the Vietnam War era. Sailors aboard the McCain were not invited to hear Mr. Trump speak on a nearby amphibious assault ship, the Wasp, but sailors from other American warships at Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan were welcomed aboard. Even though Mr. Shanahan has denied knowing about the White House directive, questions about why the Navy initially acquiesced to it are likely to dog him when he goes before the Senate for his confirmation hearing in the coming weeks.",

      "content": "  The White House asked the Navy to hide a destroyer named after Senator John McCain in order to avoid having the ship appear in photographs taken while President Trump was visiting Japan this week, White House and military officials said Wednesday. Although Navy officials insisted they did not hide the ship, the John S. McCain, they did give all of the sailors aboard the day off on Tuesday as Mr. Trump visited Yokosuka Naval Base. Two Navy sailors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that the McCain sailors were not invited to hear Mr. Trump speak that day aboard the amphibious assault ship Wasp, while sailors from other American warships at the base were. [What you need to know about about the U.S.S. John S. McCain] A Navy service member based on Yokosuka said that all of the American warships in the harbor were invited to send 60 to 70 sailors to hear Mr. Trump\u2019s address, with the exception of the McCain. When several sailors from the McCain showed up anyway, wearing their uniforms with the ship\u2019s insignia, they were turned away, the service member said. White House aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly, confirmed the request was made but said that Mr. Trump did not know about it. A United States official said on Wednesday that the White House sent an email to the Navy with the request on May 15. But the president denied on Twitter on Wednesday night having any involvement: \u201cI was not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S. McCain during my recent visit to Japan.\u201d [Here\u2019s the latest on what President Trump said about efforts to hide the Navy destroyer.] Mr. McCain, of Arizona, who died last year from brain cancer, was derided repeatedly during his life by Mr. Trump, who once disparaged Mr. McCain\u2019s service because he had been held as a war prisoner in Vietnam, saying, \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d The president\u2019s animosity toward the senator did not subside with his death. Navy officials approached last week by The New York Times about plans for the McCain during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit declined to comment. But one official said on Thursday that sailors aboard the destroyer were told to hide signs that identified that warship during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit. The White House request to hide the name of Mr. Trump\u2019s rival, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is the second episode to engulf the Navy in Mr. Trump\u2019s single visit to the Wasp. At least a few service members wore round patches emblazoned with a likeness of Mr. Trump and the words \u201cMake Aircrew Great Again\u201d \u2014 a play on the president\u2019s campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d \u2014 on their flight suits while listening to their commander in chief speak. Images of the patches promptly went viral. \u201cThey\u2019re inappropriate & against regulation,\u201d tweeted Mark Hertling, a retired three-star Army general. Just days later, the Navy was embroiled in the McCain news. \u201cAll ships remained in normal configuration during the president\u2019s visit,\u201d said Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a Navy spokesman. The acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, denied knowledge of the White House request. \u201cWhen I read about it this morning, it was the first I\u2019ve heard about it,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday during an appearance with his Indonesian counterpart in Jakarta. Asked if he planned to order an investigation into the matter, he said, \u201cI want to find out a little bit more.\u201d The Wasp, an amphibious assault ship that hosts the new F-35B Lightning fighter jets, had actually been in Sasebo, Japan, and was moved to Yokosuka in time for the president\u2019s visit. [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about the military, conflict and consequence.] The Chief of Naval Information, the public affairs arm of the Navy, posted on Twitter for the first time in five and a half years over the matter. \u201cThe name of the U.S.S. John S. McCain was not obscured during the POTUS visit to Yokosuka on Memorial Day,\u201d the Navy said, using an acronym for president of the United States. Mr. Shanahan later told reporters aboard his flight to Singapore that he was going to ask his chief of staff to look into what happened. \u201cI would never dishonor the memory of a great American patriot like Senator McCain,\u201d he said. He also added that \u201cI\u2019d never disrespect the young men and women that crew that ship,\u201d a reference to reports that sailors from the McCain who were wearing uniforms with the ship\u2019s insignia were turned away from Mr. Trump\u2019s speech. The disclosure that the Navy entertained a request to hide a warship named after an American war hero from a president who did not serve is likely to resurface questions about whether Mr. Trump has politicized the military. Mr. Shanahan, the president\u2019s pick to become defense secretary \u2014 and who will soon be visiting Tokyo after his time in Jakarta \u2014 has taken pains  to go along with White House requests, many of which were delayed by his predecessor, Jim Mattis. But this effort could make Mr. Shanahan\u2019s confirmation fight in Congress more difficult. The destroyer John S. McCain is named after the senator, as well as his grandfather, John S. McCain Sr., a Navy admiral during World War II, and his father, John S. McCain Jr., an admiral in the Vietnam era. Meghan McCain, John McCain\u2019s daughter, spoke out on Twitter on Wednesday night against the White House request. Ms. McCain, who has rebuked the president over how he has spoken about her father, wrote that Mr. Trump was \u201cthreatened by the greatness of my dads incredible life,\u201d adding that in the \u201cnine months since he passed, Trump won\u2019t let him RIP.\u201d",

      "content": " For the White House staff, a United States Navy destroyer and its crew command less respect than the president\u2019s fragile ego. During his trip to Japan this week, President Trump was given a tour of the Yokosuka Naval Base. In preparation for his visit on Tuesday, the White House had requested that the Navy hide the U.S.S. John S. McCain, a destroyer bearing the name of the senator and Trump nemesis who died last August. Sailors aboard the ship were given the day off and, unlike colleagues from other vessels, pointedly not invited to attend Mr. Trump\u2019s speech aboard another warship. Sailors from the McCain who showed up anyway, with the ship\u2019s name on their uniforms or caps, were turned away. When news of the effort became public, Mr. Trump responded \u2014 first on Twitter and later to reporters \u2014 that he\u2019d had nothing to do with the decision. He probably didn\u2019t. He nonetheless acknowledged his enduring dislike of Mr. McCain and praised whoever had been responsible for the ship kerfuffle as \u201cwell meaning.\u201d Mr. Trump seems to think that blaming an overzealous aide for the incident makes things better and absolves him of any responsibility. In reality, it makes things worse. It seems we have reached a point where the president of the United States is considered such a snowflake by his own staff members that they tripped over themselves to avoid having him even see the name of someone he didn\u2019t like \u2014 a Navy hero tortured in a North Vietnamese prison while the future president\u2019s bone spurs kept him out of the service \u2014 that was inconveniently emblazoned on a destroyer within his line of sight. It\u2019s no secret that Mr. Trump\u2019s ego is fragile. At the start of his tenure, he was so upset that his inauguration crowd had been smaller than Barack Obama\u2019s that he had his press secretary lie about it and prompted the park service to edit photos to make his crowd look larger. Similarly, unable to cope with having lost the popular vote, the president formed an \u201celection integrity\u201d commission to try to prove that the election had been riddled with fraud on behalf of Hillary Clinton. It found none and was dissolved. Two years on, the situation has become more absurd. Staff members have so internalized their boss\u2019s vanities and petty grudges that they scurry to avoid anything that might offend his sense of self. The McCain episode may sound largely harmless, even if it showed further politicization of the military. This was, after all, the same event at which some service members were photographed wearing patches with an image of the president surrounded by the words \u201cMake Aircrew Great Again\u201d \u2014 a play on Mr. Trump\u2019s MAGA campaign slogan. So it may be too much to expect anyone in this administration to think twice about such niceties. But other instances of the president\u2019s fragility are deadly serious. In late April, it came to light that the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, had warned Kirstjen Nielsen, then the homeland security secretary, against raising the issue of Russia\u2019s attempts to interfere in American elections in front of the president. Ms. Nielsen was desperate to get the White House to show leadership and focus public attention on this critical threat. But Mr. Mulvaney told her that the entire issue was tangled up in Mr. Trump\u2019s brain with questions about the legitimacy of his 2016 victory. And so the integrity of the American electoral system is being neglected because White House aides don\u2019t want to risk hurting Mr. Trump\u2019s feelings. Who knows what other important issues are being similarly compromised? One has to wonder whether, somewhere in the White House computer system, there is a running list of topics that cannot be broached, lest they trigger the volatile Mr. Trump.",

And it\u2019s all too easy to make a small mistake in a policy detail that offends a key constituency or potential ally. But so far, Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan for that\u201d campaign seems to have been worth it \u2014 at least in the sense that it has elevated her into the top tier of candidates in very early polls and nudged other candidates to get more serious and ambitious about their own policy proposals. For Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters, it\u2019s a point of pride: To back her is to treat politics as a matter of substance, to see beyond the shiny personal story and youthful charisma of candidates such as Pete Buttigieg or Beto O\u2019Rourke, whom even a supporter recently described as \u201ca blank slate that is waiting to be filled by our dreams and aspirations.\u201d But Ms. Warren is of course a personality, too, not just the human face on a binder of policy papers. The policy documents are the personality. What\u2019s in them matters less than the fact that she cares enough to produce them, and the story they tell about who she is, how she made her way from Oklahoma, the University of Houston and early parenthood to Harvard Law School, the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency and the Senate \u2014 and how she would operate as president. The story her proposals tell is not just one of diligence, but also an ability to identify forces that don\u2019t get much attention, don\u2019t appear on polls and don\u2019t have well-organized constituencies, but matter in people\u2019s lives. In the mid-2000s, as a law professor, she sounded the alarm about proposed changes to bankruptcy rules, an issue on which there was almost no organized opposition to the interests of banks and credit card companies. That methodology is central to her identity. And that\u2019s appropriate. We don\u2019t elect presidents just to execute plans; we elect human beings, expecting them to deal with global crises and economic twists we can\u2019t yet foresee. For some, like Barack Obama, it\u2019s inspiring, inclusive rhetoric that convinces us to trust them in that position; for others, it\u2019s a personal story, such as military service. In the case of Donald Trump, to reach beyond his angriest core of supporters, it was the idea that he\u2019d been so successful in business that he could do better than the \u201cvery stupid people\u201d in Washington. But policy plans and positions can serve the same purpose, showing that a candidate is prepared for challenges, able to absorb a huge amount of information and opposing views, and make decisive choices \u2014 the very thing a president does in a crisis. There are other good examples of candidates using plans and issue positions to tell a story about themselves: When John McCain made campaign-finance reform a centerpiece of his 2000 and 2008 campaigns, it wasn\u2019t because voters, particularly Republican primary voters, cared so much about the issue, in that pre-Citizens United era. The issue told the right story about Mr. McCain: a maverick willing to challenge leadership and lobbyists of his own party. Someone, furthermore, who had learned from his entanglement in the late-1980s Keating Five scandal (in which a group of senators were exposed for interceding with bank regulators on behalf of a donor). And someone willing to form cross-partisan alliances to get things done. For others, especially in a wide-open field like the current Democrats, the policy positions they take are really markers of their political positioning: Will they be confrontational, proposing ambitious policies that no Republicans will support, or accommodating, as with some of the less controversial ideas in Senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s 137-point plan for her first hundred days? There are still risks to a policy-heavy candidacy. Every detail is a choice, and every choice is a potential vulnerability. In 2007, for example, Mr. Obama chose not to include an individual mandate to purchase health insurance in his health reform proposal, arguing that people wanted to be insured and so didn\u2019t need to be compelled. Hillary Clinton assailed him for weeks over the 15 million people she said his plan would leave out as a result. Too many plans can also hinder a campaign\u2019s effort to send a clear and coherent message, as was probably the case for Mrs. Clinton\u2019 in 2016. Candidates can avoid that by embracing an ideological label that unites all their plans, as Senator Bernie Sanders has done with democratic socialism. Ms. Warren, who calls herself a capitalist who wants to make markets work, has so far been able to avoid the risk of incoherence because most of her proposals reflect that theme. Finally, off in the distance, there\u2019s a risk that policy plans will be seen as a false promise. The next president won\u2019t simply be able to carry out those plans, and probably shouldn\u2019t try. If the Office of Management and Budget and key federal agencies can be restored to full capacity, and with external organizations providing more help than they can to a candidate, the next White House can probably produce better plans, spotting more potential problems, than a handful of policy analysts on a campaign. And aside from a few things that can be achieved by executive order or appointment, it\u2019s Congress that has to follow through. Even if a Democratic president wins in a wave and brings along a Democratic Senate, those senators will need to be willing to scrap the filibuster or otherwise overcome obstruction from the other party. And even if all that happens, each member of Congress will have his or her own demands or local interests that will require bargaining on key points. But for now, detailed policy plans can serve an essential purpose, which is to tell voters what kind of person each candidate is.",

      "content": " On the morning of June 23, 2014, an F-35 burst into flames just moments before its pilot was set to take off on a routine training mission. He heard a loud bang and felt the engine slow as warning indicators began flashing \u201cfire\u201d and other alerts signaled that systems in the plane were shutting down. Witnesses at Eglin Air Force Base near Pensacola, Fla., reported seeing the pilot escape from the cockpit and run away from the fighter jet, which was engulfed in thick plumes of black smoke. It was the first major mishap involving a F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and it couldn\u2019t have happened at a worse time. In less than a month, the F-35, America\u2019s high-profile next-generation fighter jet, was poised to make its international debut in Britain at Farnborough Airshow, the second-largest event of its kind in the world. Officials from the Pentagon and the aircraft\u2019s manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, had eagerly anticipated the opportunity to show off a working, flying F-35 after a decade of delays and spiraling cost overruns. The F-35 initiative is the Defense Department\u2019s most expensive weapons program ever, expected to cost taxpayers more than $1 trillion over its 60-year lifespan. It\u2019s also the United States military\u2019s most ambitious international partnership, with eight other nations investing in the aircraft\u2019s development. Its advocates promised that the jet would be a game-changing force in the future of war \u2014 so much was riding on its success that a program cancellation was not an option. And yet for years it seemed as if the F-35 might never make it beyond its development phase. Christopher Bogdan, the Air Force lieutenant general in charge of the program at the time of the fire, received a call about the incident within the hour. His first reaction was relief that it had been detected before takeoff, a stroke of good fortune that allowed the pilot to escape uninjured. \u201cIf that engine problem would have occurred 30 seconds, 60 seconds, two minutes later, that airplane would have been airborne,\u201d Bogdan said in a recent interview. \u201cHeaven knows what could have happened then.\u201d [For more stories about the experiences and costs of war, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.] An investigation of the incident determined that a fan blade in the jet\u2019s engine had overheated from friction and cracked, throwing off fragments of metal that punched through the fuselage, severed hydraulic and fuel lines and ignited a spray of jet fuel. Officials couldn\u2019t guarantee that other F-35s wouldn\u2019t have the same problem, and they didn\u2019t want to risk a potentially catastrophic fire during a trans-Atlantic flight. The F-35 never made it to Farnborough that year, and the public-relations coup that Pentagon and Lockheed officials had hoped for turned into another round of ammunition for the plane\u2019s critics. It was one more bad news story for a controversial program that had been dogged by bad news. Slowly, though, the program and its reputation have improved over the ensuing five years. Lockheed has now delivered more than 400 planes to American and foreign militaries, and the unit cost per aircraft has dropped significantly. In 2018, the F-35 completed its first combat operation for the Marine Corps in Afghanistan. The Air Force used it for airstrikes in Iraq about six months later. Later this year or in early 2020, the F-35 will go into full-rate production, with Lockheed expected to churn out 130 to 160 or more planes per year, a huge step up from the 91 planes delivered in 2018. That production milestone will be a symbolic turning point for the program, evidence that major problems that plagued the Joint Strike Fighter in the past are now history. Yet even as the program plows forward, unresolved technical issues have continued to emerge. In June, my colleagues and I at Defense News reported that the plane still faced at least 13 severe technical deficiencies during operational testing, including spikes in cabin pressure, some rare instances of structural damage at supersonic speeds and unpredictability while conducting extreme maneuvers \u2014 all problems that could affect the pilot\u2019s safety or jeopardize a mission\u2019s success. At the same time, the F-35s already delivered to squadrons have introduced new complications: On military bases around the United States, the high cost of operating the aircraft, a shortage of spare parts and a challenging new approach to updating the jet\u2019s crucial software code have program officials and military leaders urgently looking for solutions. Still, they assure the public that nothing will prevent the program from moving forward. It\u2019s a stance that breaks with the advice of the Government Accountability Office, which advised that all serious problems should be resolved before transitioning to full-rate production. With the critical problems that once dominated both headlines and congressional hearings seemingly resolved, the F-35 may not be the high-profile problem child it once was. But the Pentagon\u2019s efforts to play down new complications raise questions about whether America\u2019s most controversial warplane is actually ready to move into its next phase and what kind of new problems might surface in that transition. The Joint Strike Fighter program was conceived in the 1990s as the most ambitious aircraft development effort in the Defense Department\u2019s history. One company would oversee design and production of three different versions of an aircraft that could be operated by the United States Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as America\u2019s allies, who would help offset the development costs. The project would result in a technologically superior plane that would be manufactured in such large quantities that the jets would cost no more than the older planes it would replace. The jet was to replace a wide variety of the American military\u2019s combat aircraft, including the Air Force\u2019s F-16 Fighting Falcon and A-10 Thunderbolt II, the Marine Corps\u2019s AV-8B Harrier and the F/A-18 Hornet operated by the Navy and Marine Corps. All of the services\u2019 requirements for new fighter jets were combined into one program, which would be awarded to a single contractor. Like the Air Force\u2019s F-22, this new fighter jet needed to be stealthy and able to fly at supersonic speeds. To meet the needs of the Marine Corps, it needed to land vertically on ships, while the Navy version would need larger wings and different landing gear so it could take off from and land on aircraft carriers. \u201cIf you were to go back to the year 2000 and somebody said, \u2018I can build an airplane that is stealthy and has vertical takeoff and landing capabilities and can go supersonic,\u2019 most people in the industry would have said that\u2019s impossible,\u201d said Tom Burbage, Lockheed\u2019s general manager for the program from 2000 to 2013. \u201cThe technology to bring all of that together into a single platform was beyond the reach of industry at that time.\u201d Lockheed Martin thought otherwise. In 2001, the defense company\u2019s model \u2014 then called the X-35 \u2014 won against Boeing\u2019s X-32 after both companies demonstrated working prototypes of a stealth fighter capable of hovering and vertical landings. There soon turned out to be an essential flaw in the grand plan for a single plane that could do everything. Design specifications demanded by one branch of the military would adversely impact the F-35\u2019s performance in another area. \u201cIt turns out when you combine the requirements of the three services, what you end up with is the F-35, which is an aircraft that is in many ways suboptimal for what each of the services really want,\u201d said Todd Harrison, an aerospace expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt is much more expensive than originally envisioned, and the three versions of the plane actually don\u2019t have that much in common.\u201d But early in the program, Lockheed Martin began construction with glowing optimism. The company decided to build the Air Force\u2019s F-35A first because it was considered the simplest model, then move on to the difficulties of the F-35B short-takeoff and vertical-landing version and then the F-35C, which can land on an aircraft carrier \u2014 a decision that turned out to be a mistake. Once Lockheed\u2019s engineers proceeded with the more demanding design of the F-35B, they found that their initial weight estimates were no longer accurate and the B model was on track to be 3,000 pounds too heavy to meet specifications. The company was forced to begin an extensive redesign project that added an 18-month delay to the program. Later, serious problems resulted from starting production while the aircraft was still under development, a process the Pentagon calls concurrency. The strategy was meant to allow the services to begin flying their F-35s sooner. Instead, F-35s started rolling off the production line with unresolved technical problems, forcing the Pentagon to continually retrofit even newly built jets. In 2010, the ballooning costs \u2014 which put the cost per plane more than 89 percent over the baseline estimate \u2014 triggered a breach of the Nunn-McCurdy Act, a law that forces the Pentagon and Congress to evaluate whether to cancel a troubled program. But because the F-35 was intended to replace so many legacy fighter jets, military leaders essentially had no choice but to keep going. One factor that kept sending the F-35 program off course was the level of control Lockheed exerted over the program. The company produces not only the F-35 itself but also the training gear for pilots and maintainence technicians, the aircraft\u2019s logistics system and its support equipment, like carts and rigs. Lockheed also manages the supply chain and is responsible for much of the maintenance for the plane. This gave Lockheed significant power over almost every part of the F-35 enterprise. \u201cI had a sense, after my first 90 days, that the government was not in charge of the program,\u201d said Bogdan, who assumed oversight as the program\u2019s executive officer in December 2012. It seemed \u201cthat all of the major decisions, whether they be technical, whether they be schedule, whether they be contractual, were really all being made by Lockheed Martin, and the program office was just kind of watching.\u201d Bogdan particularly worried that Lockheed had too much control of the government\u2019s test flights. The company was allowed to manage the test program and had the power, for example, to defer more challenging tests until later. In past programs, the government had controlled testing and had aimed to find any difficult, high-priority problems early, so they could be addressed as soon as possible. Bogdan also argued that the Pentagon\u2019s program office was not transparent enough in letting the military services know how their money was being spent. Because Lockheed was not required to report its financials in detail, the program office itself did not have a clear picture of exactly how much an F-35 truly cost and how the money was being used. Costs and complications were spiraling. Someone needed to intervene before the Defense Department lost control entirely, Bogdan thought. In September 2012, when he was the program\u2019s second-in-command, he took to the lectern at the Air Force\u2019s largest conference and said something that had not been publicly acknowledged before: The relationship with Lockheed was the worst arrangement he had ever seen between the Pentagon and a defense contractor. The audience was shocked. At military conferences and trade shows, Defense Department officials and their contractors typically boast about their collaborative efforts. Instead, Bogdan publicly shamed the defense behemoth, criticizing the lagging production time and skyrocketing costs. At that point, there was a lot to rebuke. The Pentagon had restricted the F-35 from flying near thunderstorms after flight tests revealed that its lightning-protection system was deficient. That became easy fodder for skeptics, given the plane\u2019s designation as the F-35 Lightning II. The jet\u2019s cutting-edge helmet display, which melds imagery from the F-35\u2019s multiple cameras and sensors into a single picture, didn\u2019t work properly, with pilots experiencing a jittery, delayed video feed. And the jet\u2019s software development had lagged behind schedule, leaving pilots stuck with an interim version that allowed only for basic training. When Bogdan was promoted to the top post as the program\u2019s executive officer, a rule change empowered him to stay on past the previous two-year limit, and he let Lockheed know that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere until the F-35\u2019s major difficulties were behind it. The Pentagon and the contractor got to work on correcting the jet\u2019s technical issues, one by one. Within a year, Bogdan was saying publicly that the relationship with Lockheed was improving and that the contractor was making progress in addressing the F-35\u2019s problems, albeit more slowly than he would have liked. The program office and Lockheed had figured out some ways to cut the cost of manufacturing the fighter. More flight testing was happening. The lightning-protection system was redesigned in 2014, and the F-35 can now fly in bad weather. A series of hardware and software changes to the helmet have solved the image-quality problems. Still, as problems were fixed, new ones surfaced. In 2015, the program office found that the plane\u2019s ejection seat could cause serious neck injuries to lightweight pilots, prompting the Air Force to ban pilots under 136 pounds from flight operations until a fix was implemented in 2016. Perhaps most damning was a 2015 report by War Is Boring, a well-read military blog, citing a document by an Air Force test pilot that asserted that the F-35 could not defeat the 1970s-era F-16 in aerial combat. If that was true, the staggeringly expensive high-tech jet was already obsolete before it would ever take to the skies in wartime. It emerged that the assessment was provisional and incomplete. The pilot had based his judgment on a single day\u2019s mock aerial battle between an F-16 and an F-35 that temporarily had limited maneuverability and restricted performance because it had an early version of its software package. Nevertheless, the characterization of the F-35 as an overpriced but mediocre dogfighter has haunted it ever since. Though the F-35\u2019s bad reputation among the public has persisted, the military has grown increasingly confident in the jet\u2019s capabilities as problems have been eliminated and additional weapons and software have made the aircraft more capable in a fight. As more pilots log more flight time, they have raved about the F-35\u2019s performance and technological advances. The Marine Corps, which began normal flying operations with the jet in 2015, became the first military branch to fly the F-35 in combat when it used the jets for airstrikes in Afghanistan last year. Both the Air Force and Navy are also now operating their own F-35s. In 2017, during the F-35A\u2019s first outing in Red Flag, the Air Force\u2019s largest training exercise for aerial warfare, the jet killed 20 aircraft for each F-35 shot down in simulated combat. In April, Air Force pilots took that training and put it into practice for the first time, using the F-35 in an airstrike against ISIS in Iraq. Pressure from Congress also helped shape the F-35 into a more successful program. In 2016, Senator John McCain of Arizona labeled the program a \u201cscandal and a tragedy with respect to cost, schedule and performance.\u201d Recognizing that it was nearly impossible to cancel the program, McCain nevertheless aimed to hold it accountable for its repeated setbacks. He moved forward with a carrot-and-stick approach, approving additional funding for the F-35 as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee while at the same time regularly grilling Defense Department officials during congressional hearings. Since McCain\u2019s death last August, no other lawmaker has exacted that level of scrutiny. That\u2019s by design, said Dan Grazier of the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog organization that has repeatedly criticized the aircraft. \u201cIt\u2019s no accident that there are more than 1,500 suppliers for the F-35 program, and they\u2019re spread out to almost every state,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means that there\u2019s basically a veto-proof constituency bloc on Capitol Hill for the F-35 program, so it becomes very difficult for members of Congress to really criticize this program.\u201d Legislators looking to relieve pressure on the program \u2014 and argue for increasing the number of aircraft purchased annually \u2014 have been able to point to measurable progress in the F-35\u2019s performance and management. But that leniency comes at the expense of taxpayers\u2019 dollars, say critics like Grazier, who want to see lawmakers do more to push for cost savings. Within the last few years, the Defense Department has corrected hundreds of Category 1 deficiencies, the label the Pentagon gives to serious technical problems including ones that could affect safety or mission effectiveness, and many of the F-35\u2019s most visible problems have been resolved. However, as recently as June, at least 13 Category 1 deficiencies were still on the books. \u201cEach is well understood, already resolved or on a near-term path to resolution,\u201d Lockheed said in a statement. Vice Adm. Mat Winter, who led the Pentagon\u2019s F-35 program office until July, maintained that the 13 deficiencies were not ones so serious that they could cause loss of life or aircraft. The department has a plan to fix all but two of the issues \u2014 the two have occurred only once during flight tests and are considered anomalous \u2014 and according to Winter, the problems will not affect the Pentagon\u2019s plan to move to full-rate production. The F-35 was in the news again in July when the White House decided to expel Turkey from the program when that contentious ally refused to give up its plan to simultaneously acquire an advanced air defense system from Russia. That new partnership with Moscow presented a risk that technological secrets from F-35s in Turkey could make their way to Russia. The program\u2019s international reach, meanwhile, is only becoming bigger. Ten international partners and customers have committed to buying the jet, and eight of them have received their first F-35s. Israel was the first country to use the fighter in combat, announcing in May 2018 that it had used the F-35 in two separate airstrikes on undisclosed targets in the Middle East. The cost of the plane continues to decrease as the growth in sales reduces the unit cost per jet, with the price of a conventional F-35A \u2014 the variant purchased by most international customers \u2014 falling to $89.2 million in 2018. Back in 2006, the first batch cost $241.2 million per plane. In June, Lockheed and the Pentagon announced a handshake deal that would see the price of the F-35A drop to the long-awaited level of $80 million, about equal to older planes like the F/A-18 Super Hornet. \u201cThis is going to be the first fighter jet produced in the thousands for a very long time,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group. \u201cNone of this is stoppable. It will be remembered, as the smoke clears, as something that worked far better than critics thought it would, but something you\u2019d never, ever want to do again.\u201d Hill Air Force Base in Utah, home to the Air Force\u2019s first operational F-35s, is tasked with preparing pilots for combat and has some of the highest availability rates among all installations that fly the aircraft \u2014 a key measure that the service uses to track the proportion of aircraft that are operational and ready to fly. But long turnaround times for some maintenance tasks has meant that about 30 percent of the squadron\u2019s aircraft are grounded at any given time. At some bases that fly the older models, the availability rate is far lower: Sometimes more than 60 percent of their F-35s are not operable. In 2017 and 2018, only about half of the F-35 fleet was available to fly at a given time, with the rest down for maintenance. A major cause of F-35s sitting idle on the ground is a shortage of replacement parts. Lockheed and Defense Department officials have blamed each other for the problem, and there probably is plenty of fault to go around. The planes require a dizzying number of components sourced from different suppliers, and replacement parts are not getting to the flight line when they are needed. For instance, F-35s have encountered problems with the canopy, the glass enclosure that protects the cockpit, and jets can sometimes wait for a year to receive the necessary repair. Lockheed has begun fronting its own money to buy spare parts in advance, with the expectation that the Defense Department will repay the company later. It\u2019s also trying to roll all of the F-35\u2019s needs together, so that its suppliers can deliver parts for both new aircraft and old. Winter is skeptical that Lockheed\u2019s actions will fix the problem. \u201cLockheed Martin\u2019s assertion that this will all be done in two years or so was the same thing that was said two years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always two years to success, every time we talk.\u201d But Lockheed is only partly responsible for the shortage of parts. An April 2019 investigation by the Government Accountability Office found that the Pentagon had a repair backlog of about 4,300 parts, wasn\u2019t managing its inventory properly and often lacked data on the cost and current location of its F-35 components. Again, it\u2019s a problem that could be compounded by the move to full-rate production. As Lockheed is responsible for building a much larger number of jets and prioritizes delivering those new aircraft to its customers, the F-35s already in operation will face even stiffer competition for spare parts. Slow and complicated maintenance is not a minor problem. As is generally the case for most weapons systems, maintenance is expected to make up more than 70 percent of the F-35 program\u2019s total cost over the projected lifetime of the program. And managing these costs only grows more critical as more F-35s come online. An important measure of the cost, sustainability and value of the new jet is its total operating cost. In 2018, flying an F-35A cost about $44,000 per hour on average \u2014 about double the cost of operating the Navy\u2019s Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Some of the military\u2019s top officials, including Gen. Dave Goldfein, the Air Force\u2019s chief of staff, and former Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, have complained that it is too expensive to fly and maintain the F-35, raising the possibility that the service may have to buy fewer of them if costs don\u2019t shrink. In 2018, Goldfein called the F-35 \u201ca computer that happens to fly\u201d \u2014 a popular characterization among F-35 advocates, highlighting the plane\u2019s ability to collect and analyze data in order to knock out enemy planes and missiles. But as China develops its own stealth fighters and pumps government money into research on supercomputing and artificial intelligence, the Pentagon is wondering how it can continue to give F-35 technology a competitive edge against America\u2019s adversaries. One solution favored by Winter during his recent tenure was so-called agile software development. His vision for \u201ccontinuous capability development and delivery\u201d resembles DevOps, a popular method in the private sector for quickly testing and evaluating features for new products. Coders generate software upgrades or patches in a matter of days or weeks, pass them along to users to test and then push out the update more widely if the changes are successful. That speed would be a major improvement on the months, or in some cases a year or more, that it can take defense contractors to deliver a software patch right now. Winter also made it a priority to push for drastic streamlining in the process for testing new software in the F-35. Under the existing procedures, the Pentagon can require test flights for more than 300 different factors or functions when a new software load is installed. Winter worked to cut that down to a single validation flight, to test just the software and the systems it affects, rather than retesting the performance of the whole aircraft. A trial program staffed with a team of Air Force and Lockheed coders proved that the method works and doesn\u2019t put pilots at risk, and Winter\u2019s rapid software development strategy is now being implemented. But moving to an agile software approach for the F-35 presents a huge challenge for the sluggish and bureaucratic military acquisition system, and there\u2019s no blueprint for how to integrate it alongside the traditional processes for developing and testing hardware. As with all stories involving the tangled web that is the Pentagon bureaucracy, it\u2019s tempting to try to look for a hidden root behind all the problems \u2014 greedy corporate executives, corrupt generals, the military-industrial complex itself. But those closest to the F-35 program, the engineers, software developers and midlevel managers, express the same things over and over. Frustration that the tremendous scope of the program keeps them from being able to do more to fix it; and a wounded sense of pride for the impressive technological advances they have achieved, but that often seem lost in the intractable tangle of complications and setbacks. Over the next few months, the program will move through grueling evaluations overseen by the Pentagon\u2019s independent weapons tester. These tests are meant to shake out any last bugs before full-rate production starts. In June, Winter said that none of the remaining problems are serious enough to delay full production. But even after the testing ends, there will inevitably be issues in need of fixes. In some ways, that\u2019s a feature of today\u2019s changing battlefield. There will always be new threats to face, new upgrades to develop, new technical problems to solve. Defense Department officials continue to assert that the adaptiveness of the F-35 makes it the best option to stand up to such uncertainties. Which is a good thing if true, given that it\u2019s the only option. Because even if the F-35 doesn\u2019t manage to become the unbeatable plane the Pentagon dreamed of, it has become the unkillable program.",

      "content": " We lost John McCain nearly a year ago. I worked with Senator McCain during the last 14 months of his life. I was a newcomer to his staff and our time together was short. I am nevertheless certain that at the end of his service, his greatest frustration was our inability to bring partisan competition back within constructive bounds \u2014 to run tough but honest and substantive campaigns that strengthened American government and made it an example for the world. I am not heartened by what I see of the Democratic campaign to oust President Trump. It is difficult to imagine that Donald Trump will be defeated if the Democratic nominee emerges from the primaries with the party broken into demographic shards. Indeed, a widening rift between accomplished centrists and impatient young progressives augurs a uniquely destructive general election. Democrats must remember: Divisions among their own party\u2019s traditional constituencies helped pave the way for Mr. Trump\u2019s election. A narrow, polemical campaign \u2014 even if successful \u2014 will do the country further, lasting harm if it leaves large numbers of our citizens embittered and estranged. How Mr. Trump might be defeated matters in its own right. Our country is rived for many reasons. Some have little to do with politics or government. But too little thought is given to the damage done, cycle after cycle, as candidates play the odds in pursuit of a slim but sufficient margin. Few can resist the temptation merely to excite their base and damn the rest of us as the cause of all the trouble. America cannot take much more of this. We must have candidates willing to engage the bewildered and polarized American electorate of the early 21st century as it is and to assume responsibility for the whole of it. For many years, both parties have persuaded themselves that they command a hidden majority and that a lasting victory is just an election away. They need only redouble campaign spending, sharpen the invective, promise boldly, and soon they can legislate at will. Never mind the jaw-dropping sacrifices of comity and political substance such tactics entail. The end will justify the means. A few months ago, against the background of the past two years, and despite the equivocal impact of the Mueller investigation, Democrats could be forgiven for assuming that the outcome of the coming presidential election would indeed be different. The Trump administration is uniquely disorderly and unethical. Moreover, the president is so bombastic, and so incorrigible when he is wrong, that he is utterly unable to persuade and to lead when he is right. But he has sharpened his game as the ideological turmoil within Democratic ranks has become more apparent. But even if the Democrats win the White House in 2020, the problems that produced the Trump constituency will remain. Behind our foolhardy identity politics stand hard social and economic realities that trouble a majority of our citizens, and the neat trick of blaming Mr. Trump for the circumstances that made his presidency possible is not going to work for very long. I refer to the well-known difficulties American workers face in a globalized economy, problems we share with most postindustrial democracies, such as widening income inequality and the failure of our schools to equip citizens for the unforgiving dynamism of a tech-driven economy and liberalized trade. That these difficulties seem disproportionately to affect white working-class men or rural communities in \u201cred\u201d counties does not mean they are now confined, or will remain confined, to those demographic categories. They are American problems that also affect people of color and other key Democratic constituencies, and they will only intensify as intelligent machines play a greater role in our economic future. A good campaign might also tackle foreign affairs and defense policy (long overdue for Information Age reform) without widening social and cultural fissures. Yes, we are confronted with substantive, thorny conflicts of interest among our people. This cannot be denied. But there are also truly national interests at stake that provide an ample basis for a more unifying politics. The candidate who gets it right might win big \u2014 and set an invaluable, constructive precedent. If, on the other hand, Mr. Trump\u2019s successors refuse to speak to the whole of the country, it is only a matter of time before another irresponsible figure, right or left, will knock together a winning political combination based upon resentment and unrealizable (or irrelevant) aims. The specter here is neither neo-fascism nor green socialism, but demagogy and enfeeblement as it proves impossible to govern this country merely in the interest of ad hoc constituencies. When it comes to running a principled campaign, Senator McCain, in his own actions, was eloquent. At crucial moments in his pursuit of the presidency, he shunned divisive messages that might have helped him win. And when on occasion he did act opportunistically, he regretted it painfully \u2014 and said so. Senator McCain understood that campaigns themselves shape the electorate. A merely reactive politics that plays to existing prejudices is poison. In that sense, especially, his example is relevant to this moment. We truly do need a maverick, for business as usual is tearing the country apart. Mr. Trump has an instinct for divisive campaigning, but it is a widely practiced art, and his departure from the White House \u2014 when it comes \u2014 will not in itself repair the damage. We must demand leadership in place of gamesmanship from all of our candidates.",
