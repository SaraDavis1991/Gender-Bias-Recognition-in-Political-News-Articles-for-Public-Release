The turning point, he says, came when Graham made an alliance with President Eisenhower, and evangelicals began to conflate pollical power and access to Republican leaders with the advancement of God’s kingdom. Kidd describes the Republican efforts to woo evangelicals while President Johnson’s civil rights acts were turning white Southerners against him. Throughout the book, Kidd does a good job of including the perspectives of black clergymen. However, he, like many other evangelicals, often equates “evangelicals” with “Christians,” and negates the role Northern white Catholics and mainline Protestants played in the civil rights movement."

Criswell’s church in Dallas and later to Jerry Falwell Sr.’s church in Lynchburg, Va. The two pastors were fundamentalists, heavily involved with politics and, as a boy, Howe supported the Moral Majority. Later, he had great hopes when George W. Bush was elected. He liked the idea of “compassionate conservatism,” and he also liked the president’s “moral clarity” when, after 9/11, he told America’s allies that they had to be either for the United States or for the terrorists.

For example, some leading evangelicals in the antebellum period banned the Sunday mail in their communities. And often, as in the case of slavery, the temptation to bring their moral convictions into the public square was irresistible. Northern evangelicals argued that slavery was against God’s will, while Southerners cited biblical passages to prove the opposite. “As a general rule,” Kidd writes, “evangelicals have been at their best when using their political sway to defend the weak and oppressed (such as slaves), rather than seeking to impose evangelical practices, ideas or standards of conscience on the public.”"
