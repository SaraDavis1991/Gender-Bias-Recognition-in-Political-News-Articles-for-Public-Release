      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, already facing impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, publicly called on China on Thursday to examine former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as well, an extraordinary request for help from a foreign power that could benefit him in next year\u2019s election. \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House to travel to Florida. His request came just moments after he discussed upcoming trade talks with China and said that \u201cif they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous power.\u201d The president\u2019s call for Chinese intervention means that Mr. Trump and his attorney general have now solicited assistance in discrediting the president\u2019s political opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and, according to one report, Britain. In speaking so publicly on Thursday, a defiant Mr. Trump pushed back against critics who have called such requests an abuse of power, essentially arguing that there was nothing wrong with seeking foreign help to fight corruption. Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has made little effort to hide actions or statements that critics called outrageous violations of norms and standards. And yet because he does them in public, they seem to stir less blowback than if they had been done behind closed doors. Among other things, he repeatedly called on his own Justice Department to investigate his Democratic foes and eventually fired his first attorney general for not protecting him from the Russia investigation. By boldly repeating the action at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump almost appeared to dare House Democrats to impeach him. But he left his own party in an increasingly uncomfortable position. Republican lawmakers largely stayed silent on Thursday, neither criticizing the president\u2019s latest comments nor defending them as they nervously awaited other developments that they worried could change the complexion of the case. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on China came as the first witness was interviewed by House investigators as part of the impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s request for investigations into Mr. Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, and other Democrats during a July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at the same time Mr. Trump was withholding $391 million in American aid. During a daylong, closed interview, Kurt D. Volker, who resigned last week as the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, told House staff members about his interactions with the Ukrainians and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, who has been vigorously lobbying for Ukrainian investigations into Democrats. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Thursday set off a wave of criticism from Democrats, who said he brazenly implicated himself. \u201cWhat Donald Trump just said on the South Lawn of the White House was this election\u2019s equivalent of his infamous \u2018Russia, if you\u2019re listening\u2019 moment from 2016 \u2014 a grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, Mr. Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, said in a statement. Ms. Bedingfield was referring to a news conference during the 2016 campaign when Mr. Trump on camera called on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s email servers. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d he said. The investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III later determined that just hours later Russian hackers made their first effort to break into servers used by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s personal office. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the House Intelligence Committee chairman leading the impeachment inquiry, said the president\u2019s latest comments were further evidence of his betrayal of duty. \u201cThe president of the United States encouraging a foreign nation to interfere and help his campaign by investigating a rival is a fundamental breach of the president\u2019s oath of office,\u201d he told reporters. Mrs. Clinton weighed in as well. \u201cSomeone should inform the president that impeachable offenses committed on national television still count,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. Whether it is impeachable will be decided by the House, which will determine if it amounts to \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d as outlined in the Constitution. Such a conclusion does not require a criminal offense, but some critics have argued that the president\u2019s requests for investigations of rivals violate campaign finance laws barring solicitation of foreign contributions. The Justice Department has not interpreted it that way. In fact, Attorney General William P. Barr himself has been in touch with foreign officials seeking help for an investigation into the origin of Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry to determine if it was generated by an illegitimate \u201choax\u201d undertaken for partisan reasons, as Mr. Trump has contended. But the chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission on Thursday seemed to suggest that Mr. Trump\u2019s statements might cross a legal line. Ellen L. Weintraub, a Democrat who has served on the commission since 2002, reposted a statement she made in June warning candidates that \u201cit is illegal for any person to solicit, accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.\u201d Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover who served as acting attorney general until she was fired by Mr. Trump, said the president behaved as if acting in the light of day would transform corrupt actions into innocent ones. \u201cThe president is trying to hypnotize the American people into believing that it can\u2019t be wrong if he says it out loud,\u201d she said. \u201cThe White House counsel in a case like this would find the nearest window and jump out,\u201d said Robert F. Bauer, who served as President Barack Obama\u2019s top lawyer and supports Mr. Biden. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to defend it. No way. None.\u201d Republicans did not even try on Thursday, and some disaffected colleagues said they should speak out against the president. \u201cHe\u2019s asking foreign governments to interfere in our election,\u201d former Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois, who is waging a long-shot battle for the Republican nomination, wrote on Twitter. \u201cRight out in the open. Because he thinks he can get away with it. He\u2019s unfit. He\u2019s dangerous.\u201d Left to defend himself, Mr. Trump weighed back in Thursday night, asserting he was allowed to seek foreign help. \u201cAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Mr. Trump has insisted that his July conversation with Mr. Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d even after a reconstructed transcript of the call released by the White House showed him imploring the newly inaugurated Ukrainian leader to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d by investigating the Bidens and other Democrats shortly after Mr. Zelensky discussed his need for more American aid to counter Russian aggression. Undaunted by criticism, Mr. Trump repeated that request on Thursday morning. \u201cI would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBecause nobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked.\u201d Even as he seeks investigations by Ukraine and China, the president and Mr. Barr have also solicited help from Australia and Italy to uncover information undermining the origin of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. The Times of London has reported that Mr. Trump sought help from Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, a report that has not been denied by either the White House or the British government. In Ukraine, Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter made $50,000 a month on the board of an energy company. As vice president, his father pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor whose office oversaw investigations into the company\u2019s owner. But by the time the elder Mr. Biden acted, there was no public evidence that the prosecutor was actively pursuing an investigation, and no evidence has emerged that the vice president, who was carrying out Obama administration policy, was motivated by his son\u2019s business interests. In calling for an investigation of American citizens by China, a repressive Communist government with no rule of law, Mr. Trump referred to a business deal Hunter Biden was in that involved a fund drawing investment from the government-owned Bank of China. The fund was announced in late 2013, days after Hunter Biden flew to China aboard Air Force Two with the vice president, who was in the midst of a diplomatic mission. The president said on Thursday that Hunter Biden was not qualified for that business, noting that he had been discharged from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine. \u201cHe got kicked out of the Navy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAll of a sudden he\u2019s getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a payoff.\u201d Mr. Trump said he had not asked President Xi Jinping for assistance. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about because I\u2019m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion came as senior Chinese officials were set to come to Washington next week for another round of trade negotiations. The two countries, locked in a trade war, are hoping to make progress toward a deal after a breakdown in talks in May, leading to an escalation of tariffs. Mr. Biden is not the only candidate in the race with a child with business in China. Mr. Trump\u2019s elder daughter, Ivanka, a senior White House adviser, has received valuable trademarks from China even after she closed her brand in 2018 because of worsening sales and questions of conflicts of interest.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s latest broadside against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter appears to center on a joint venture that involved the younger Mr. Biden and some of China\u2019s leading state-owned financial companies. But the president\u2019s claims bear little if any relation to the known facts. Without presenting any evidence, Mr. Trump suggested on Thursday that China showered $1.5 billion on Hunter Biden in order to influence his father and win favorable trade deals with the United States. \u201cThat\u2019s probably why China for so many years has had a sweetheart deal where China rips off the U.S.A.\u201d because they deal with people like \u201cBiden where they give the son a billion and a half dollars,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. He added: \u201cYou know what they call that? They call that a payoff.\u201d Companies associated with Hunter Biden or his business partners have struck several deals involving China over the past decade. So, in fact, have Mr. Trump\u2019s own relatives \u2014 a point that Mr. Trump does not mention in his now almost-daily accusations against the former vice president, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and his son. But while the extent of Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings with China is not entirely clear, no evidence has emerged of how much money the younger Mr. Biden may have earned. In fact, his lawyer says he has earned nothing from the venture that the president is apparently citing. Nor is there any evidence that his father traded favors with the Chinese government to help his son. Mr. Trump\u2019s latest attacks follow weeks in which he has accused Hunter Biden of improperly profiting in Ukraine from his father\u2019s position. The younger Mr. Biden collected roughly $50,000 a month for serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm at a time when his father was helping to shape the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy toward Ukraine. Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts this past summer to pressure Volodymyr Zelensky, the new Ukrainian president, to investigate Mr. Biden and his son \u2014 at the same time that Mr. Trump was withholding $391 million in American military aid to Ukraine \u2014 set off the fast-moving impeachment inquiry now underway in the House of Representatives. The president\u2019s attacks also come after a string of controversies involving members of Mr. Trump\u2019s extended family and China, most of them unfolding after he was elected. A company run by his daughter Ivanka has been awarded dozens of potentially valuable trademarks by the Chinese government. A real estate company owned by the family of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, tried to sell its troubled investment in a Manhattan skyscraper to a prominent Chinese firm. And Nicole Meyer, Mr. Kushner\u2019s sister and an executive in the family firm, invoked her connections to the president when she pitched Chinese investors in Beijing to buy into a development in New Jersey. The $1.5 billion figure to which Mr. Trump referred on Thursday appears to be the amount of money that a Shanghai-based private-equity company, BHR Equity Investment Fund Management Co., aimed to raise in 2014. The company, which says its biggest shareholder is the state-controlled Bank of China, pools money and invests in companies, many of which are also state owned. Hunter Biden has been a member of the board of BHR since it was formed in late 2013. In October 2017, after his father had left the vice presidency, he bought 10 percent of the firm, investing the equivalent of $420,000. But his lawyer, George Mesires, said on Thursday that he has never been paid for his role on the board, and has not profited financially since he began as a part-owner. \u201cHe has not been compensated for being on the board of directors, nor has he received any return on his investment to date,\u201d Mr. Mesires said. Although BHR has been involved in a number of business deals, he said, \u201cthere have been no distributions to the shareholders since Hunter has been an equity owner.\u201d With his latest attacks on the Bidens, Mr. Trump is \u201cdesperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked and dismissed by independent, credible news organizations,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, Mr. Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, said in a statement. Still, the fact that Chinese state-owned firms were interested in linking arms with Hunter Biden while his father was vice president fits a long pattern of companies owned by or closely tied to foreign governments courting the families of high-ranking American officials. In 2002, for example, when George W. Bush was president, his brother Neil won a $400,000 consulting contract to advise a Chinese semiconductor company co-founded by the son of the man who was then China\u2019s president. \u201cAlmost any senior name that I start researching, I run into practices like this. It is extraordinarily widespread,\u201d Sarah Chayes, the author of the book \u201cThieves of State: Why Corruption Threatens Global Security,\u201d said in an interview on National Public Radio on Thursday. \u201cHow did we all convince ourselves that this isn\u2019t corrupt?\u201d Asked if there was any conflict of interest, Mr. Mesires, said: \u201cHunter has been repeatedly clear on this point. Hunter has not and does not discuss his business interests with his father.\u201d A spokesman for the Biden campaign also said that the former vice president never discussed the China venture with his son. The only known connection between the elder Mr. Biden and BHR came in early December 2013 in Beijing. Mr. Biden, who had traveled to China on official business as vice president, met and shook hands with his son\u2019s business associate, Jonathan Li, in the lobby of the hotel where the American delegation was staying, according to an account in The New Yorker. The magazine said Hunter Biden had arranged the encounter with Mr. Li, who was headed for a post as BHR\u2019s chief executive. Hunter Biden went along to Beijing, too, because his young daughter had been invited and needed to be chaperoned, according to Mr. Mesires. He said that his client and Mr. Li met for coffee on the trip but that it was only a social chat. \u201cHe conducted no business there,\u201d the lawyer said. Several days after the trip, BHR won a business license from the Chinese government. Mr. Mesires said that the registration paperwork had already been submitted and that the timing of the approval was purely coincidental. Hunter Biden was not involved in the firm\u2019s registration, and its approval \u201cwas not related in any way, shape or form to Hunter\u2019s visit,\u201d he said. To raise funds, BHR teamed up with some of China\u2019s leading state-owned financial companies, including its biggest indirect shareholder, Bank of China, as well as China Development Bank and the country\u2019s social security fund, according BHR\u2019s website. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2014 that the firm was seeking to raise $1.5 billion. That figure was then cited by Peter Schweizer, a conservative author, in a 2018 book detailing the China business ties of some prominent American political families. Mr. Schweizer was also the author of the 2015 book \u201cClinton Cash.\u201d Until October 2017, well after his father had stepped down from the vice presidency, Hunter Biden had no equity stake in BHR, Mr. Mesires said. He said Mr. Biden bought a stake in the firm in the name of a company named Skaneateles L.L.C. for the equivalent of about $420,000. That gave him about 10 percent of the company\u2019s registered capital of 30 million renminbi, China\u2019s currency. Skaneateles is the New York hometown of Hunter Biden\u2019s mother, who died in 1972. BHR has invested in a number of state-owned Chinese companies, including a subsidiary of the oil refiner Sinopec and China General Nuclear Power Group. The business focus of some of them is at odds with American policy. For example, the company invested in Face++, a division of the Chinese company Megvii, which specializes in facial recognition technology that is promoted for use by China\u2019s police, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. BHR also invested alongside AVIC, a major state-owned aerospace and defense company that builds fighter jets for the Chinese military.",

      "content": "  MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 A fired-up President Trump lashed out against Democrats at a combative campaign rally on Thursday night, deriding them as \u201cvery sick and deranged people\u201d who were only investigating him for abuse of power in order to \u201cerase your vote.\u201d Facing impeachment in the House, Mr. Trump took his case to his core supporters, arguing that Democrats were trying to overturn the 2016 election because they knew they could not beat him in 2020. He singled out former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as nothing but a toady for President Barack Obama. \u201cHe was only a good vice president because he knew how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass,\u201d Mr. Trump said, a line that drew huge roars of approval from the crowd. In his first campaign rally since Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the formal beginning of an impeachment inquiry last month, Mr. Trump was as raw and rancorous as ever, targeting individual Democrats in highly personal terms that no president has used in public and presenting himself as a victim of a partisan conspiracy. \u201cFrom Day 1, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election,\u201d Mr. Trump told a crowd of about 20,000 at the Target Center in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic cities in the country. \u201cThey want to erase your vote like it never existed; they want to erase your voice, and they want to erase your future.\u201d He fired off insults in rapid succession at F.B.I. agents, lawmakers and journalists who he said were out to get him. \u201cShe\u2019s either really stupid or she\u2019s really lost it \u2014 or maybe there\u2019s a certain dishonesty in there,\u201d he said of Ms. Pelosi. Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, who is one of his favorite targets, is an \u201cAmerica-hating socialist\u201d who married her brother in order to come into the country, he said. (No proof has emerged substantiating the marriage claim.) He went local in targeting the city\u2019s Democratic mayor, Jacob Frey, who drew the president\u2019s ire this week for seeking reimbursement for the cost of extra security required for the rally. \u201cYou got a rotten mayor,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to change your mayor.\u201d But no Democrat came under as much fire as Mr. Biden, one of the leading Democrats bidding to challenge him next year. It was Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to come up with damaging information about Mr. Biden that prompted the House impeachment inquiry that now threatens his presidency. Mr. Trump maintained he was interested only in uncovering supposed corruption by the former vice president and his younger son, Hunter Biden, who made $50,000 a month serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company at the same time his father was working on Ukraine policy for the Obama administration. In scathing terms, Mr. Trump mocked Hunter Biden, who struggled for years with alcohol and drug abuse and was discharged from the Navy Reserve after failing a drug test. Calling him unqualified for the energy company post, Mr. Trump declared that Hunter Biden was \u201cnot too smart\u201d and added, \u201cHunter, you\u2019re a loser.\u201d He noted that Hunter Biden had been out of the public spotlight in the past couple of weeks as the president and his supporters have sought to make him a political liability for the former vice president. \u201cWhatever happened to Hunter?\u201d Mr. Trump demanded. \u201cWhere the hell is he? Where\u2019s Hunter?\u201d Turning to a group of supporters, the president said, \u201cHey, fellas, I have an idea for a new T-shirt.\u201d It should say, \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d he added. Mr. Trump was proudly on offense all night, cheerfully using the word \u201chell\u201d repeatedly while mocking those who say he should watch his language. \u201cI\u2019m energized,\u201d he told the crowd. At another point, he reveled in his ad hoc blasts at his enemies. \u201cIsn\u2019t it much better when I go off script?\u201d he asked. The rally, the first of three in the next week, came on a day of rapidly advancing developments in the impeachment inquiry and related matters. Energy Secretary Rick Perry was subpoenaed on Thursday for records that could shed light on any role he may have played in Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two of associates of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, were indicted on campaign finance charges. And Mr. Trump told reporters that the man just announced as his outside counsel, Trey Gowdy, could not start in that position until January because of \u201clobbying rules,\u201d even as House Democrats hope to have an impeachment vote wrapped up by the holidays. Despite the fast-moving inquiry unfolding in Washington, Mr. Trump showed that he, too, was barreling forward in his re-election campaign, using impeachment as fuel to energize his hard-core supporters while trying to expand the electoral map. This time, his campaign is pouring resources into a state with the hopes of putting Democrats on defense and projecting confidence that they have more paths to re-election than simply recreating the winning map from 2016. Mr. Trump lost Minnesota by 1.5 percentage points to Hillary Clinton in 2016, despite having no campaign staff on the ground and barely setting foot in the state. \u201cWe are going to win this state,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he took the stage Thursday night. \u201cThis feels like the day before the election.\u201d The president\u2019s decision to visit Ms. Omar\u2019s backyard was also a show of confidence, challenging a local congresswoman in her home state. \u201cHow do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota?\u201d he asked the crowd, calling her one of the \u201cbig reasons\u201d that he would win re-election. He bemoaned the fact that so many Somali refugees had been allowed to resettle in Minnesota and boasted that he had closed the door to many foreigners seeking protection in the United States. \u201cI have reduced refugee resettlement by 85 percent,\u201d he said. Outside the Target Center, Trump protesters clashed with Trump supporters, their shouting and cursing escalating as the president took the stage. Many said the longtime Democratic state suddenly felt like a battleground, and strangers approached each other to pick fights. \u201cTell me why you like him,\u201d one man yelled at a nearby Trump supporter. Criticized by another protester for the president\u2019s white supremacist undertones, the Trump supporter replied, \u201cI could have 100 black people with me if I wanted to.\u201d Cameron Russell, 26, of Minneapolis, a donor support technician who is black, voiced his skepticism: \u201cYo, man \u2014 pull them up. Call them up.\u201d Then Mr. Russell recognized the Trump supporter, who is white, as a high school classmate. \u201cI thought you were cool,\u201d Mr. Russell said to him.",

      "content": " On Sept. 24, 2015, Geoffrey Pyatt, then the American ambassador to Ukraine, spoke in Odessa about the scourge of corruption. It was about a year and a half after what is sometimes called the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukrainians overthrew the kleptocratic, Russian-aligned regime of Viktor Yanukovych. The country was trying to move in a more liberal, European direction. Corruption, said Pyatt, threatened to hold the new Ukraine back. Pyatt called out the office of Viktor Shokin, then the prosecutor general of Ukraine. \u201cCorrupt actors within the prosecutor general\u2019s office are making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform,\u201d he said. Pyatt specifically lambasted Shokin\u2019s office for subverting a British case against a man named Mykola Zlochevsky, Yanukovych\u2019s former ecology minister. In 2014, as part of a money-laundering investigation, British authorities froze $23 million Zlochevsky had in London. They requested supporting documentation from Shokin\u2019s office. Instead, it intervened on Zlochevsky\u2019s behalf. \u201cAs a result the money was freed by the U.K. court and shortly thereafter the money was moved to Cyprus,\u201d said Pyatt. \u201cShokin was seen as a single point of failure clogging up the system and blocking corruption cases,\u201d a former official in Barack Obama\u2019s administration told me. Vice President Joe Biden eventually took the lead in calling for Shokin\u2019s ouster. As all this was happening, Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, sat on the board of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company that Zlochevsky co-founded, at some points earning $50,000 a month. Zlochevsky might have thought he could ingratiate himself with the Obama administration by buying an association with the vice president. All available evidence suggests he was wrong. Turning this history on its head, Trump has accused Joe Biden of coercing Ukraine to jettison Shokin in order to protect Hunter. He has pressured Ukraine\u2019s current president to open an investigation into the Bidens, which would make Trump\u2019s charges seem more credible. As the president faces impeachment, his surrogates are parroting his attack on Biden, and his campaign is reportedly spending a staggering $10 million on an ad to amplify the smear. Journalists, perhaps seeking to appear balanced, have sometimes described Trump\u2019s claims about Biden as \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d or \u201cunsupported.\u201d That is misleading, because it suggests more muddiness in the factual record than actually exists. Trump isn\u2019t making unproven charges against Biden. He is blatantly lying about him. He and his defenders are spreading a conspiracy theory that is the precise opposite of the truth. [Listen to \u201cThe Argument\u201d podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Like most effective conspiracy theories, this one is built around a speck of something real. Hunter Biden\u2019s place on Burisma\u2019s board was untoward, even if it\u2019s preposterous for Trump to complain about nepotistic corruption. Biden\u2019s son doesn\u2019t seem to have broken any laws, but the way he traded on his name was still sleazy. Joe Biden appears to have been uncomfortable with his son\u2019s involvement with Burisma; in a New Yorker profile, Hunter recalled his father saying, \u201cI hope you know what you are doing.\u201d Hunter said they never spoke further about the issue; Biden has made a point of not talking to his son about his business dealings. It\u2019s not hard to imagine why Biden didn\u2019t press Hunter. The Biden boys and their father had been through hell together. Hunter has said his first memory was waking up in the hospital next to his older brother, Beau, after the car crash that killed their mother and baby sister. He grew up to be a troubled man, his life pockmarked by addiction and failure. Beau died of brain cancer a few months before Biden traveled to Ukraine to push the government to crack down on corruption. It\u2019s not shocking that, at a moment when his family was consumed by grief, Biden wasn\u2019t inclined to confront his surviving son. But even if you\u2019re not inclined to empathize with Biden \u2014 even if you assume the worst about him \u2014 Trump\u2019s conspiracy theory makes no sense. To believe it, you\u2019d have to first believe that the foreign affairs apparatus of the Obama administration was willing to put its credibility on the line in service of the black sheep of the Biden family. After all, Joe Biden wasn\u2019t freelancing in Ukraine; he was carrying out White House policy. Further, if the Trump administration truly believes that Obama\u2019s Ukraine policy was crooked, one might ask why it has Pyatt, who helped accomplish that policy, representing America as ambassador to Greece. Most important, getting rid of Shokin made an investigation of Burisma more likely, not less. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to investigate Burisma,\u201d the Ukrainian anti-corruption activist Daria Kaleniuk told The Washington Post. \u201cShokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.\u201d However bad the optics around Hunter Biden, Joe Biden was not serving his son\u2019s interests. If anything, they were working at cross-purposes. As I\u2019ve written multiple times, I don\u2019t want Biden to be the Democratic nominee. There\u2019s much in his legislative record that troubles me, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s as electable as his champions claim. In some ways, my preferred political outcome would be advanced if Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal ends up tarring Biden as well. But Trump\u2019s weaponized disinformation is corrosive to democracy no matter whom it targets. Like many authoritarians, he depends on getting people to accept a big lie or to give up on the idea of truth altogether. If he succeeds in defaming Biden today, he\u2019ll be even more audacious in using the same strategy against anyone else who threatens him. What\u2019s at stake isn\u2019t just Biden\u2019s political future. It\u2019s how much Trump can erode the political salience of reality, and how much the media helps him.",

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": "  Here\u2019s our rundown of what happened in the Democratic primary this week, as the candidates gear up for Tuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. explicitly endorsed impeachment on Wednesday, going beyond past statements in which he had called only for an impeachment inquiry if President Trump did not cooperate with Congress. \u201cTo preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\u201d Mr. Biden told supporters in New Hampshire, as he accused Mr. Trump of having \u201cbetrayed this nation.\u201d It\u2019s been a whirlwind week for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is recovering from a heart attack. In addition to the concerns the episode raised about his health, his campaign\u2019s delay in disclosing the heart attack led to criticism about its transparency, which Mr. Sanders has forcefully rejected. Perhaps more consequentially, Mr. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that he would be changing the \u201cnature\u201d of his campaign by doing fewer events. On Wednesday, he said he had misspoken. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts often tells voters that after she became \u201cvisibly pregnant\u201d at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, the principal wished her luck and hired someone else to replace her. This week, a conservative news site and other outlets challenged her account, citing a 2007 interview with Ms. Warren and minutes from a school board meeting \u2014 and Ms. Warren pushed back in a unique way. Rather than just restating the truth of her account (though she has done that as well), she called on women to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination, which remains widespread. CNN and the Human Rights Campaign hosted the latest subject-based forum of the presidential race on Thursday, focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. Protesters interrupted the event at several points to call attention to the murders of black transgender women, and the candidates seemed to welcome the reminder. Before the event, Ms. Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Kamala Harris of California released plans on L.G.B.T.Q. equality. All three said they would fight to pass the Equality Act and ban conversion therapy as president. This week brought a deluge of new policy proposals on issues ranging from foster care to judicial ethics. The fifth presidential debate will be held in Georgia on Wednesday, Nov. 20, and the hosts will be MSNBC and The Washington Post. As previously announced, candidates will need 165,000 donors and at least 3 percent support in four qualifying polls to make the stage. (An alternative polling option is 5 percent support in two early-state polls.) Eight candidates have met those criteria so far; the latest was Andrew Yang, who did so this past week. Ms. Warren had a crowd-pleasing comeback at the CNN town hall when asked how she would respond to a supporter who said, \u201cSenator, I\u2019m old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d Read more about the moment here.",

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s presidential campaign was under attack, and he and his advisers were torn over what to do. For more than a week, President Trump had been hurling unfounded accusations about Mr. Biden, his son Hunter and their dealings in Ukraine. Mr. Biden and his advisers debated whether to mount a fierce counterattack or to stick to a set of policy arguments he had been planning to roll out. Bad news loomed in the background: Mr. Biden\u2019s poll numbers had already grown wobbly, his fund-raising was uneven, and cable news was flashing chyrons by the hour showing Mr. Trump\u2019s wild claims. Mr. Biden himself was equivocating: He wanted to defend and protect his son, but he also believed the president was baiting him into a dirty fight. And as a lifelong adherent to congressional tradition, Mr. Biden was wary of acting hastily as an impeachment inquiry was getting underway. The strain grew so acute that some of Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers lashed out at their own party, taking the unusual step of urging campaign surrogates to criticize the Democratic National Committee \u2014 a neutral body in the primary \u2014 for not doing more to defend Mr. Biden, while the Republican National Committee was running TV ads attacking him. Frustrated, D.N.C. officials informed the Biden camp that it would continue denouncing Mr. Trump but would not run ads for Mr. Biden or any other candidate. The Biden campaign\u2019s tense deliberations reached a climax last weekend when Mr. Biden agreed to give a scorching rebuttal to Mr. Trump in a speech on Wednesday in Reno, Nev. But he delivered it well into the evening on the East Coast, and it was mostly lost amid another long day of Trumpian eruptions. To some Biden allies, it seemed too little too late: a case study in political indecision. Now Mr. Biden looks more vulnerable than at any point since he entered the campaign. Facing one of the greatest challenges of his candidacy, Mr. Biden has plainly struggled to meet the moment, or fully reconcile his own cautious instincts with his protectiveness of his family\u2019s privacy and his preference for taking the moral high road against Mr. Trump. Interviews with more than 50 Democratic strategists, lawmakers and lobbyists provide a portrait of a candidacy facing challenges on all sides, and one at risk of losing its core argument that Mr. Biden is the Democrat best able to defeat Mr. Trump in a general election. There is no evidence behind Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that Mr. Biden intervened inappropriately with Ukraine to help his son, but Democrats have been unnerved by the president\u2019s onslaught and Mr. Biden\u2019s halting response.  In addition to the attacks from Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden\u2019s top rivals, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, each out-raised him in the third quarter by about $10 million. And as Ms. Warren has emerged as Mr. Biden\u2019s most formidable competition, Mr. Sanders, her main challenger for progressive support, just had  a heart attack, casting uncertainty over whether he could siphon votes from Ms. Warren, as the Biden camp had hoped. Even before last week, Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers were acknowledging to donors that he may well lose both of the leadoff nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. His communications aides contend that most voters were more focused on what Mr. Trump did to prompt the impeachment inquiry than on the false claims themselves. And they pointed to the former vice president\u2019s forceful attacks on Mr. Trump at a news conference Friday to argue that he was now ready to do battle with the president. \u201cThis guy like all bullies is a coward,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cHe does not want to run against me.\u201d On Thursday, Mr. Biden, whose inner monologue rarely remains repressed, gave voice to the tension he is struggling with as he spoke at a fund-raiser in Palo Alto, Calif. Recalling the difficulty Hillary Clinton had in confronting Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign style, Mr. Biden worried about being \u201csucked into the trap of the stuff that Trump was laying. He wants you in a mud fight.\u201d \u201cBut when you respond to that,\u201d he continued, \u201cit brings you back down into that.\u201d Mr. Biden was even blunter, and angrier, in private after news first emerged that Mr. Trump had exhorted the Ukrainian government to investigate him and his son. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this guy is going after my family like this,\u201d he told Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, as the two campaigned in Iowa, Mr. Coons recalled. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Leading Democrats have been pleading privately with Mr. Biden and his top aides to aggressively confront Mr. Trump, and expressing impatience with them for not seizing this opportunity to engage him in a two-man race. After all, Mr. Biden had spent months framing his candidacy as a singular crusade to oust an aberrant president. \u201cIt\u2019s time to really respond so everybody hears it,\u201d said Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a campaign co-chairman. \u201cIf someone says something enough, people will start to believe it, and this president gets in his zone of telling a lie over and over again. You have to make sure people don\u2019t believe in it.\u201d David Plouffe, former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign manager, was mystified. Mr. Biden \u201cshould use this moment and become Trump\u2019s opponent,\u201d Mr. Plouffe said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it.\u201d But Mr. Biden is confronting an almost unimaginable situation: the president he hopes to challenge is facing impeachment for urging another country to help smear him. What\u2019s more, the House inquiry centers on what Mr. Biden values most in his private and public life: protecting his family and honoring institutional norms. Several Democrats close to Mr. Biden say he did not take on Mr. Trump sooner in large part because of his reverence for congressional prerogatives \u2014 he did not want to immediately insert himself into the House\u2019s jurisdiction. But Mr. Biden also sought to address the attacks on his son on his own terms rather than sit for hastily arranged television interviews that would have forced him to answer questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s work that few of his own aides dared pose. Now, just as his monthslong lead in the primary is eroding, he faces an opponent who\u2019s threatening his son, the political system he dedicated his adult life to and, as he approaches his 77th birthday, his last chance to become president. For Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, no attack could have been more difficult to deal with than one involving the candidate\u2019s son. Mr. Biden nearly did not run for president because of the effect it would have on his family \u2014 and particularly on Hunter Biden and his children, according to multiple advisers to the former vice president. Hunter Biden has struggled for years with substance addiction and had recently gone through a very public divorce from his first wife. In separate interviews, Mr. Coons and his fellow senator from Delaware, Tom Carper, both said they had warned Mr. Biden that the president would target his family. \u201cHe expected his family to be attacked,\u201d Mr. Carper said, adding that Mr. Biden assured him he was braced for \u201cthe onslaught.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Biden\u2019s family, including his son, encouraged him to enter the race, knowing the attacks were inevitable. But as Anita Dunn, one of Mr. Biden\u2019s closest advisers, put it: \u201cWhen it happens, it still feels pretty lousy.\u201d The Biden campaign has attempted to handle the candidate\u2019s son with great sensitivity. Mr. Biden made clear at the outset that Hunter, a lawyer who had long advised his father on his campaigns, should not be made to feel excluded, people who spoke with him said. One adviser to Mr. Biden recently telephoned his son to solicit advice on the upcoming debate in Ohio. But to most of Mr. Biden\u2019s aides, Hunter Biden has been a spectral presence. He is living in Los Angeles and stayed away from Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign launch in Philadelphia. Hunter Biden quietly attended the last two debates and appeared with his new wife, Melissa Cohen, at a July fund-raiser in Pasadena, Calif. Still, Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers are aware that Hunter Biden carries political vulnerabilities. His business career has intersected repeatedly with his father\u2019s political power, through roles he had held in banking, lobbying and international finance. Working for a Ukrainian energy company beginning in 2014, he was paid as much as $50,000 a month while his father was vice president, and some of Mr. Biden\u2019s admirers worry that, while Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations are without merit, voters may view Hunter Biden\u2019s actions as problematic. Even one of Mr. Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals, Beto O\u2019Rourke, said on Saturday that he would not allow \u201canyone in my cabinet to have a family member to work in a position like that.\u201d In the past, Mr. Biden has bristled at questions about whether his family had benefited financially from his political career. He did so again on Friday when he was asked whether his son\u2019s work in Ukraine represented a conflict of interest. Pointing a finger at the questioner he said: \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he\u2019s doing, that no president has ever done. No president!\u201d The Trump campaign was soon circulating a clip of the episode. For his allies, it is both poignant and painful that Mr. Biden\u2019s family is again at the heart of his public identity. He lost his first wife and daughter, and nearly lost his two sons, in a car accident in the weeks after he was elected to the Senate in 1972. His final years as vice president, as well as his hopes to run for president in 2016, were overwhelmed by his elder son Beau\u2019s death from brain cancer. Jim Mowrer, a former Democratic congressional candidate from Iowa who served with Beau Biden in the military, said he spoke to Hunter Biden early this year and got the impression he was trying to focus on personal matters rather than the campaign. Mr. Mowrer said he saw the elder Mr. Biden in Iowa last month and they discussed not Hunter but his other son, Beau. \u201cBeau\u2019s death is very, very fresh in his mind, and so now these attacks on Hunter are even more unsettling,\u201d Mr. Mowrer said. The politics of Ukraine and impeachment have been so costly for Mr. Biden, in part, because he is confronting so many other challenges in the Democratic race: a struggle to excite liberal primary voters, an ascendant rival in Ms. Warren and a decline in fund-raising that has forced him to spend even more time appealing to donors in cities hundreds of miles from the early primary states. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, acknowledged some of those problems in a briefing for Democratic donors at Morgan Stanley\u2019s New York office last month. Mr. Schultz assured the group that they had a path to the nomination that depended on winning South Carolina \u2014 the fourth primary state \u2014 and then scoring big victories in the Super Tuesday primaries in March. In South Carolina, where Mr. Biden\u2019s support appears strongest among the early-voting states, some of his supporters are discussing a trip to Iowa before Thanksgiving \u2014 to vouch for the former vice president, and to emphasize his ability to appeal to minority constituencies, like African-Americans. \u201cWe probably know Joe Biden a lot better than they do,\u201d said State Senator Dick Harpootlian of South Carolina, a Biden supporter. Mr. Schultz acknowledged at the briefing that Mr. Biden had been uneven at times during debates and on the stump. Still, he predicted Mr. Biden would maintain an advantage over Ms. Warren, saying she would struggle to overcome the persistent competition on the left from Mr. Sanders. But Ms. Warren has recently pulled well ahead of Mr. Sanders. Now, even Mr. Biden\u2019s own campaign aides privately acknowledge that South Carolina may not be much of a political firewall if Ms. Warren rolls through Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. As he finds his way forward, Mr. Biden is relying on a circle of advisers, some formal and others less so, but there is no chief strategist. Mike Donilon, who wrote much of the Reno speech, may be the closest person to playing that role. Democrats who know Mr. Biden well say the campaign is mostly in his hands \u2014 and he makes the final calls. While Mr. Biden\u2019s team has done little polling in the race, he is expected to conduct a survey of Iowa Democrats next week on the Ukraine issue ahead of a new advertising push in the state. Mr. Biden has begun to escalate his attacks on the president, and his campaign began airing a commercial hitting back at the president for trying to \u201cpick his opponent and face only the candidates he thinks he can beat.\u201d Still, there is no final consensus, in Mr. Biden\u2019s camp, about how consistently he should confront Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s never gone negative,\u201d said William M. Daley, the former White House chief of staff, who worked on Mr. Biden\u2019s 1988 campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s not him, that\u2019s the charm of Joe.\u201d",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has raised $15.2 million in the past three months, his campaign said Thursday, a drop-off of $7 million from the previous quarter and a sum that falls short of two leading Democratic rivals. Mr. Biden, who began the Democratic presidential primary leading in the polls, has seen his advantage slip, falling behind Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in several recent polls both nationally and in some early-voting primary states, including Iowa and New Hampshire. His total for the third quarter of the year was another sign of unsteadiness. Several of his opponents released their third-quarter totals earlier this week. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has a strong small-dollar fund-raising base, pulled in $25.3 million, his campaign said Tuesday, while Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., reported $19.1 million raised during the last three months. Senator Kamala Harris of California raised $11.6 million. Ms. Warren has not yet announced her third-quarter total. The deadline for presidential candidates to file their reports is Oct. 15. Last quarter, Mr. Biden pulled in $22 million, one of the biggest hauls in the field for that time period, though he still fell behind Mr. Buttigieg for that quarter. Mr. Biden announced his total at a fund-raiser Thursday afternoon in Palo Alto, Calif., and the campaign announced it in a news release shortly afterward. His campaign declined to comment when asked about Mr. Biden\u2019s cash on hand. At the fund-raiser, Mr. Biden appeared to take a veiled shot at the views of some of his more liberal opponents as he cautioned against a \u201csocialist\u201d response to President Trump, according to a news media pool report from the event. Mr. Sanders is a democratic socialist. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to share in the benefits,\u201d Mr. Biden said at the fund-raiser, where tickets were offered for $1,500 and $2,800. \u201cThat\u2019s been broken. You don\u2019t need some radical, radical socialist kind of answer to any of this \u2014 you\u2019ve just got to make capitalism work like it\u2019s supposed to work. We\u2019ve got to save capitalism from this guy.\u201d Ms. Warren identifies as a capitalist, though she has called for more far-reaching progressive policies \u2014 Medicare for all, for example \u2014 than Mr. Biden supports. Even before the $15 million figure was released, the Biden campaign and allies were playing down the significance of the quarterly total. One close Biden supporter pointed out the lack of traction that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have had among the broader electorate, as reflected in polling, and said that if money were all that mattered then Democrats would be nominating the billionaire financier Tom Steyer. Also Thursday, Mr. Biden was asked for his thoughts on selecting a running mate. \u201cLook, if I could just manufacture someone out of the blue, I would very much think it\u2019s important to have a woman, and even a woman of color, or someone of color as vice president,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned something different. Not different. Something else. The single most important thing you have to have as a president is someone you know is ideologically compatible with you, that you in fact share the same fundamental concerns and values.\u201d The Thursday fund-raiser, and the end of the fund-raising quarter, arrived at an uncertain time for Mr. Biden: The House of Representatives is pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump amid revelations that he asked the president of Ukraine to \u201clook into\u201d Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence that as vice president, Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son\u2019s business dealings there, and the news of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions has outraged Democrats and signaled, to some, that the president is concerned about Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy. While Mr. Biden is fiercely protective of his family, the moment has thrust the delicate subject into the national spotlight \u2014 even as the question of how voters will respond remains fluid, and some of Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers and allies privately acknowledge the risks associated with Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on the Bidens. That dynamic did not stop his team from fund-raising off the developments involving Mr. Trump. The day after details of the president\u2019s conversation came to light, the campaign tripled its daily online fund-raising average, Mr. Biden\u2019s team said, though an adviser did not respond when asked last week whether that pace had continued. During the final days of the fund-raising quarter, Mr. Biden spent much of his time at high-dollar fund-raisers, often attending two or even three in one day as he visited wealthy enclaves like Bel Air, Calif., and Park City, Utah. Mr. Biden has been more reliant on high-dollar donors than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary: Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off big-money fund-raisers. At a fund-raiser in Los Angeles last Thursday, Mr. Biden told attendees that his campaign was close to landing nearly 670,000 donations from about 350,000 people, with an average donation of $46, according to a media pool report of the event. At the time, it wasn\u2019t clear if those remarks were referring to the third-quarter haul or to a cumulative total. The campaign said Thursday that 98 percent of all donations came from grass-roots donors of $200 or less, and said that 56 percent of donors this quarter were new to the campaign.",

Biden Jr. appeared on a late-night talk show for the first time as a 2020 candidate on Wednesday, using the opportunity to poke fun at \u2014 and dismiss criticism of \u2014 his penchant for verbal stumbles. In an interview on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d Mr. Biden also drew a contrast between his slip-ups and actions undertaken by the Trump administration. \u201cAny gaffe that I have made \u2014 and I\u2019ve made gaffes like every politician I know has \u2014 have been not about the substance,\u201d Mr. Biden told Mr. Colbert. \u201cI don\u2019t get wrong things like, you know, we should lock kids up in cages at the border,\u201d Mr. Biden added later, referring to migrant children who were separated from their families at the southern border under the Trump administration. Mr. Biden was also happy to lean in to the show\u2019s lighter moments. After Mr. Colbert asked whether his occasional misstatements suggested he was \u201cgoing nuts,\u201d Mr. Biden went with the joke. \u201cThe reason I came on the Jimmy Kimmel show was because I\u2019m not,\u201d Mr. Biden said, pretending to mistake Mr. Colbert for another late-night television host. Mr. Biden\u2019s remarks reinforced an argument he has made recently, that misstating details on the campaign trail is in a different league than making bad choices while governing. \u201cThe details are irrelevant in terms of decision-making,\u201d Mr. Biden said in an interview with NPR this week. Mr. Colbert\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d has been welcoming territory for Mr. Biden before. In September 2015, Mr. Colbert encouraged Mr. Biden to seek the presidency during an interview that Mr. Colbert credits in part with helping his show take off. In that interview, Mr. Biden suggested that he wasn\u2019t emotionally ready to pursue a run after the death that year of his son, Beau, from brain cancer. It was an emotional and memorable interview about grappling with grief and loss \u2014 a theme that, four years later, is a defining element of how Mr. Biden connects on the campaign trail as a presidential candidate. \u201cYou have suffered, and yet through your suffering you seem to have made some beautiful things in your life,\u201d Mr. Colbert told him then, asking Mr. Biden about the lessons he would share with others who struggle with loss. \u201cI marvel at the ability of people to absorb hurt and just get back up,\u201d Mr. Biden said. At his campaign events, Mr. Biden frequently draws voters who say they aren\u2019t especially enthusiastic about his campaign vision, but rather are focused on his perceived viability in a general election. He also routinely attracts voters who wait in line to talk with him about their own struggles with illness \u2014 especially with cancer \u2014 and their personal losses. Mr. Biden did a sit-down interview this summer with Anderson Cooper of CNN, where the subject of grief again came up in a personal way, as Mr. Biden noted the death of Mr. Cooper\u2019s brother as they discussed his message to family members of gun violence victims. During Wednesday\u2019s new interview, Mr. Biden quipped that he had decided to run for president because Mr. Colbert had told him to. \u201cIt\u2019s your fault,\u201d he said. But pressed on what made him sure about his decision, Mr. Biden again pointed to the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 \u2014 and President Trump\u2019s reaction to it. \u201cI really do believe that we\u2019re in a place we haven\u2019t been in a long, long time, and the president\u2019s taken us there,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cWe have to restore the soul of this country.\u201d Mr. Colbert also could not help but ask Mr. Biden about his plans for his former boss: Would Mr. Biden appoint Barack Obama to the Supreme Court? \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d do it,\u201d Mr. Biden said, before adding, \u201cHe\u2019s fully qualified.\u201d Mr. Colbert has also interviewed several of Mr. Biden\u2019s rivals this year, including Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren. And to the extent that Mr. Biden has largely skipped the late-night circuit so far, jokes about him have been a fixture from television personalities including Mr. Colbert, who have focused on everything from his uncertain debate performances to his efforts to take on Mr. Trump. \u201cOld men fight! Old men fight! Old men fight!\u201d said Trevor Noah of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d after highlighting a back-and-forth between Mr. Biden, 76, and Mr. Trump, who is now 73. \u201cThis would be hilarious. These two dudes fighting? It\u2019s like, \u2018let\u2019s get ready to stumble.\u2019\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The 30-second video ad released by the Trump campaign last week is grainy, and the narrator\u2019s voice is foreboding. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., it says, offered Ukraine $1 billion in aid if the country pushed out the man investigating a company tied to Mr. Biden\u2019s son. Saying it made false accusations, CNN immediately refused to air the advertisement. [Related: Joe Biden calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment, in speech today.] But Facebook did not, and on Tuesday, the social network rejected a request from Mr. Biden\u2019s presidential campaign to take it down, foreshadowing a continuing fight over misinformation on the service during the 2020 election as well as the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. In a letter to the Biden campaign, Facebook said the ad, which has been viewed five million times on the site, did not violate company policies. Last month, the social network, which has more than two billion users, announced that politicians and their campaigns had nearly free rein over content they post there. Even false statements and misleading content in ads, the company has said, are an important part of the political conversation. \u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,\u201d Facebook\u2019s head of global elections policy, Katie Harbath, wrote in the letter to the Biden campaign. The decision by the company illustrates its executives\u2019 hardened resolve to stay out of the moderation of political speech, despite the use of the social network to spread discord and disinformation in the 2016 presidential campaign. On Tuesday, the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee released a sobering report warning of fresh signs of interference by Russia and other foreign nations in the 2020 election. The company\u2019s position stands in contrast to CNN, which rejected two ads from the Trump campaign last week, including the one the Biden campaign asked Facebook to take down. The cable channel said it rejected the ad because it \u201cmakes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets.\u201d Facebook has been dogged by accusations of censorship by conservative politicians, including President Trump, who argue that the Silicon Valley company gives greater attention to liberal points of views on the social network. But by removing itself as the moderator of political content \u2014 including in paid ads on the site \u2014 Facebook has left itself open another avenue of criticism. In a series of tweets Monday evening, Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination, said Facebook allowed President Trump to spread false information widely, and called on the company to take down the attack ad against Mr. Biden, one of her top rivals. \u201cFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once because they were asleep at the wheel while Russia attacked our democracy \u2014 allowing fake, foreign accounts to run ad campaigns to influence our elections,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote. Facebook declined to comment. The ad the Biden campaign asked Facebook to take down, released by the Trump campaign on Sept. 27, starts with staticky shots of Mr. Biden meeting with Ukrainian officials during his time in the Obama administration. \u201cJoe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company,\u201d a narrator says, using video from an event in which Mr. Biden mentions the money. \u201cBut when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him.\u201d The $1 billion figure was mentioned at an event in 2018 at the Council on Foreign Relations, in which Mr. Biden was talking about how the Obama administration tried to root out corruption in Ukraine. He said he had held back financial aid to push the country to make reforms. There is no evidence that Mr. Biden, during his time as vice president, pushed for the dismissal of the Ukrainian prosecutor general to help his son Hunter Biden. The former vice president, along with other members of the Obama administration and other international leaders, pushed for the removal of the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, because of accusations that he ignored corruption. Days after the ad was broadcast on television and social networks the Biden campaign wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, asking to reject the ad. The video \u201cspreads false, definitively debunked conspiracy theories regarding Vice President Joe Biden,\u201d Greg Schultz, a Biden campaign manager, wrote to the Facebook leaders. Mr. Schultz wrote that the vice president\u2019s call for a new prosecutor in Ukraine\u2019s investigation of a company was supported by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He included clippings from The Washington Post and Factcheck.org that debunked the claims of Mr. Biden\u2019s motives of squashing the investigation to benefit his son. After CNN rejected the ad last week, Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, said that the ad was \u201centirely accurate and was reviewed by counsel.\u201d \u201cCNN spends all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming,\u201d Mr. Murtaugh wrote in a statement. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019re shielding him from truthful advertising, too.\u201d The Biden campaign also urged Fox News to reject the Trump campaign ad last week. But the cable channel declined to do so, saying that it was \u201cnot in the business of censoring ads from candidates on either sides of the aisle.\u201d The ad has also appeared on YouTube and Twitter. A spokesman for Twitter said on Tuesday that the ad complied with its policies. A YouTube official likewise said the ad complied with its policies. T.J. Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, wrote in an email that \u201cDonald Trump has demonstrated he will continue to subvert our democratic institutions for his own personal gain, but his shortcomings are no excuse for companies like Facebook to refuse to do the right thing.\u201d",

      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": " PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Leading donors for Joseph R. Biden Jr. convened this weekend for their first donor retreat since he announced his candidacy and struck a determined posture as Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign found itself under assault from President Trump, losing its clear front-runner status and lapped in the money chase by multiple Democratic rivals, most notably Senator Elizabeth Warren. Over cocktails on Friday evening and a Saturday spent in a drab hotel conference room, Mr. Biden\u2019s top financiers and fund-raisers received strategy briefings and PowerPoint presentations, and plotted the path forward for the former vice president, who suddenly found himself in fourth place in the money chase. Only hours before the gathering began, the news broke that Ms. Warren, now seen as Mr. Biden\u2019s chief rival, had out-raised him in the last three months by nearly $10 million \u2014 $24.6 million to $15.2 million. He lagged behind Senator Bernie Sanders ($25.3 million) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), too. While some were downbeat about the financial figures, Mr. Biden\u2019s slip in the polls and the onslaught from Mr. Trump, the Biden loyalists described a sense of almost burden and responsibility. If Mr. Biden is to compete financially with the online windfalls of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, several donors said, they believe it would be on the shoulders of the bundlers assembled here. \u201cAll of us realize that Joe Biden does not have the online fund-raising capability of a Warren. Warren has been doing it longer than him. Sanders has been doing it longer than him,\u201d said Dick Harpootlian, a prominent South Carolina supporter who hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden in May. [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium, said there was an urgency in the air. \u201cWe need him to get the nomination because he\u2019s the one who can win,\u201d she said, adding \u201cWe are all going to try to raise every single dollar we can.\u201d Some donors played down the importance of the very currency that had brought them to Philadelphia in the first place for what the campaign called a \u201cfinance committee forum,\u201d questioning, for instance, whether Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders had the other political assets needed to seriously challenge Mr. Biden. In a sign of the attendees\u2019 significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said. The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open his fund-raising events to reporters. The campaign said this event with Mr. Biden\u2019s biggest bundlers was different because no money was actually raised. On Friday afternoon, the donors received a tour of Mr. Biden\u2019s downtown Philadelphia office before decamping to the second floor of The Continental Mid-town, a retro-style bar a few blocks away where they sported shiny \u201cJoe 2020\u201d pins and sipped from an open bar. On Saturday, there were a series of closed-door briefings, with updates from most of Mr. Biden\u2019s top brass, including his campaign manager, Greg Schultz, and former chief of staff as vice president, Steve Ricchetti, about the run-up to the Iowa caucuses through Super Tuesday, including delegate math and digital tactics, according to attendees, who were asked to keep the proceedings private. Multiple attendees said Ms. Warren was, by far, Mr. Biden\u2019s most discussed opponent, with his strategists telling donors they expected her to come under new press scrutiny now that she has risen in the polls. Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, who refuse to hold traditional fund-raisers or coddle members of the contributor class like those gathered in Philadelphia, have raced ahead of Mr. Biden in fund-raising by attracting hundreds of thousands of small donors online. Ms. Warren had 940,000 donations in the last three months; Mr. Sanders had 1.4 million; Mr. Biden, who sharply cut back digital spending in August, has not disclosed his total number of donations. Some contributors played down the significance of money in a race flooded by free news media attention, and for a candidate like Mr. Biden whose reputation has been established after more than a decade in the national spotlight. [Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.] \u201cHow is money working out for Sanders and Mayor Pete?\u201d asked John Morgan, a lawyer and top Biden fund-raiser in Florida who has hosted the former vice president at his home but who did not attend the summit. \u201cJoe has more than plenty.\u201d Donors were also shown Mr. Biden\u2019s latest ads; the campaign had announced a $6 million television and digital ad purchase on Thursday in the four early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The summit comes less than four months before the opening Iowa caucuses. And it comes as Mr. Trump has relentlessly attacked Mr. Biden, soliciting the assistance of foreign nations to investigate him, his son Hunter and his business deals, sparking an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. Donors, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, were on edge about how the impeachment proceedings would play out. Would Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on Mr. Biden end up helping him by making it appear that Mr. Trump fears him? Or would Mr. Trump\u2019s barrage \u2014 including on the airwaves in early states \u2014 and the president\u2019s singular ability to command attention irreparably wound Mr. Biden in the mind of primary voters? \u201cHe\u2019s running a primary campaign and a general at the same time and I think he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d said Sheila Nix, a former chief of staff to Dr. Jill Biden, who attended the forum. \u201cIt\u2019s a little unprecedented having to do both at the same time.\u201d Biden campaign officials  said that they had always expected the primary race to tighten, it was just a matter of who would emerge as their strongest opponent. Still, the reality began to sink in for the assembled donors: Mr. Biden is likely to be outspent in the coming months. Unlike his two leading rivals, Mr. Biden did not disclose a cash-on-hand total. Mr. Sanders had $33.7 million in the bank. Ms. Warren has $25.7 million. Mr. Biden is expected to report only a fraction of that. Even if he had spent zero dollars since July 1 \u2014 and he has spent millions \u2014 his cash on hand would be less than Mr. Sanders\u2019s or Ms. Warren\u2019s. Mr. Biden spent $5 million in both May and June, the most recent months that federal records are available. His staff and campaign costs have only ballooned since then, suggesting he likely spent nearly all, if not more than, the $15.2 million he raised in the last three months. As the race has narrowed to only three candidates polling consistently above single digits \u2014 Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders \u2014 some see an opportunity for Mr. Biden to consolidate a donor class that is typically more moderate than the grass-roots donors powering the Warren and Sanders campaigns. Mr. Buttigieg and Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey have been the chief competitors for bundler loyalty. But Mr. Biden\u2019s uneven performances on the stump and the debates have slowed such movement. During the last debate, a group of Democratic donors gathered for a private event in Manhattan with the strategists James Carville and Paul Begala providing color commentary. When Mr. Biden went on his discursive and meandering answer that invoked a record-player, there were audible groans, and some people threw their arms in the air in frustration, according to an attendee. In an interview, Mr. Carville said Mr. Trump\u2019s recent \u201cobsession\u201d with Mr. Biden made the former vice president\u2019s electability case better than anyone else could. \u201cI think Biden has been given a lifeline here,\u201d Mr. Carville said. \u201cI hope he takes it.\u201d Among the ads attendees were shown was a new one from Friday in which Mr. Biden accused Mr. Trump of trying to \u201cchoose the Democratic candidate.\u201d For all the incoming Mr. Biden has taken \u2014 from his rivals, from the White House and from, as his campaign likes to point out, the news media \u2014 his advisers believe his continued perch atop many polls proves his resilience, no matter his shrinking lead. \u201cI always come away from things with him thinking I\u2019ve got to work harder. I need to do more,\u201d Ms. Bauer said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t ask for that. He inspires that.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When Michaelyn Mankel approached Joseph R. Biden Jr. at an Iowa steak fry last month to demand dramatic action on climate change, the former vice president clasped the 24-year-old\u2019s hands and assured her, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a better deal from me than anybody.\u201d He did, after all, introduce the very first climate change legislation in Congress, in 1986, before Ms. Mankel was born. He also helped to orchestrate the \u201cgreen jobs\u201d strategy under the Obama administration\u2019s economic stimulus package. He supported landmark regulations on coal plants and automobile tailpipe emissions as vice president, and helped to secure the Paris Agreement, the 2015 pact to limit the rise of global temperatures. His climate change plan would spend $1.7 trillion over a decade, impose a tax on greenhouse gases and aim to bring carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Yet Ms. Mankel, a full-time volunteer for the youth-led Sunrise Movement, was disappointed. \u201cThis far along in his campaign, it seems he is still ill-prepared to answer a serious question about the climate crisis,\u201d she said in an interview. And so it has gone for Mr. Biden, whose experience in the wars over climate change is unmatched among Democratic contenders for the White House, but whose image remains soporific to the young activists driving the debate. \u201cTimes have changed,\u201d said Nigel Purvis, a State Department climate negotiator under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, who called Mr. Biden \u201ca consistent and reliable climate champion\u201d in the Senate and for the White House. But, he added, \u201cLike most longtime Democratic politicians, Biden has a twenty-year track record of advocating for incremental measures, and today the Democratic primary base wants dramatic action.\u201d A new poll made public Tuesday indicated that Mr. Biden remained the front-runner among Democrats and those who count themselves as \u201cclimate voters.\u201d But other candidates, like Elizabeth Warren, are fast closing in. Meantime, the former vice president keeps being accosted on live television and at campaign events by young activists challenging his commitment and his perceived coziness with fossil fuel interests. It is true that Mr. Biden\u2019s climate plan is neither the priciest nor the most ambitious \u2014 others call for reaching carbon neutrality well before midcentury. His refusal to endorse calls for a ban on hydraulic fracturing, a natural-gas extraction method commonly called fracking, may be politically pragmatic as he courts voters in Pennsylvania and Ohio, but it is not popular with activists. Beyond the policy specifics is the sense that Mr. Biden, 76, is simply not the man of the moment. To young climate activists, his campaign has, so far, failed to capture the urgency outlined by a high-profile United Nations report that warned the Earth was on track to experience fatal heat waves and food shortages by 2040, sooner than earlier projections. On a personal level, the candidate can\u2019t quite connect with an incensed climate movement personified by Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish activist who angrily chastised world leaders gathered at the United Nations last month, saying, \u201cIf you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s supporters seem incredulous that his record and proposals have not won young voters over. \u201cThis is a guy who was introducing bills on climate change before this was on the radar screen of most politicians,\u201d said Jake Sullivan, who served as Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser in the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody who talks about the issue in an incredibly passionate and purposeful way.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign challenged the belief among many younger activists that the former vice president is not likely to make climate change a top priority if elected. \u201cThere are some folks in the climate movement who are very vocal,\u201d said Stef Feldman, Mr. Biden\u2019s policy director. \u201cThere are also folks who are believers in the drastic efforts that we need to do to combat climate change who think Joe Biden is the best one equipped to address the challenge, because he has the experience of bringing other countries to the table.\u201d But other issues keep drowning out that message. Questions about Mr. Biden\u2019s ability to energize voters on climate change come as national political attention is focused on accusations that President Trump put pressure on the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who once sat on the board of a Ukrainian company, Burisma.  (Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations of corruption on the part of the Bidens, no evidence has surfaced that the former vice president knowingly took any steps to help his son or the company.) Trump supporters might focus on Hunter Biden\u2019s monthly salary, as much as $50,000. Climate activists are more concerned about Burisma\u2019s business: natural gas. Fossil fuels and Mr. Biden\u2019s support for them are at the heart of the climate movement\u2019s concerns. Three other Democratic contenders \u2014 Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 have called for a national ban on fracking. Mr. Biden has not. (Experts have noted that an outright ban on fracking across the United States would require an act of Congress and could not be done by executive action. However, there are regulatory steps a president could take to limit the practice.) Heather Zichal, an informal adviser to Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign who helped write domestic climate change policies in the Obama administration, served until recently on the board of Cheniere Energy, a liquefied natural gas export company. In September, Mr. Biden attended a fund-raiser hosted by Andrew Goldman, co-founder of another natural gas company, Western LNG. Isaac Larkin, a 27-year-old biologist, asked Mr. Biden about that fund-raiser during a forum on climate change on CNN last month and accused the candidate of violating a pledge not to accept money from fossil fuel executives. Mr. Biden responded that Mr. Goldman did not meet that definition because he was no longer involved with the day-to-day operations of the company and did not sit on the board. Mr. Larkin, in an interview, criticized \u201cBiden\u2019s attempt to clip hairs about who is or isn\u2019t technically a fossil fuel executive.\u201d He also took issue with the position of the Obama administration that natural gas is an important \u201cbridge fuel\u201d to transition from coal to renewable sources like wind and solar. \u201cThe bridge is on fire and we need to get off the bridge and get to a new place immediately,\u201d Mr. Larkin said. Ms. Feldman noted that the former vice president has called for banning oil and gas drilling on public lands. She also said that even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists convened by the United Nations to guide world leaders in policymaking, has acknowledged a role for natural gas as a way to reduce emissions from coal plants. Of course, no Democratic plan has a chance without the White House, and no Democrat will win the presidency without swing states where the fossil fuel industry employs thousands, such as Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump won by less than 1 percentage point. Mr. Biden was born in Scranton, Pa. Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, said it was possible for a candidate who opposes fracking to win Pennsylvania, but he said that was not Mr. Biden\u2019s style. \u201cHis approach is staying close to the middle, giving enough strength on environmental issues to show he\u2019s a vast improvement over the president and hope that does the trick,\u201d Mr. Borick said. \u201cThat\u2019s consummate Biden.\u201d That style rubs young voters like Ms. Mankel the wrong way. She acknowledged that she was unfamiliar with most of the Obama administration\u2019s signature regulations to rein in greenhouse gases. She said she was sure they were ambitious compared to what came before. \u201cBut frankly,\u201d she added, \u201cthey weren\u2019t enough.\u201d",

      "content": " ROCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday called for President Trump\u2019s impeachment for the first time, blistering Mr. Trump as a threat to American democracy and accusing him of \u201cshooting holes in the Constitution.\u201d Escalating his language in an effort to rebut Mr. Trump\u2019s unfounded claims about his actions with Ukraine, Mr. Biden set aside months of restraint to demand Congress move against the president. \u201cTo preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\u201d the former vice president told supporters here, accusing Mr. Trump of having \u201cbetrayed this nation.\u201d Mr. Biden even linked Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims to the so-called Big Lie idea promulgated by the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. \u201cYou say it long enough, often enough, people may believe it,\u201d he said, invoking Goebbels by name. While Mr. Biden stopped short of calling for Mr. Trump\u2019s removal from office, his new aggressiveness marked an acknowledgment that he must do more to both confront a president who is attacking him daily and to halt his slide in the polls in the Democratic primary. The former vice president has openly wrestled with how forceful to be with Mr. Trump, lamenting last week that the president wants to drag opponents into \u201ca mud fight.\u201d But Mr. Biden is increasingly sharpening his rhetoric under pressure from allies to embrace the head-to-head race. Mr. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the House because of his request to the Ukrainian government that it look into what Mr. Biden did with the country when his son, Hunter Biden, was working for a gas company there. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden again denied that he did anything improper as vice president. And he accused Mr. Trump, who has accused Mr. Biden of corruption and whose campaign is airing ads repeating the same claim, of acting entirely out of a desire to undermine his candidacy. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let Donald Trump pick the Democratic nominee for president, period,\u201d said Mr. Biden, who has fallen behind Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in a series of national and early nominating state polls. \u201cHe\u2019s picked a fight with the wrong guy.\u201d The president apparently watched the speech, or was told of it, because even before it was over he noted on Twitter that Mr. Biden had called for his impeachment and claimed the Bidens had \u201cripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars.\u201d \u201cJoe\u2019s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!\u201d wrote Mr. Trump. There is no evidence that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from his overseas work or that his father intervened inappropriately with Ukraine or China, the other country Mr. Trump was alluding to in his tweet. The president has also urged China to look into the Bidens. Mr. Biden again denied that he did anything improper as vice president. He noted that his 2016 call to fire Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, was part of United States government policy under President Barack Obama. It also reflected the wishes of a group of Republican senators at the time, who sought Mr. Shokin\u2019s ouster because he was seen as unwilling to target corruption, Mr. Biden said. A longtime senator before he became vice president, Mr. Biden is deferential to congressional prerogatives and has resisted calling for impeachment, even as Ms. Warren and many of his other Democratic rivals have been outspoken in demanding it. Last month, when House Democrats began moving toward an impeachment inquiry, he said they should only do so if Mr. Trump did not cooperate with their investigation. Then last week he said he would let Congress \u201cdo its job on impeachment.\u201d And at a later event on Wednesday, in Manchester, N.H., he nodded to his longstanding discomfort with impeachment, calling it \u201ca God-awful thing for a nation to go through.\u201d But as Mr. Trump and his allies wage near-daily political warfare against Mr. Biden, he has sought to mount a counteroffensive. He began his rebuttal in a speech last week in Reno, Nev., but on Wednesday he went even further. Speaking from a teleprompter and dressed formally in suit and tie, he used his first trip back to New Hampshire since the impeachment investigation got underway to both taunt and condemn Mr. Trump in remarkably stark language. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid about just how badly I will beat him next November,\u201d said Mr. Biden, attempting to frame the general election as a contest between him and the president, and appealing to Democratic voters here and elsewhere who are consumed with finding a nominee who can oust Mr. Trump. But he also used his speech, which lasted just under 30 minutes, to warn of the damage he claimed Mr. Trump was doing to the country. \u201cWe all laughed when he said could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it,\u201d said Mr. Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s no joke. He\u2019s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.\u201d He argued that impeachment was crucial not just because of what the president had done but also in trying to curb Mr. Trump from committing additional abuses in office. For Mr. Biden, the question now is how to balance countering Mr. Trump\u2019s onslaught with articulating his own policy vision and contrasting himself with his Democratic opponents. He sought to do all three in his appearance in Manchester, reciting many of his same lines about Mr. Trump at the outset of his speech before turning to his record on gun control and domestic violence prevention. \u201cIt takes a proven ability to get things done,\u2019\u2019 he said. And, he reminded the audience in an unmistakable reference to Ms. Warren\u2019s raft of policy plans, \u201cWe\u2019re not electing a planner.\u201d",

      "content": " ALTOONA, Iowa \u2014 Hunter Biden, whose overseas business dealings have drawn relentless attacks from President Trump and posed a threat to the candidacy of his father, Joseph R. Biden Jr.,  intends to step down from the board of a Chinese company, BHR, by the end of the month, his lawyer said on Sunday, a move his father later lauded in a forceful defense of his son\u2019s integrity. The lawyer  also said in a statement that if Mr. Biden were to be elected president, his son would \u201cagree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies.\u201d The decision is the first action the pro-Biden camp has taken that appears to acknowledge the extent to which Hunter Biden\u2019s business practices have created an untenable problem for his father\u2019s 2020 campaign. With the fourth Democratic primary debate only two days away, political strategists said Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to leave the Chinese company could help defuse the issue at a time when Mr. Biden\u2019s lower-polling Democratic rivals have suggested his son\u2019s work overseas raises questions about conflict of interest. \u201cHunter\u2019s decision won\u2019t stop Trump from spreading debunked conspiracy theories about the past,\u201d said David Axelrod, President Barack Obama\u2019s former chief strategist. \u201cBut it does give Joe Biden an answer he didn\u2019t have about potential conflicts of interest moving forward.\u201d In a brief news conference here Sunday in which he repeatedly pounded the podium, Mr. Biden stressed that the decision to leave the Chinese company\u2019s board had been his son\u2019s alone and suggested he learned of the statement from Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers. He also took what seemed to be veiled swipes at some of Mr. Trump\u2019s children, who have had their own overseas business dealings. \u201cThe statement my son put out today, which I saw when he put it out \u2014 I was told it was going to be put out, I did not consult with him about what\u2019s being put out \u2014 in fact represents the kind of man of integrity he is,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cAnd I can tell you now, if I am your president, next president, I\u2019m going to build on the squeaky-clean transparent environment that we had in the Obama-Biden White House, and no one in my family or associated with me will be involved in any foreign operation whatsoever. Period, end of story.\u201d Minutes later, he appeared to jab more sharply at members of the Trump family, a message that Mr. Biden, a Senate traditionalist who reveres beltway customs and civility, does not typically emphasize. \u201cNo one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they\u2019re a Cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one,\u201d he said twice, smacking the podium each time, \u201chas asserted my son did a single thing wrong.\u201d \u201cNo one,\u201d he said, \u201chas asserted that I have done anything wrong except the lying president. That\u2019s the only thing. That\u2019s the focus.\" There is no evidence Mr. Biden acted improperly to aid his son\u2019s overseas financial dealings in China and Ukraine, as Mr. Trump has asserted. Still, many on the Biden team are gravely concerned about the president\u2019s ability to inflict damage with a barrage of claims that, while baseless, could nevertheless take hold in voters\u2019 views of the race. Some of those claims have been featured  in an expansive pro-Trump advertising campaign. Mr. Biden has consistently ranked as one of the Democratic Party\u2019s leading presidential candidates. But his advantage has slipped in some recent polls, and his fund-raising has lagged his top rivals. Over the last two weeks he has begun to vigorously fight back against Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms; last week, in a fiery address in New Hampshire, he called for the first time for Mr. Trump to be impeached, a view he expanded on when addressing a gathering of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Sunday afternoon. \u201cIt does have an incredibly negative impact on the state of affairs in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish it didn\u2019t get there, but it\u2019s gotten so far now, if you don\u2019t, if you don\u2019t move on it, then what do we say to the rest of the world about who we are? What do you say about opening the gates and saying, \u2018come on in, get involved in our elections?\u2019\u201d The statement on Sunday from Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer, George Mesires, said his client had served only as a member of board of directors of BHR,  an equity investment fund manager, \u201cwhich he joined based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets.\u201d It was an unpaid position. Mr. Mesires has previously said Hunter Biden became an investor in 2017, taking a 10 percent stake in BHR. The statement had been in the works for weeks, one Biden adviser said. Over the past month, Mr. Biden and his team have at times hesitated about how to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks, and some Democratic operatives and voters have wondered why Mr. Biden and his campaign did not respond more swiftly and comprehensively. His campaign didn\u2019t answer several follow-up questions about the younger Mr. Biden\u2019s decision, including about why Hunter Biden didn\u2019t recuse himself earlier. Mr. Trump has directed his broadsides against Hunter Biden as he faces an impeachment inquiry in the House, which was spurred by the president\u2019s entreaties to the government of Ukraine urging the government to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s financial dealings there. Subsequently, Mr. Trump publicly called for China to look into Hunter Biden\u2019s financial dealings in that country. Mr. Trump has said with no evidence that the younger Mr. Biden used political ties to induce China to invest $1.5  billion in a fund he was involved in, an assertion Joseph Biden has denied. Aides say Mr. Biden has been bracing for weeks for questions about his son onstage at Tuesday\u2019s CNN/New York Times debate. His allies and advisers say that any Democrat who broaches the subject is playing into Mr. Trump\u2019s hands and hurting the party\u2019s cause, and some have suggested Mr. Biden is prepared to make that case if he faces skepticism over his son\u2019s Ukraine dealings from either the moderators or rival Democrats. Mr. Biden, said Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a close Biden ally,  is \u201cnot going to be surprised\u201d by any attacks on the debate stage on Tuesday, even highly personal ones. Still, some Democrats say the national focus on Mr. Biden\u2019s family has become a political vulnerability, moving him off his campaign message and forcing him to play defense. \u201cIt becomes a distraction, and that\u2019s what hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016,\u201d said Bret Nilles, the Democratic Party chairman in Linn County, Iowa, alluding to the scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices while she was secretary of state. The Biden campaign\u2019s approach has been to push back firmly on Mr. Trump\u2019s claims through an aggressive media strategy, and to argue that the president is attacking Mr. Biden because he is concerned about running against him in a general election. \u201cThey can also say, for Democrats who are nervous about it, \u2018Hunter\u2019s taken a step to say he won\u2019t be on these boards if the vice president is elected president,\u2019 and they could say, \u2018we\u2019ve addressed it and it\u2019s time to move on,\u2019\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communications director in the 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cThere are these campaign rituals you have to go through when your campaign does hit a perilous patch like this in order to signal to the press you\u2019re handling it right, and to reassure supporters.\u201d Mr. Biden sought to take that tack with reporters Sunday, repeatedly seeking to direct attention back to Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior. Mr. Biden also began his remarks at the union gathering by praising Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., for a morning television appearance where he defended \u201cme and my family against these outrageous, lying ads\u201d from Mr. Trump. The last few weeks have been a challenging time for Mr. Biden, aides and allies have said. The Biden family, which is close-knit, has endured painful losses over the years, including the death in 2015 of Mr. Biden\u2019s elder son Beau Biden;  Hunter Biden is the former vice president\u2019s only surviving son. In the weeks since news broke that Mr. Trump urged the Ukrainians to look into Mr. Biden\u2019s family, he has held only a handful of public events, spending significant time at fund-raisers as the third quarter of the year drew to a close.  He finished the quarter having raised about $10 million less than his two top rivals, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Mr. Biden has also toggled between responding sharply to Mr. Trump and pivoting back to policy, though he has ramped up his criticisms of Mr. Trump forcefully in recent weeks, and is expected to make the president a major focus of his debate appearance on Tuesday, a Biden adviser said.

      "content": " Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox. It\u2019s the one question about impeachment that no Democratic presidential candidate wants to answer head on. Should Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president? In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son\u2019s work and his service as vice president. They\u2019re right: There is no evidence that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from his overseas work or that his father intervened inappropriately with Ukraine or China on his behalf, as President Trump has falsely claimed. But in politics, appearances matter. Just ask Hillary Clinton or Mr. Trump, or for that matter, anyone who has ever run for office. At a moment when a populist, anti-establishment fervor runs through both parties, the image of Hunter Biden doing business in Ukraine and China while his father played a prominent role in American foreign policy could quickly become a political liability \u2014 a fact that clearly concerns Mr. Biden and his team, given their fierce efforts to denounce the story. So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke suggested, albeit mildly, that Hunter Biden\u2019s work posed a problem, telling reporters, \u201cI would not allow a family member, anyone in my cabinet to have a family member, to work in a position like that.\u201d Senator Cory Booker called Mr. Biden \u201ctruly an honorable man\u201d on CNN last week, adding, \u201cThis is in no way can besmirch his character, his honor and his incredible service to this country over decades.\u201d But, he noted, \u201cI just do not think that children of presidents, of vice presidents during an administration should be out there doing that.\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar took a similar position when asked whether she\u2019d be comfortable with the child of her vice president sitting on the board of a foreign company. \u201cI can promise you right now, my own daughter, who\u2019s only 24, does not sit on the board of a foreign company,\u201d she said, also on CNN. \u201cBut that is not the issue. The issue here is what the president is doing.\u201d Much of the rest of field has largely dodged the question. Senator Elizabeth Warren initially said she didn\u2019t know when asked whether her ethics plan would prevent a top official\u2019s child from getting a job with a foreign company. Since then, she\u2019s pivoted back to Mr. Trump when asked similar questions. And Senator Kamala Harris, when asked about the issue, has taken to simply saying: \u201cLeave Joe Biden alone.\u201d In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden\u2019s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback. The questions surrounding his son may be even more sensitive: Democratic voters generally feel warmly toward \u201cUncle Joe,\u201d particularly when it comes to his family, which has been deeply marked by the tragic deaths of his first wife and infant daughter and his elder son, Beau. Echoing an attack introduced and continually leveraged \u2014 in false ways \u2014 by Mr. Trump could risk raising Democrats\u2019 ire. That doesn\u2019t mean the question won\u2019t be asked at the CNN/New York Times debate on Tuesday night. I don\u2019t know what the questions will be, but my bet is on the topic coming up (Marc Lacey, if you\u2019re listening\u2026). Whether a candidate takes the gamble will be interesting to watch.

My colleague Jennifer Medina wrote this week about Juli\u00e1n Castro, his activist mother and the political power of third-generation immigrants. She dug into the demographics for us. Who is an American? It\u2019s a question that\u2019s just beneath the surface of many debates over race and immigration. In dozens of conversations with Latinos whose families have lived in the United States for generations, there was one sentiment they nearly all shared: They suddenly felt their own Americanness was being called into question. The idea of a perpetual foreignness is hardly new. Mexican-Americans have been fighting that perception for generations, as Rosie Castro, the Chicana activist and mother of Juli\u00e1n Castro, the only Latino running for president, recently told me. Just how many Latinos come from families who have lived in the United States for at least three generations? Demographers at the Pew Research Center put the figure at 17 million, roughly 30 percent of the Latino population over all. That percentage has remained steady over the last several years, while the percentage of foreign-born Latinos dropped to below 50 percent in 2013, and is now at 48 percent. For years, many political leaders like Mr. Castro saw the power of Latinos increasing, but the Trump era has made clear how elusive that power might be. So, now, they are directly discussing race and embracing the kind of rhetoric they once shied away from \u2014 the kind their second-generation parents used in the 1960s.

      "author": "Peter Schweizer",
      "content": " In 2016, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $264 million as part of a settlement with the federal government. The reason? An Asian subsidiary of the company had hired the children of Chinese government officials in the hopes of currying favor with their powerful parents \u2014 a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Had the same thing happened with a foreign company and an American politician\u2019s family, however, no violation would have occurred \u2014 because no equivalent American law prevents a foreign company or government from hiring the family members of American politicians. This glaring loophole provides political families with an opportunity to effectively \u201coffshore\u201d corruption and cronyism. It gives the politically connected class enormously tempting opportunities for self-dealing, the sort of thing that is blatantly illegal in almost any other context. Consider two Washington power families: the Bidens and the McConnell-Chaos. As vice president, Joe Biden served as point person on American policy toward China and Ukraine. In both instances, his son Hunter, a businessman, landed deals he was apparently unqualified to score save for one thing: his father. [The big debates, distilled. This guide will put in context what people are saying about the pressing issues of the week. Sign up for our new newsletter, Debatable.] In December 2013, Joe and Hunter Biden flew aboard Air Force Two to China; less than two weeks after the trip, Hunter\u2019s firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners, which he founded with two other businessmen in June 2013, finalized a deal to open a fund, BHR Partners, whose largest shareholder is the government-run Bank of China, even though he had scant background in private equity. (Representatives of the fund claim that the timing of the deal and the Bidens\u2019 trip to China was coincidental.) Thus far, the firm has invested about $2.1 billion, according to its website. In trying to disprove a link between the father\u2019s powerful position and the son\u2019s surprising success, Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers claim he did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after Joe Biden left office. Hunter, whose company, according to its financial records, held an equity stake in the fund, took a board seat when it was founded, in December 2013. At the same time, his business partner, Devon Archer, was vice chairman. With the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, Joe Biden became point person in Ukraine as well. That same year, Hunter Biden landed a board position with the Ukrainian energy giant Burisma Holdings. Despite having no background in energy or Ukraine, the vice president\u2019s son was paid as much as $50,000 a month, according to financial records. (He left the board in early 2019.) Why would someone with so little experience be able to command such enormous payments? Joe Biden recently claimed, \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d But Hunter Biden admitted to The New Yorker that on one occasion, they had in fact discussed his work for Burisma: \u201cDad said, \u2018I hope you know what you are doing,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I do.\u2019\u201d Moreover, a representative for BHR Partners has said that Hunter Biden introduced his father to one of the company\u2019s founders during their December 2013 China trip. The Bidens are hardly alone. President Trump\u2019s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, and her husband, Senator Mitch McConnell, are being accused of having profited from their commercial ties to Beijing. In 2004, the two had a net worth of about $3.1 million, according to public disclosures. Three years later, the range was $3.1 million to $12.7 million. The next year, their net worth rocketed to $7.3 million to $33.1 million. What changed? In 2008, Ms. Chao\u2019s father, James Chao, gave the couple a \u201cgift\u201d of $5 million to $25 million (politicians are required to report money in ranges, not exact amounts). Certainly, their wealth has continued to grow. Mr. Chao\u2019s generosity was made possible by the fortune he has amassed through his shipping company, Foremost Group, which has thrived in large part because of its close ties with the Chinese government. In late 1993, Mr. Chao and his son-in-law, Mr. McConnell, traveled to China as guests of the state-owned shipyard conglomerate and military contractor, China State Shipbuilding Corporation. There they met with an old classmate of Mr. Chao\u2019s, the former Chinese president Jiang Zemin. Mr. McConnell\u2019s once hard-line condemnations of China softened in the years to follow. For example, as The New Republic has noted, Mr. McConnell went from telling University of Louisville students that America would never forget Tiananmen Square, in the late 1980s, to hosting the Chinese ambassador at the same school several years later, even as the ambassador publicly defended the regime\u2019s suppression of the Falun Gong. All along, the Chaos continued to gain influence. Mr. McConnell\u2019s sister-in-law, Angela Chao, and James Chao sat on the board of the holding company for China State Shipbuilding. While Elaine Chao was secretary of labor under George W. Bush, Foremost Group ordered several enormous cargo ships from a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding. Secretary Chao and her father also appeared in several tandem interviews with Chinese media, and in at least one, they sit in front of the Department of Transportation\u2019s emblem and alongside images of a book written by Mr. Chao. Today, Angela Chao sits on the board of the Chinese government\u2019s Bank of China. Last month, the House Oversight and Reform Committee  started an investigation into whether Secretary Chao has leveraged her government positions to benefit her family. But so far there is no investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. Defenders claim there must first be proof that a law was broken to open an investigation. That\u2019s exactly backward. Congress can and should conduct an inquiry to determine whether anything illegal occurred. The problem more broadly is that we rely on a hodgepodge of laws that lack the clarity and bright ethical lines found in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That needs to change. International bribery laws clearly state that if a person or entity pays a politician\u2019s family member and gets favors in return, it\u2019s an act of bribery; it\u2019s no different from the politician taking the money himself. Obviously, the immediate family members of high-ranking politicians have to work \u2014 no one is saying otherwise. But given their unparalleled access, they should also be required to be transparent about what they are doing. At a minimum, we need to strengthen American disclosure rules. Joe Biden and Elaine Chao have to report when someone sends them a $500 campaign donation, or when they make a $5,000 investment in a stock. But when their family members strike lucrative deals with a foreign government or oligarch, the reporting requirements are vague. The personal financial disclosure rules for American public officials should be expanded to include details concerning all their immediate family members (and not just their spouses, as the law currently states), and any dealings with foreign governments. To the public, closing a loophole this glaring seems anodyne, a no-brainer. But lawmakers set the system up this way for a reason; they will not stop the foreign cash influence game voluntarily. That\u2019s why we need a Washington Corrupt Practices Act, one that clearly shuts down foreign influence and self-enrichment for some of America\u2019s most powerful families on both sides of the aisle.",

      "content": "  He tends to meander and misspeak. She once won a college debate scholarship. He is a relative centrist who is seen by Democrats in early polls as the strongest candidate against President Trump. She is a self-styled progressive fighter whose ability to appeal to the broad electorate in a general election still worries some voters and party officials. He rarely delves deep into policy on the campaign trail, preferring to discuss American values and the dangers of a second Trump administration. She gleefully ticks through her long list of detailed plans. In style, substance and strategies for winning the White House, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren present two starkly different options for Democratic voters, and in many ways they embody competing theories about what the Democratic Party should stand for. Those tensions will be laid bare Thursday night in Houston, when the two candidates meet onstage at a debate for the first time in the presidential race. It\u2019s a highly anticipated matchup between the early front-runner, Mr. Biden, and a liberal standard-bearer, Ms. Warren, who has steadily climbed in the polls to challenge him. Mr. Biden is eager to stress his experience. And his advisers and allies suggested in interviews that, whether obliquely or overtly, he is prepared to seize on one of Ms. Warren\u2019s perceived strengths \u2014 her extensive and boldly progressive policy plans \u2014 and use that to accentuate his own record of liberal achievements despite the sometimes-challenging political realities in Washington. \u201cYou have to have plans, but you have to be able to execute those plans,\u201d he said at a fund-raiser last week in Manhattan, a message he is expected to reiterate. Ms. Warren is unlikely to pursue the kind of personal, premeditated broadside that Senator Kamala Harris launched against Mr. Biden in the first debate. But she has emerged onstage as a skilled advocate for her message of \u201cbig, structural change\u201d and has shown that she is capable of crisply defending her far-reaching proposals. \u201cWe start with a plan, and then we get out there and fight for it,\u201d she told reporters in Austin, Tex., on Tuesday when she was asked about Mr. Biden\u2019s focus on what progressive proposals are achievable. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s what being president is all about. It\u2019s about laying those plans out and showing the direction for this country, and then getting in the fight, leading the fight and bringing people along.\u201d At Thursday\u2019s debate, Ms. Warren will have another opportunity to stress the urgency of fixing what she views as an economic and political system that caters to the rich and powerful at the expense of working people. Mr. Biden, a Beltway veteran, is expected to preach pragmatism, with a focus on how to achieve Democratic priorities in a divided political moment. [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] One risk for Mr. Biden is that, while he connects well with voters in one-on-one interactions, he is prone to uneven and sometimes faltering performances onstage. And the debate arrives as he has faced scrutiny for a series of gaffes and misstatements. \u201cVice President Biden has not proven to be really great on his feet,\u201d said Steve Drahozal, chairman of the Dubuque County Democratic Party in Iowa. \u201cI know he does not think that his gaffes are a big deal, but he is going up against a very keen, intelligent, articulate candidate who is able to frame issues very well.\u201d A strong night for Ms. Warren could further propel her already-accelerating campaign both nationally and especially in Iowa, the state that begins the presidential primary process, where Mr. Biden already faces challenges. \u201cShe\u2019s been the one who\u2019s been gaining the most,\u201d Mr. Drahozal said. \u201cWith Biden being in the front-runner position, I don\u2019t think he has a lot to gain. He has a lot to lose.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s team has no illusions about Ms. Warren\u2019s skill as a debater and her rise in the polls, advisers and others close to the campaign acknowledge, though they insist that they are not focusing on her alone. Mr. Biden spent the first two debates facing intense criticism from his opponents, a reflection in part of his current standing atop the polls, and his campaign is bracing for more broadsides from all across the stage. Allies noted that Mr. Biden has survived rough debate performances before, with little lasting impact on his national poll numbers. That, they argue, is evidence of the deep-seated good will that Mr. Biden, President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, continues to enjoy from the Democratic base. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] They also see several opportunities for him to draw contrasts that could work to his benefit. That list includes emphasizing his foreign policy credentials \u2014 as a former vice president and a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 amid several prominent foreign policy-related controversies involving the Trump administration. His team is convinced that the Democratic electorate is far more moderate than some activists suggest, and welcomes a debate over issues like health care \u2014 Mr. Biden supports a public option but opposes eliminating private insurance, something Ms. Warren supports under \u201cMedicare for all\u201d \u2014 and which social programs should be offered for free. And allies are eager to deepen an argument Mr. Biden has been previewing: that it is not enough to have ambitious plans if those proposals cannot survive the political realities of Washington. \u201cLots of other candidates have great plans, they have good policy papers, many of them have, you know, talked about them on college campuses or in the Senate,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. \u201cThe difference, I think, is that Joe has decades of actual experience getting things enacted in a bitterly divided and partisan Washington, and I think he can and should point to that.\u201d Ms. Warren did not face significant scrutiny from other leading contenders in the first two debates. Mr. Biden\u2019s allies are privately hopeful that she will be pressed on the details and practicalities of her proposals by several of the candidates onstage, as her formidable standing in the race now makes her a bigger target for attacks. Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden have clashed before, exchanging sharp words during a fight over the nation\u2019s bankruptcy laws, which culminated in the passage of a bill in 2005 that Mr. Biden supported and Ms. Warren opposed. In April, in response to a reporter\u2019s question on the day Mr. Biden entered the race, Ms. Warren took a swipe at him over the bankruptcy legislation they had disagreed about. But she has almost always refrained from overtly criticizing her rivals, and any kind of premeditated attack on Mr. Biden on the debate stage would be a significant departure from how Ms. Warren has approached the campaign so far. \u201cDifferent candidates have different imperatives in the debates, and there are some candidates that need to throw wild punches in order to get attention,\u201d said Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is backing Ms. Warren. \u201cFortunately, Elizabeth Warren is not in that camp.\u201d Still, Mr. Green said, \u201cJust because she doesn\u2019t throw a punch doesn\u2019t mean that she doesn\u2019t strongly show a contrast.\u201d Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller, who endorsed Ms. Warren on Monday, said there was no need for Ms. Warren to confront Mr. Biden on the debate stage. \u201cI think she has to challenge the Democratic Party and say, we can be incremental or we can be big and bold,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if she can showcase big and bold, I don\u2019t think she has to look at Joe Biden. I think she has to look directly into the camera and speak to the American people and Democrats.\u201d Speaking to reporters on Saturday at the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention, Ms. Warren portrayed the debate as an opportunity to share her message with a large audience. She received a far more raucous reception at the convention than did Mr. Biden, who was the first presidential candidate to speak. But asked to compare her welcome to Mr. Biden\u2019s, she did not engage. \u201cAll I can do is stand up and talk about why I\u2019m running,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to criticize any other Democrat or anyone else\u2019s campaign.\u201d Still, veteran Democrats caution that for all of the momentum she has enjoyed lately, Ms. Warren still has work to do in assuaging concerns about whether her unapologetically progressive candidacy would resonate in general election battlegrounds. \u201cElizabeth probably needs to show that she is ready to take on Middle America, the center of our country,\u201d said Sylvia Larsen, the former New Hampshire Senate president, who also questioned whether Mr. Biden could excite younger voters. \u201cOur primaries push people into a more left position and so to get back to a center \u2014 Joe already holds the center. And so, can Elizabeth Warren move back to the center if she\u2019s our nominee?\u201d Ms. Warren, for her part, has challenged the idea that a more moderate candidate is best positioned to win. At the convention Saturday, she told the crowd that \u201cwe can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in because we\u2019re scared.\u201d And at a house party in New Hampshire on Labor Day, she cautioned against \u201cnibbling around the edges\u201d \u2014 without mentioning Mr. Biden by name. \u201cI think what\u2019s going to carry us as Democrats is not playing it safe,\u201d she said.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader and self-described \u201cgrim reaper\u201d of liberal legislative dreams, settled into a routine of sorts during Barack Obama\u2019s second term whenever he felt he was cornered by Democrats. Mr. McConnell would rise from his chair in the Capitol, walk to his scheduler\u2019s desk, smile a tight smile, and ask: \u201cCan we get Joe Biden on the phone?\u201d That was precisely what happened in late 2012, when Republicans were still in the minority in the Senate, and Mr. McConnell hit an impasse with Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, over the elimination of Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy. As a New Year\u2019s Eve deadline approached, Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell hammered out an agreement in a dozen phone calls, aides to both men said, with Mr. Obama signing off on every move. The two sides struck a deal that delivered some, but far from all, of what Mr. Reid wanted. This year, as he runs for president, Mr. Biden cites that deal and others he cut with Mr. McConnell as proof of his skill in achieving bipartisan legislation in an otherwise hyperpartisan environment. \u201cI\u2019ll work with Mitch McConnell where we can agree,\u201d Mr. Biden said this month \u2014 adding that on some issues, like gun control, there was no room for compromise. That he could agree with Mr. McConnell on anything is a controversial statement for any Democrat to make these days. But in a sprawling field of 20 candidates, Mr. Biden stands out for his enduring belief in the good will of congressional Republicans. He insists that the G.O.P. has been bullied by President Trump but that civility and compromise will return to Washington once Mr. Trump is gone. It\u2019s a view that has been branded as na\u00efve and wistful by some Democratic rivals as well as by the ascendant left wing of his party. That criticism is particularly pointed with regard to Mr. McConnell, whose decision to block Mr. Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court in 2016 elevated him from mere obstructionist to arch-villain in the eyes of many Democrats. The criticism has only intensified in recent days as Mr. McConnell has rebuffed Democratic calls to quickly move ahead with gun control legislation and lashed out at Democrats for reviving attacks on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. As a result, many in the party say, Mr. Biden\u2019s comfortable relationship with the Senate leader is not only out of date, but dangerous. \u201cMitch McConnell over the last decade has basically been on a crusade to destroy the Senate, so this idea that just getting rid of Trump would somehow send us back to some Golden Age in the Senate is ridiculous,\u201d said Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a rival presidential candidate. Mr. Bennet was one of three Democratic senators to vote against the 2012 budget deal, viewing it as an unnecessary capitulation that has emboldened Mr. McConnell. \u201cYou have to have some pretty seriously rose-colored glasses to think that the last six years of the Obama administration showed great promise in terms of deliberation or legislation,\u201d Mr. Bennet said. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell were not especially close in their nearly 25 years together in the Senate. But interviews with two dozen people close to both men show that their relationship, while not quite an actual friendship, became stronger \u2014 and more mutually beneficial \u2014 during Mr. Obama\u2019s second term. Their negotiations offered Mr. Biden a more powerful role, and gave Mr. McConnell a congenial bargaining partner and what the Senate leader viewed as the path of least resistance to striking a deal, in the view of Biden critics. Mr. Biden and his defenders say he is being attacked for refusing to accept what they consider a false premise: that progress is possible only through the use of uncompromising political force. \u201cHow in the hell are you going to get a damned thing done if you don\u2019t talk to the other side?\u201d said former Senator Alan Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, who struck up an across-the-aisle friendship with Mr. Biden in the 1970s. \u201cI see people saying he can\u2019t be president because he talked to this one or that one,\u201d Mr. Simpson added. \u201cHere\u2019s what I want to tell them: You think you can be a United States senator, and do your job, really do your job, by not talking to the other side? You have to talk to the commies, the kooks, the racists, the Tea Party, you have to talk to everybody.\u201d Mr. Biden, 76, has said he is bound to Mr. McConnell and other opponents by \u201ccivility\u201d and an unbreakable, unwritten code that the Democratic leader Mike Mansfield preached to him early in his career: \u201cIt\u2019s always appropriate to question another man\u2019s judgment, but never appropriate to question his motives.\u201d As senators, Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell had little interaction. They served briefly together on the Judiciary Committee in the late 1980s, and worked on only one significant piece of legislation together, a 2007 measure seeking to improve human rights in Myanmar. By 2010, however, Mr. McConnell had reached two conclusions that pushed him toward Mr. Biden, according to a dozen people close to both men, who spoke anonymously to disclose private discussions. First, he did not believe he could work with Mr. Reid, a former prizefighter who viewed Mr. McConnell as an obstructionist who needed to be thwarted at all costs. Mr. McConnell, for his part, thought Mr. Reid was not a good-faith negotiator, and suspected Democrats were leaking details of negotiations, two people close to him said. Then there was Mr. Obama. The two men felt deeply uncomfortable in each other\u2019s presence, according to their aides and their own public statements. In his book, Mr. McConnell admitted he privately called the president \u201cProfessor Obama\u201d because he was so prone to lecturing him. Mr. Obama and his aides thought Mr. McConnell was disdainful and taciturn, according to former members of Mr. Obama\u2019s staff. \u201cFrom the beginning, it was clear that President Obama wanted Biden to take the lead with McConnell,\u201d said Ted Kaufman, a longtime aide and friend to Mr. Biden. \u201cBiden had a very realistic view of McConnell and knew that they had major differences.\u201d After being overshadowed during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, Mr. Biden embraced the opportunity to become a power player. In 2010, Mr. McConnell and Mr. Biden negotiated a last-minute deal that prevented a government shutdown. A year later, Mr. McConnell hit the Biden speed dial again, this time to avert a potentially catastrophic failure to raise the debt limit precipitated by Tea Party Republicans in the House. All of that was a dress rehearsal for 2012 and another showdown over the debt limit, the so-called fiscal cliff. Mr. Obama was fresh off a convincing re-election win over Mitt Romney that was propelled, in part, by his promise to scrap tax cuts for families earning more than $250,000, enacted by George W. Bush in 2001. Mr. Reid staked out a maximalist position, saying he was willing to go over the cliff; Mr. Obama, despite having campaigned on the issue, was worried \u201cthat a sudden major tax hike and massive spending cut could together trigger another recession,\u201d Gene Sperling, a top Obama economic aide, said in an interview. [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] Two days before the deadline, the talks stalled. That\u2019s when Mr. McConnell placed his call to Mr. Biden, who was on Air Force Two. \u201cGet off now!\u201d Mr. McConnell said in a voice mail message, according to former aides to both men. From there, things went fairly quickly. Mr. McConnell, aides said, was spooked by the election results and eager to cut a deal; Mr. Biden operated within a narrow range of parameters established by Mr. Obama and his economic team, but he also brought his own reassuring presence to the talks. \u201cWhen he\u2019d say, \u2018Mitch, it\u2019s Joe. You know me. I am telling you there is no way we can go there\u2019 \u2014 that kind of thing was always more convincing coming from him,\u201d Mr. Sperling recalled. At one tense moment, Mr. Biden \u2014 hunched over a speakerphone in his office with Mr. Sperling and other staff members \u2014 struggled to remember the name of Rohit Kumar, the McConnell adviser crunching the numbers for Republicans. \u201cOh, hell, can I just call you Mitch\u2019s guy?\u201d Mr. Biden said, according to a person who was on the call \u2014 to laughter. The deal they struck was a partial victory for Democrats, raising top tax rates for families earning more than $450,000 and extending some unemployment insurance benefits. \u201cI feel very, very good,\u201d Mr. Biden told reporters on New Year\u2019s Day. Others did not. A handful of progressive Democrats \u2014 including Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 stormed into Mr. Reid\u2019s office to complain, according to Democratic aides. He told them to vote with their consciences and informed the White House he would back the deal, but would not sell it. The measure passed easily. During a follow-up meeting in the Oval Office in early 2013, Mr. Obama pressed Mr. McConnell to work on a long-term budget package before the 2014 midterms, when he would be running for re-election in Kentucky, Mr. Reid recalled in a recent phone interview. Mr. McConnell said that was impossible \u2014 Republican primary challengers could use it against incumbents. Mr. Biden responded by saying, \u201cMitch, we want to see you come back,\u201d Mr. Reid said. In recent years, Mr. Biden has not been shy about criticizing Mr. McConnell\u2019s actions, especially the decision to block Judge Garland. But he has been loath to denounce him personally \u2014 to the annoyance of some of his own staff members, according to a current Biden adviser. Neither man has much incentive these days to highlight their bonhomie: Mr. McConnell will also be running for office in 2020, seeking a seventh term. His office declined to comment for this story. But both men spoke affectionately about each other when there was less at stake politically. In December 2016, Mr. McConnell offered an emotional send-off to Mr. Biden from the well of the Senate, recounting a boyhood battle that echoed his own struggles with polio as a toddler. \u201cThe man we honor today wasn\u2019t always a talker,\u201d he said. \u201cHe suffered from a debilitating stutter for most of his childhood. He was teased for it. But he was determined to overcome it. And so he did.\u201d When Mr. Biden\u2019s son Beau died in 2015, Mr. McConnell was the only Senate Republican to attend his funeral, a gesture that deeply moved Mr. Biden, according to a person close to Mr. McConnell. In 2011, Mr. Biden, commenting on the large crowd that saw him speak at the University of Louisville\u2019s McConnell Center, peered at his host and said: \u201cYou want to see whether or not a Republican and Democrat really like one another. Well, I\u2019m here to tell you we do.\u201d",

      "content": "  CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. found himself fending off new questions about his decades-long record on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, in a testy exchange with a moderator who described his treatment of her as \u201ccondescending.\u201d During a Friday night forum focused on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, Mr. Biden seemed to recoil from the direct questioning from Lyz Lenz, a Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist. In a question-and-answer session, Ms. Lenz repeatedly pressed Mr. Biden about his past votes for the Defense of Marriage Act, the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy that forbade openly gay people from serving and his statement earlier this year that Vice President Mike Pence, known for his socially conservative positions, was \u201ca decent guy.\u201d Mr. Biden sought to defend himself, reminding the audience in a steamy auditorium that he supported same-sex marriage before President Obama. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to evolve,\u201d he said. Then, before an audience of 700 volunteers, activists and voters, he called Ms. Lenz \u201ca lovely person,\u201d prompting her to reply, \u201cjust asking the questions people want to know. Offstage after their exchange, she wrote on Twitter that Mr. Biden called her \u201ca real sweetheart.\u201d \u201cI interpreted it as a little condescending,\u201d Ms. Lenz said in a backstage interview, echoing the immediate criticism of some prominent feminists on social media. Supporters of Mr. Biden said Ms. Lenz\u2019s questions included a series of inaccuracies. His supporters said he didn\u2019t back \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d and voted for an amendment to remove the measure from a broader bill in 1993. They also argue that she misrepresented the impact of the 1994 crime bill that he championed. Mr. Biden had already responded to criticism of his comments about Mr. Pence earlier this year, writing on Twitter shortly after his initial remark that \u201cthere is nothing decent about being anti-L.G.B.T.Q. rights, and that includes the vice president.\u201d The forum, hosted by advocacy group Glaad, marked the first extended public discussion of L.G.B.T.Q issues in the 2020 Democratic primary race, which went largely unmentioned in the Democratic debates so far despite the group representing a loyal bloc within the Democratic Party. The focus on candidates\u2019 past departures from contemporary progressive politics stemmed in large part from the lack of daylight between most of the major candidates on issues of L.G.B.T.Q. equality: nearly all back banning conversion therapy for minors; rolling back the spread of rules that allow religious businesses to decline serving L.G.B.T.Q. customers; and ending the Trump administration transgender military ban. Most have promised to pass the Equality Act, legislation opposed by the White House that would bolster the list of protected classes under civil rights law to include discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about time we had a woke president on these issues,\u201d Senator Cory Booker said, \u201cso we see everyone for the equal dignity and equal citizenship we all have.\u201d The candidates boasted about their accomplishments \u2014 large and small \u2014 on behalf of L.G.B.T.Q Americans. Mr. Booker noted that as mayor of Newark, he had vowed not to officiate any weddings until everyone had the right to wed. Senator Elizabeth Warren opened her appearance by reading the names of 18 trans women of color who have been killed this year. Mr. Biden said he has been sympathetic to same-sex couples since he was a boy, when, he said, he and his father witnessed two men kissing while disembarking from the train station in Wilmington, Del. \u201cHe said, \u2018Joey, it\u2019s simple,\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThey love each other.\u201d In a historically diverse field, the L.G.B.T.Q. community has celebrated their own record-breaking first: Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., the first openly gay man to mount a major campaign for president. Though Mr. Buttigieg has collected significant financial support from leaders in the gay community, some have begun to question his commitment to their causes. While Mr. Buttigieg frequently references his husband, Chasten, at campaign events and told his coming out story on the debate stage last week as an example of resiliency, he hasn\u2019t placed L.G.B.T.Q. equality at the center of his campaign. He faced questions about a ban on gay men donating blood, pointing out that as mayor he couldn\u2019t participate in a blood drive sponsored by his office. \u201cIt\u2019s an example, one of many examples, of the exclusions in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still living with the long tail of prejudices.\u201d Other candidates also came with long records to tout. Mr. Biden, a reliable L.G.B.T.Q. ally, frequently points to his early support of gay marriage, noting his decision to break with the Obama administration and publicly endorse the policy in 2012. Mr. Obama followed a few days later. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii faced questions about her history of anti-gay stances, including decrying \u201chomosexual extremists\u201d when her home state debated whether to legalize civil unions more than a decade ago. Ms. Gabbard has apologized for her past statements and said she no longer holds those views. \u201cMy record speaks for itself,\u201d she said, citing her history of serving with L.G.B.T.Q people in the military and congressional record of supporting equality measures. About 5 percent of voters in the four early Democratic primary states \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u2014 identify as L.G.B.T.Q., according to data collected by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest L.G.B.T.Q. rights organization. Another 23 percent prioritize L.G.B.T.Q.-inclusive policies when voting, according to the group. The event is the first of two forums hosted by L.G.B.T.Q. organizations to question the candidates on their views. A second event, hosted by Human Rights Campaign in Los Angeles, will be broadcast on CNN next month.",

On Tuesday, Mr. Biden made his biggest move yet, saying Congress should start an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump if he does not cooperate with their investigations. In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself, who associates say has been astounded both by Mr. Trump\u2019s contact with the Ukrainian government and his obvious enthusiasm for attacking Mr. Biden\u2019s family. He and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponents, according to people familiar with their thinking, and now the scrutiny of Mr. Biden\u2019s son is bound to intensify. And as Mr. Trump\u2019s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump. Bryce Smith, the Democratic Party chairman in Dallas County, Iowa, said the moment showcased Mr. Biden as a candidate Mr. Trump is \u201cgenuinely worried about\u201d and offered a reminder of the lengths Mr. Trump may go to oppose any Democratic opponent. But it also exposed Mr. Biden to risks in the leadoff caucus state, he said. \u201cI could see people who are already on the fence about him, maybe because of his long career in politics, his age, his ability to win this, kind of going, \u2018Oh, great, we\u2019re already starting this and he hasn\u2019t even gotten the nomination,\u2019\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cAnd others going, \u2018He\u2019s obviously being thought of as a formidable opponent, if Trump is thinking about it like this.\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden and his campaign team have encouraged the latter interpretation, trying to project an image of strength in the primary and warning the press that the Biden campaign would deliver blunt criticism about coverage it sees as unfair. At a Philadelphia fund-raising event on Monday, Mr. Biden pledged, \u201cI\u2019m not going to take a punch and not punch back.\u201d Yet allies of Mr. Biden acknowledge privately that the campaign has been girding for months for criticism of Hunter Biden, who has charted a winding career as a bank executive, lobbyist and financier, often operating in parts of the private sector that overlapped with his father\u2019s footprint in government. They have declined to say whether they vetted Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities as part of preparing for the 2020 presidential campaign, arguing that the political world should be solely focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct. There is no evidence that Mr. Biden, as vice president, intentionally tried to help his son in his dealings with Ukraine, but Hunter Biden\u2019s business career has sporadically drawn attention from political rivals and the media for more than a decade. Associates say Mr. Biden is infuriated by Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and astonished by the president\u2019s willingness to dismiss some of the most basic ethical lines in American politics. In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president\u2019s actions an \u201cabuse of power\u2019\u2019 that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations. In some respects, Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden\u2019s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share. At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family. Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, who saw Mr. Biden at a fund-raiser in Iowa on Saturday, said he believed that Mr. Trump\u2019s dangerous conduct was at the forefront of Mr. Biden\u2019s mind. \u201cI suspect he\u2019s just as focused and just as concerned about that as he is about an attack on a family member, as personal as that is,\u201d said Mr. Vilsack, who served as agriculture secretary in the Obama administration. A memo circulated to political surrogates from the Biden campaign on Tuesday urged supporters to note that \u201cthis isn\u2019t about Biden or his family. We all know who Trump is,\u201d and also suggested criticizing reporters for giving undeserved coverage to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Mr. Biden and his son. \u201cTrump is successfully playing the same game he played in 2016 \u2014 and the press is falling for it again,\u201d the memo stated. This clash has come at a precarious moment for Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy, as he seeks to recover momentum after a largely limp summer on the campaign trail. He has slipped in the polls over the last two months and faces an increasingly formidable challenge from Senator Elizabeth Warren: Two polls released in recent days showed her slightly overtaking him in Iowa and New Hampshire, the leadoff states in the Democratic nomination process. In the short term, at least, Mr. Trump may have effectively put Hunter Biden off limits for his father\u2019s Democratic rivals. It is unlikely that any other candidate in Mr. Biden\u2019s party would soon follow Mr. Trump in going after the former vice president\u2019s son on the subject of business ethics, while Mr. Trump may face an impeachment inquiry for allegedly pressuring a foreign government to do just that. Senator Bernie Sanders, for one, deflected a reporter\u2019s question on Tuesday about whether he thought the sudden focus on Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas work would weaken the Biden campaign. \u201cYou guys write very perceptive articles on these things, and I\u2019ll let you make that judgment,\u201d he replied. It is unclear, however, how well prepared Mr. Biden and his campaign may be to address questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings beyond the specific case Mr. Trump has attempted to raise. Hunter Biden has operated for years in parts of the business world that intersected with his father\u2019s career in government, including working for MBNA, a Delaware-based bank, while his father was involved in rewriting the bankruptcy code as a senator, and leading an investment fund that did business in foreign countries while his father was vice president. Hunter Biden\u2019s work for MBNA briefly became an issue during his father\u2019s campaign for the vice presidency in 2008, and Obama-Biden campaign officials defended it as within the bounds of ethical propriety. TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, said the former vice president was indeed angry that Mr. Trump was \u201clying about his family, and now appears to be blackmailing a foreign government into helping legitimize those lies.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s fighting back, which is what Democrats want to see in their nominee and why he will beat Donald Trump next fall,\u201d Mr. Ducklo said, adding, \u201cThe V.P. and his family know Donald Trump plays dirty, and they can take it.\u201d Mr. Ducklo declined to say whether the campaign had vetted Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings and said the media should not be asking questions like that. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to indulge Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories, and we\u2019re not going to dignify his attacks with a response,\u201d he said. Mr. Biden is said to have limited patience for discussing Hunter Biden\u2019s apparent political vulnerabilities, even in private. Some of Mr. Biden\u2019s close advisers have argued in private settings that going after any member of Mr. Biden\u2019s family \u2014 including Hunter Biden \u2014 would ultimately backfire on an opponent, because of Mr. Biden\u2019s stature and the sympathetic feelings much of the public has for him and his family. For Mr. Biden, the matter of his son is deeply sensitive for reasons that have nothing to do with politics: While the whole Biden family endorsed his choice to enter the 2020 race, friends of Mr. Biden said consistently throughout his deliberations that his deepest anxiety was the impact of a campaign on a family still grappling with profound loss after the death of Mr. Biden\u2019s elder son, Beau Biden, in 2015, from brain cancer. \u201cI know that he worked through that, he did a lot of contemplation about how it would affect the family,\u201d said the Rev. Joseph Darby, an influential South Carolina-based pastor who has known Mr. Biden for years. Earlier this year, Hunter Biden spoke in detail to The New Yorker magazine about the crippling grief he experienced after his brother\u2019s death, and his long-running struggles with drug addiction. The magazine story also detailed a number of potential ethical conflicts in Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities and described the vice president as having dealt \u201cwith Hunter\u2019s activities by largely ignoring them.\u201d",

      "content": " RENO, Nev. \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday night delivered his most forceful response yet to President Trump\u2019s attacks on him and his son, accusing the Trump team of waging a campaign of \u201clies, smears, distortions and name calling\u201d geared at knocking him out of the presidential race. Mr. Biden made his comments during a campaign swing through Nevada after days of internal debate among his advisers over how best to refute unsubstantiated claims by the president and his personal lawyer that Mr. Biden improperly assisted his son\u2019s business ventures in Ukraine and China. The counterattack, people close to Mr. Biden said, was intended to demonstrate what he had been promising supporters for the past week: that he would not let Mr. Trump \u201chijack\u201d his campaign by allowing the president\u2019s narrative to take root. It was also intended to prove, in a walk-and-chew-gum kind of way, that he could multitask even when facing withering political fire \u2014 unveiling a serious policy proposal on guns early Wednesday in Las Vegas, then pivoting to a sharp political attack by nightfall in the north. In the speech, the former vice president said the attacks on his family were intended to divert attention from the widening impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens \u2014 and he cited them as proof that the White House feared him more than any other Democratic presidential contender. \u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me: I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Mr. Biden told a crowd of about 500 at the Truckee Meadows Community College here. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me,\u201d he said to cheers from supporters, a handful wearing \u201cImpeach 45\u201d jerseys. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\u201d The American people, Mr. Biden said, \u201cknow me and they know him. The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone\u2019s credibility is a joke.\u201d Earlier in the day, speaking at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas, Mr. Biden blasted the president and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had communicated with Ukrainian officials on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf. He said there was \u201czero, zero, zero\u201d evidence that his family had done anything wrong. Mr. Biden\u2019s increasingly bitter fight with Mr. Trump comes at a potential tipping point in the 2020 Democratic presidential race. Until recently, Mr. Biden had been leading in most national polls since he entered the field last spring. But Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, fueled by a highly disciplined campaign, has surged in many early-voting states. A Monmouth University national poll released Wednesday showed Mr. Biden locked in a statistical dead heat with Ms. Warren, who garnered 28 percent support from Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters to his 25 percent, a difference within the survey\u2019s margin of error. At Wednesday night\u2019s rally, Mr. Biden took a swipe at some of his Democratic opponents who had accused him of focusing too much on Mr. Trump and not enough on issues facing voters. \u201cA lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI agree. We have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s team has been alarmed by reports that Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters plan to launch an aggressive advertising campaign to portray the former vice president as the person who had acted improperly \u2014 despite the lack of any evidence to support that claim. And Mr. Biden\u2019s top advisers have been equally incensed by what they view as the news media\u2019s willingness to air unsupported allegations by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani. The president and his lawyer have alleged that Mr. Biden, as vice president, pressured the Ukrainians to force out a top prosecutor in order to derail an inquiry into a Ukrainian company that had paid his son, Hunter Biden. But Mr. Biden said Wednesday that he had been enforcing the demands of the Obama administration and other Western nations by seeking to replace the prosecutor with an official more committed to fighting corruption. On Sunday, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, two senior Biden strategists, wrote to several major television networks asking them to stop booking Mr. Giuliani on their news programs, accusing him of spreading \u201cdebunked conspiracy theories.\u201d Mr. Biden amplified that argument on Wednesday, urging reporters to regard Mr. Trump\u2019s statements, and his tweets, as not simply fodder for controversy but as a dangerous \u201cabuse of power\u201d that included enlisting foreign leaders as allies in his re-election effort. Mr. Trump, he said, is \u201cafraid of just how badly I would beat him next November.\u201d The president, in his own remarks on Wednesday, did not agree. \u201cI\u2019d rather run against Biden than almost any of those candidates,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House.",

      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": " Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s presidential campaign has sharply scaled back his online advertising, cutting spending so severely since August that he is now investing only a fraction of what his top rivals are on Facebook and Google, the two dominant internet platforms. In a race where many voters are following politics on their smartphones, Mr. Biden\u2019s pullback is an unusual and potentially worrisome sign about his appeal among the Democratic activists, young people and donors who are especially engaged on social media. Candidates rarely withdraw so much money from their online campaigns unless they are seeing weak results in online fund-raising, according to interviews with digital strategists. Mr. Biden and other candidates will start announcing fund-raising results as early as Tuesday morning for the third quarter of 2019; he came in second for the last quarter, behind Pete Buttigieg, pulling in online money early but mostly relying on big donors. More recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other top rivals have outspent Mr. Biden online: He was only the sixth-biggest Democratic spender on Facebook ads in the seven days ending Saturday, even as he began spending more money on digital ads targeting President Trump, Ukraine and impeachment. Instead, he has shifted his spending priorities toward traditional tactics like buying television ads in Iowa. But that strategy has not paid dividends so far: Ms. Warren, a leading rival for the 2020 nomination, recently surpassed him in a key Iowa poll. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign strategy has been driven, from the start, by the political assumption that the Democratic electorate is more moderate than the progressives who are often loudest online, and he has built his candidacy around appealing to older and more centrist voters. But strategists say Mr. Biden\u2019s online pullback is risky if he hopes to engage and build support among a broader cross-section of Democrats that is almost certainly necessary to win the nomination. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there\u2019s something in the numbers that\u2019s directing them to go in that direction, and the likeliest explanation is that the rate of return just wasn\u2019t there for Facebook and Google,\u201d said Tim Lim, a veteran Democratic digital strategist unaligned in 2020. \u201cWhich is very, very unusual.\u201d Zac Moffatt, a Republican strategist who led digital operations for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential run, said abandoning a medium used heavily by so many \u201creeks of desperation.\u201d \u201cYou are spending at least a third to half your life on your mobile phone, and they\u2019re deciding they don\u2019t need to have a message for you there,\u201d Mr. Moffatt said. Online spending serves two purposes: Promoting the candidates\u2019 messages and raising money. The Biden campaign said it was committed to an ongoing digital plan, with a seven-figure digital ad buy planned in the fourth quarter of 2019. But if Mr. Biden struggles to collect small donations online, he will have to depend more on traditional donors and bundlers while his two leading rivals, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, emphasize their grass-roots support. The decline of Mr. Biden\u2019s online spending has been precipitous. He entered the race in April as one of the contest\u2019s biggest digital advertisers, spending $1.2 million on Facebook and Google in his first two weeks. Now he is toward the back of the pack. During a 30-day stretch leading up to the September debate, Mr. Biden, who has regularly led the field in national polls, ranked 16th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising on Facebook, spending only $32,000 \u2014 placing the former vice president behind two candidates who dropped out during that period and five who did not make the debate stage. And on Google, his spending plunged to $300 during one week in August \u2014 less than one-thousandth of what he spent in his first week as a candidate, when campaigns often spend the most. Ms. Warren spent $66,000 that same week. The Biden campaign cast its diminishing digital footprint as part of a broader strategy. \u201cOur campaign invested a robust digital spend early on to build out supporter lists, outspending all other campaigns from our launch through most of the summer,\u201d said T.J. Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden. \u201cBy strategically front-loading our investment, we were able to rapidly expand our reach early, instead of meting out our spend over a longer period of time.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s digital spending has ticked up in recent days, as he bought a slate of Facebook ads related to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to have Ukraine investigate the Biden family (\u201cStand with Joe,\u201d some ads say). The exploding story line about foreign interference and impeachment has been good for Mr. Biden\u2019s bottom line: A campaign official said the past week was Mr. Biden\u2019s best for fund-raising since the second week of his campaign. While Mr. Biden\u2019s Facebook ads, like his stump speech, have focused heavily on Mr. Trump, records show he has also tested messages on health care, Medicare, the Supreme Court and guns. The Biden campaign noted that it was still investing in other online platforms that make less advertising data available to the public, such as Spotify, Amazon and Hulu.  Mr. Biden began his campaign with a show of strength, raising $6.3 million in the first 24 hours from nearly 100,000 people. He began with a key advantage: Formerly President Barack Obama\u2019s running mate, he had access to the old email list from the Obama campaigns. Daily fund-raising data through June shows that Mr. Biden\u2019s first days were his strongest for attracting online donations. But in the last six weeks for which data is available, Mr. Biden spent a meager $20,900 on Google, a platform that includes both the internet\u2019s dominant search engine and YouTube. In that same six-week span, Ms. Warren spent more than 25 times as much: $553,700. \u201cIt is not a good sign for his campaign,\u201d said Marne Pike, the chief executive of a Democratic digital strategy firm not affiliated with any 2020 candidate. \u201cI would have a very hard time imagining no one was searching for Joe Biden and clicking on the ads.\u201d It was a similar story on Facebook. There, Mr. Buttigieg has been the top spender, outpacing Mr. Biden in the last 30 days by a ratio of about 12 to 1. Mr. Biden is being outspent by candidates who, like him, are household names with big campaign budgets (like Mr. Sanders, by more than 7 to 1 in the last 30 days), and also by lesser-known figures (the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who has struggled to raise money, by more than 2 to 1). As Mr. Biden has withdrawn from Facebook and Google, he has bought up more than $700,000 in television ads in recent weeks in Iowa. Despite those ads, Ms. Warren recently edged ahead of him in the closely monitored Des Moines Register poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers. Mr. Ducklo, the Biden spokesman, said small contributions \u201chave been essential to getting our campaign message in front of voters: funding our television ads in Iowa and rapidly expanding the field operations in the early states that is knocking doors and making calls.\u201d Andrew Bleeker, president of the Democratic digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive, said that Mr. Biden\u2019s more moderate position in the Democratic primary could make it harder to raise money online. \u201cFrom a brand perspective, he can\u2019t be that incendiary and that\u2019s what\u2019s rewarded online,\u201d he said. Keegan Goudiss, who served as Mr. Sanders\u2019s director of digital advertising in 2016 but is unaligned in 2020, agreed: \u201cJoe Biden hasn\u2019t thrown the kind of red meat he needs to throw to do well online.\u201d Mr. Biden has also wrapped his candidacy in an aura of inevitability, which does not allow him to sound the alarm to supporters, a tactic that can juice online giving. (Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, for instance, recently scored his biggest day for online donations when he said he would quit the 2020 race if he failed to raise $1.7 million by the end of this month.) One startling measure of Mr. Biden\u2019s diminished online fund-raising ambition is the goal his campaign announced for the last days of September: raising $500,000. By contrast, Mr. Buttigieg set out to raise $1.5 million online, Senator Kamala Harris of California $1 million, former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas $750,000 and the businessman Andrew Yang $1.5 million. At this juncture in the election cycle \u2014 with the first primary votes still more than four months away \u2014 most campaigns with spare money are still spending heavily online for what they call \u201cacquisition\u201d: convincing people to give their email addresses through petition drives, online surveys and the like. Those people are then wooed to become donors. But for Mr. Biden, an analysis of both the content and geographic distribution of his ads suggests he had mostly abandoned trying to acquire new online donors in the last month \u2014 at least until the recent Ukraine controversy. The Biden campaign said it had put $40,000 into ads over two days last week, more than it spent on Facebook during that recent 30-day stretch. The ads that Mr. Biden has been running target an older electorate than that of his top rivals, according to demographic data collected by Bully Pulpit. An overwhelming share of his spending on Facebook \u2014 84 percent \u2014 has targeted voters who are 45 or older. Compare that to Mr. Sanders, who recently touted that the most common age among his donors is 29. Only one-third of his Facebook ad budget has targeted those above 45.",

      "content": " President Richard M. Nixon was running low on bipartisan allies. Indictments were piling. Impeachment was coming. Mr. Nixon was not a crook, he insisted, though that 18-and-a-half-minute gap in the Watergate tapes did make the town wonder. But from the Senate floor in April 1974, Joseph R. Biden Jr., a 31-year-old freshman Democrat, addressed his congressional elders with a plea: Let the Republican president have his say. \u201cIn the case of an impeachment trial, the emotions of the American people would be strummed, as a guitar, with every newscast and each edition of the daily paper,\u201d Mr. Biden warned. \u201cThe incessant demand for news or rumors of news \u2014 whatever its basis of legitimacy \u2014 would be overwhelming.\u201d He urged against \u201cAlice-in-Wonderland\u201d justice: \u201csentence first, verdict afterwards.\u201d He said that if he had to render a judgment on that day, his choice would be \u201cNot Guilty.\u201d Mr. Biden was no fan of the president\u2019s, he said \u2014 and might well find him culpable once all facts were aired. But this was a time for \u201crestraint.\u201d \u201cI have a feeling,\u201d he said, \u201cthat my children and my grandchildren will be looking back on what I said or did not say in April of 1974.\u201d Forty-five years later, Mr. Biden finds himself consumed by an impeachment drama of a different sort. He is at the center of the emerging Democratic case against President Trump, who in a July phone call pressed the president of Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and his son. It is a testament to the long and winding arc of Mr. Biden\u2019s public life that he has been a player in every major impeachment debate of the last half-century. Yet while other 2020 candidates have long argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct demands an extraordinary constitutional response, Mr. Biden has approached the subject with striking wariness, quick to defend his name but disinclined to position himself as an impeachment crusader, despite the perils the president\u2019s unsubstantiated attacks may pose to Mr. Biden\u2019s own campaign. On Wednesday, after weeks of caution \u2014 leaving the task to Congress, taking care to stay in his lane \u2014 Mr. Biden called unambiguously for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment for the first time, saying the president had \u201cbetrayed this nation.\u201d It was a moment that Mr. Biden reached reluctantly. Though he had said before that Mr. Trump had probably violated his \u201cconstitutional responsibility,\u201d the former vice president has also called Mr. Trump\u2019s prospective impeachment \u201ca tragedy.\u201d A review of Mr. Biden\u2019s history with the topic, as a senator during the Nixon and Clinton administrations, helps explain why. Decades before he moved from ensemble figure to leading character in the nation\u2019s impeachment theater, friends and peers from his Senate days say those episodes made plain to Mr. Biden just how damaging and unseemly the proceedings could be for all involved. In both public remarks and private conversations with colleagues, Mr. Biden conveyed his discomfort with overturning the will of the voters, regardless of the executive transgression. He suggested that public opinion should be taken into consideration, even for senators who preferred to vote their conscience, since it was the choice of the electorate that lawmakers presumed to override. \u201cThis. Is. Their. President,\u201d he thundered at an event in November 1998 as President Bill Clinton\u2019s fortunes rested with Congress, summarizing the view of Democratic voters whom Mr. Biden said he had met. \u201cDon\u2019t screw with him unless you have an overwhelming case that you can make that you\u2019re being fair about it.\u201d And in an early signal of Mr. Biden\u2019s deference to formal protocol, his experiences in the 1970s and 1990s seemed to crystallize the abiding faith in institutions \u2014 deep respect for the Senate, a reverence for process \u2014 that remains his hallmark, even as his current competitors suggest he is out of step with the crackling tribalism of the Trump era. \u201cHe stuck with kind of an institutional approach to things, which he did for his whole career,\u201d said Ted Kaufman, a longtime friend and aide who worked for Mr. Biden during Watergate and later succeeded him briefly as senator. \u201cLet the system work.\u201d For a young lawmaker straining to find his way amid personal tragedy, the Nixon fracas was an early test of Mr. Biden\u2019s defer-to-convention instincts and a jarring introduction to the capital. After his election in 1972, Mr. Biden had spoken to Mr. Nixon in an uncomfortable, minute-long courtesy phone call from the president after Mr. Biden\u2019s wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash that December. (\u201cI understand you were on the Hill at the time, and your wife was just driving by herself,\u201d Mr. Nixon said, stammering for a few beats, according to a recording. \u201cThe main part is, you can remember that she was there when you won a great victory.\u201d) In his floor speech on impeachment, labeled in the Congressional Record under \u201cFairness to the President,\u201d Mr. Biden described himself as a harsh critic of Mr. Nixon, but he added that the president was due the \u201cutmost presumption of innocence.\u201d \u201cIn a day when equality is on everyone\u2019s lips, I suggest that in practice, in extraordinary times involving our highest office of government, some people may be, in fact, more equal than others,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cAnd in this case, I refer to the president. His official derelictions, if proved, and his subsequent ouster, should it occur, will have an impact on our institutions and upon ourselves as Americans, beyond that which it would have for any of us who are involved in such a proceeding.\u201d Moving through the Capitol, Mr. Biden seemed awed at the historical burden that greeted him. \u201cWe were walking down the hall and he said, \u2018What a time for me to come into the Senate,\u2019\u201d recalled Rufus Edmisten, then the deputy chief counsel to the Senate Watergate committee. \u201c\u2018I would come at a time like this.\u2019\u201d In his 2007 memoir, \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d Mr. Biden described a formative memory of a crucial meeting after Mr. Nixon asked Senator John Stennis, a conservative Democrat from Mississippi, to run interference for the White House by listening to the Watergate tapes and summarizing them for his colleagues, rather than insisting on their wide release. \u201cI remember what he said in the Democratic caucus that day: \u2018I\u2019ve thought long and hard on what my obligation is,\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden wrote, quoting Mr. Stennis, \u201c\u2018and I\u2019ve decided I am a Senate man. I am not the president\u2019s man. Therefore, I will not listen to the tapes. I am a man of the Senate.\u2019 I\u2019m proud to say I am a Senate man, too.\u201d Mr. Kaufman said that it was not until August, days before Mr. Nixon\u2019s resignation, that Mr. Biden became convinced that the president must go. The senator was walking to catch a train when word arrived that Charles Wiggins, a Republican congressman who had led the Nixon defense, had changed his mind amid revelations that Mr. Nixon had worked to conceal the Watergate break-in. \u201cHe just said, \u2018O.K., this is it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kaufman recalled of Mr. Biden. \u201cAnd he dictated, literally, to the staff person on what was a big deal: \u2018It was time for Nixon to resign.\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden and his fellow senators seemed relieved that the president had saved them the spectacle of a trial. \u201cNobody was looking forward to the trial,\u201d said J. Bennett Johnston, a former Democratic senator from Louisiana, remembering a petition in his home state to support Mr. Nixon, with some 40,000 names attached. \u201cThere was not as much support in the South for Nixon as there is for Trump now, but he was basically pretty popular. So nobody was looking forward to having to vote on that.\u201d A quarter-century later, when the Senate impeachment trial of Mr. Clinton began, Mr. Biden was not afforded the luxury of a presidential resignation. But with the leader of his own party under scrutiny, Mr. Biden often invoked his appeals for caution in the Nixon age as evidence that he was being intellectually consistent. He said it was a \u201cserious mistake\u201d to overlook public sentiment on impeachment, noting that Democrats had won gains in the 1998 midterm elections. He claimed that the Republican-led House, under Speaker Newt Gingrich, had \u201cproceeded without sufficient dignity.\u201d Barbara Boxer, a former California Democratic senator who joined Mr. Biden in clearing Mr. Clinton in the Senate trial, described impeachment as \u201ca miserable experience\u201d but one that played to Mr. Biden\u2019s strengths as a \u201cstatesman.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not just going to run out there in flames,\u201d she said. But at times, impeachment has also coaxed less subtle flourishes from Mr. Biden. In an appearance at the National Press Club in November 1998, after distinguishing between immoral and impeachable behavior, he set off on a hypothetical about Mr. Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, implying that had Ms. Lewinsky been Mr. Biden\u2019s daughter, he would have clocked the sitting president. \u201cWere it my daughter \u2014 notwithstanding this particular young woman is not the epitome of what I would want a young woman to be \u2014 I would be looking for the man,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThose who know me know I\u2019m not joking. I\u2019d be looking for him to give him a straight right.\u201d Notwithstanding this particular senator\u2019s fatherly dream sequence, he also reminded the crowd of his credibility on the broader question of Mr. Clinton\u2019s professional fate. \u201cI made that plea in 1974, and I make the plea again,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThe plea for restraint.\u201d",

On Monday, in response to a rebuke from Republicans, Trump tweeted: \u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!).\u201d Lupita Nyong\u2019o showed off her freestyle skills as her rapping alter ego, Troublemaker, on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d Will Smith will pop by \u201cThe Late Show\u201d to talk about his new film, \u201cGemini Man.\u201d Jeanette Winterson\u2019s new novel, \u201cFrankissstein,\u201d fictionalizes a pre-fame Mary Shelley, juxtaposing the author\u2019s early 1800s creation of Frankenstein\u2019s monster with a modern-day counterpart: a transgender surgeon creating sex bots.",

      "author": "Charles M. Blow",
      "content": " All five of these things are simultaneously true: Joe Biden is the Democratic front-runner and may well be the nominee. He is by far the favorite candidate among black voters. He was a loyal vice president to Barack Obama, and the two men seem to have shared a deep and true friendship. He, like the other Democratic candidates, would be a vast improvement over Donald Trump. And, Biden\u2019s positioning on racial issues has been problematic. This issue exposed itself again Thursday during the presidential debate in Houston. Moderator Linsey Davis put a question to Biden: \u201cMr. Vice President, I want to come to you and talk to you about inequality in schools and race. In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975, you told a reporter, \u2018I don\u2019t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather, I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I\u2019ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.\u2019 You said that some 40 years ago. But as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?\u201d Biden could have taken responsibility for his comments and addressed the question directly, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, he gave a rambling, nonsensical answer that included a reference to a record player. But, the response ended in yet another racial offense in which he seemed to suggest that black people lack the natural capacity to be good parents: We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t \u2014 they don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the \u2014 the \u2014 make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 a very poor background will hear four million words fewer spoken by the time they get there. His language reveals a particular mind-set, one of a liberal of a particular vintage. On the issue of race, it is paternalistic and it pities, it sees deficiency in much the same way that the conservative does, but it responds as savior rather than with savagery. Better the former than the latter, surely, but the sensibility underlying the two positions is shockingly similar. It underscores that liberalism does not perfectly align with racial egalitarianism, regardless of rhetoric to the contrary. On Sunday, Biden made a speech on race in Birmingham commemorating the 1963 bombing at the 16th Street Baptist Church, in which he said on the issue of how racism and racial hatred affect black people: \u201cWe know we\u2019re not there yet. No one knows it better. My mom used to have an expression, \u2018You want to understand me, walk in my shoes a mile.\u2019 Those of us who are white try, but we can never fully, fully understand. No matter how hard we try. We\u2019re almost, we\u2019re almost at this next phase of progress in my view.\u201d Progress. That is the wall behind which white America hides, including white liberals. (Even many black leaders have absorbed and regurgitate the progress narrative.) It expects black people to swell and applaud at their effort. But, how is that a fair and legitimate expectation? Slavery, white supremacy and racism, are horrid, man-made constructs that should never have existed in the first place. Am I supposed to cheer the slow, creeping, centuries-long undoing of a thing that should never have been done? Malcolm X was once asked if he felt that we were making progress in the country. He responded: \u201cNo. I will never say that progress is being made. If you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, there\u2019s no progress. If you pull it all the way out, that\u2019s not progress. The progress is healing the wound that the blow made.\u201d I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s progress. That just returns the situation to a common baseline before the crime was committed. Furthermore, it\u2019s not what Biden says in prepared remarks that\u2019s problematic, it\u2019s what he says off the cuff and under pressure that to me reveal an antiquated view on racial matters and racial sensitivities. It was the way he advocated for the 1994 crime bill, a bill that contributed to America\u2019s surging mass incarceration, which disproportionately affected black and brown people in this country. The bill did some good, but the harm it did cannot be overlooked or understated. Rather than fully owning up to to the disastrous aspects of the bill, Biden has over the years bragged about it and defended it. It was in the way he described then-candidate Barack Obama in 2007 as an African-American who was \u201carticulate and bright and clean.\u201d Clean? As opposed to what? This critique of Biden isn\u2019t personal. I bear no ill will for the man. But, a fact is a fact, and no amount of growth, change or well-intentioned good-heartedness has the ability to erase it.",

      "content": " The genius of Barack Obama lay in the fact that Americans looked at him and could believe in almost anything. The left of the Democratic Party saw the revolutionary incarnation of hope, the promise of sweeping social change, and, in a black president, the overturning of America\u2019s original sin. The center saw a measured product of Harvard Law School, a prudent reformer, a man of mixed identity and the middle ground. Moderates were closer to the mark. Obama, a cool man, proved cautious to a fault. Still, the way he cloaked his coolness and masked his aloofness in the language of the heart was brilliant. This time around, there is no such political genius out there among the Democratic contenders. The field appears to have narrowed to the occasionally befuddled and befuddling Joe Biden as the standard-bearer of moderation, and the nimble, plan-a-minute star of the campaign to date, Elizabeth Warren, with her progressive program of social and fiscal reform. Snapping at their heels, from a growing distance, is Bernie Sanders, with voice raised. His habitual dyspepsia has been sharpened by the way Warren steals his revolutionary thunder. No socialist, she; on the contrary, Warren calls herself a \u201ccapitalist to my bones,\u201d but ready, unlike Biden, to tax the superrich who have skewed America\u2019s promise. That\u2019s her economic patriotism \u2014 a smart way to fight Donald Trump\u2019s economic nationalism. Some game-changer may yet come along. Biden could blow himself up with a shocking moment of incoherence or insult that goes beyond his known liabilities. He has already come close to that. He will be more exposed in the months ahead than he was as vice president at the no-drama White House. If the moderate Democratic ground opens up, the temptation for Michael Bloomberg to fill it may prove overwhelming, or, just possibly, another candidate \u2014 Kamala Harris, Cory Booker \u2014 will gain that elusive traction. If Warren widens her lead over Sanders, will he withdraw in a way that might wrap it up for her? Railroaded out in 2016, when the Bernie-buzz was fresh, he will not, I suspect, be inclined to favors. Mr. Magnanimous he is not. Warren will have to fight it out. On the evidence, that will galvanize her. Biden is trying to bridge reassurance to the wealthy with outreach to energized progressives. That balancing act has maintained his lead in polls. If two Obama terms were not enough for you, he\u2019s offering something resembling a third \u2014 Obamacare Plus; a possible increase in capital-gains tax to address inequality. Will this fine-tuning be enough in an agitated America, whiplashed by President Trump? I doubt it. The under-30s, maybe under-40s, are underwhelmed by Biden, even angry that this honorable man has not chosen dignified retirement. He\u2019s the emblem of the permanent political class, the one that created the conditions for Trump, in an era that Trump\u2019s wild policy lurches and heresies and, yes, lies have now transformed. America\u2019s restoration, after this trauma, will not be achieved by going back. What created Trump cannot oust Trump. It will demand a new politics, and a new integrity, such as the one Warren has set out and embodied with greater vigor, persuasiveness and coherence than anyone else. Biden, on whom Trump may have been seeking dirt in a July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, can put an end to the president\u2019s sullying of the Oval Office. He can\u2019t, however, embody renewal. Is Warren too far left to win? Maybe. Does she worry some purple-district Democrats who did well in 2018? Yes. But she can adjust. As for \u201celectability,\u201d an overused word, well, Trump won, and may again, so all bets are off. I said Biden has come close to a blowup moment. The campaign is grueling. You don\u2019t have to be almost 77 to slip up. But he has demonstrated tone-deafness on race in a way that is disturbing. His reference to a \u201crecord player\u201d in the last Democratic debate in the context of a question about reparations for slavery tied Biden to a bygone era, but that was far from the worst of it. Talking about black families \u2014 that is what the question was about \u2014 he actually said: \u201cWe bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t, they don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the, the \u2014 \u2014 make sure the kids hear words.\u201d They don\u2019t know what to do! Make sure the kids hear words! This is insulting toward African-Americans. It\u2019s of a piece with Biden\u2019s comment (quickly adjusted) in August that \u201cwe have this notion that somehow if you\u2019re poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids.\u201d There\u2019s a way, and a need, to talk about fundamental systemic racial injustice, but this is emphatically not it. Black does not equal poor and inept. The genius has left a void. Right now it\u2019s not his vice president who may just fill it enough, but Warren.",

      "author": "Joe Biden",
      "content": " Each time a mass shooting strikes one of our communities we grieve. We gather our loved ones. We reach for answers and clamor for action. Each time, for a moment, it feels as if this time will be different. But then the news cycle rolls on. And we push down the gut-churning knowledge that it will be only a matter of time before it happens again. Between El Paso and Dayton only about 13 hours elapsed. Republican leaders try to prevent action and parrot N.R.A. messaging \u2014 as Donald Trump did last week when he said, \u201cMental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun.\u201d This is the same president who during his first year in office repealed a rule President Barack Obama and I put in place to help keep guns out of the hands of people with certain mental illnesses. This is the same president who said after Charlottesville that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides,\u201d and who continues to fan the flames of hate and white supremacy. We can\u2019t trust his diagnosis. We have a huge problem with guns. Assault weapons \u2014 military-style firearms designed to fire rapidly \u2014 are a threat to our national security, and we should treat them as such. Anyone who pretends there\u2019s nothing we can do is lying \u2014 and holding that view should be disqualifying for anyone seeking to lead our country. I know, because with Senator Dianne Feinstein I led the effort to enact the 1994 law that banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines for 10 years. Those gun safety reforms made our nation demonstrably more secure. They were also, sadly, the last meaningful gun legislation we were able get signed into law before the N.R.A. and the gun manufacturers put the Republican Party in a headlock. I fought hard to extend the assault weapons and high-capacity magazines bans in 2004. The Republicans who allowed these laws to expire asserted that they were ineffective. But, almost 15 years after the bans expired, with the unfortunate benefit of hindsight, we now know that they did make a difference. Many police departments have reported an increase in criminals using assault weapons since 2004. And multiple analyses of the data around mass shootings provide evidence that, from 1994 to 2004, the years when assault weapons and high-capacity magazines were banned, there were fewer mass shootings \u2014 fewer deaths, fewer families needlessly destroyed. There\u2019s overwhelming data that shootings committed with assault weapons kill more people  than shootings with other types of guns. And that\u2019s the point. Shooters looking to inflict mass carnage choose assault weapons with high-capacity magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds. They choose them because they want to kill as many people as possible without having to stop and reload. In Dayton, where the police responded immediately and neutralized the shooter within about 30 seconds, he was still able to massacre nine people and injure more than two dozen others because he carried an AR-style weapon with a magazine capable of holding 100 rounds. We have to get these weapons of war off our streets. Nearly 70 percent of the American public support a ban on assault weapons \u2014 including 54 percent of Republicans. When you have that kind of broad public support for legislation that will make everyone safer, and it still can\u2019t get through the Senate \u2014 the problem is with weak-willed leaders who care more about their campaign coffers than children in coffins. The 1994 assault weapons and high-capacity magazines bans worked. And if I am elected president, we\u2019re going to pass them again \u2014 and this time, we\u2019ll make them even stronger. We\u2019re going to stop gun manufacturers from circumventing the law by making minor modifications to their products \u2014 modifications that leave them just as  deadly. And this time, we\u2019re going to pair it with a buyback program to get as many assault weapons off our streets as possible as quickly as possible. I won\u2019t stop there. I\u2019ll get universal background checks passed, building on the Brady Bill, which establishing the background check system and which I helped push through Congress in 1993. I\u2019ll accelerate the development and deployment of smart-gun technology \u2014 something gun manufacturers have opposed \u2014 so that guns are keyed to the individual biometrics of authorized owners. There is so much we can do \u2014 practical, sensible steps that draw broad support among the American people. But we will see only more and deadlier shootings if we continue to dodge the core issue of unregulated assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in our communities. If we cannot rise to meet this moment, it won\u2019t just be a political failure. It will be a moral one. It will mean that we accept the next inevitable tragedy. That we are desensitized to children running from schools and bodies littering parking lots, that our outpouring of thoughts and prayers will grow increasingly hollow. It\u2019s unacceptable that children learn to fear mass shooters alongside their ABCs, that people feel unsafe on their weekly grocery run, and that families everywhere experience increasing anxiety that they are simply not safe anywhere in the United States. I, for one, won\u2019t stand for that. And the American people are with me.",
