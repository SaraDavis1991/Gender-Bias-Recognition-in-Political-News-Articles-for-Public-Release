When \"The View\" co-host responded to Stassen's post, she tagged Mindy Kaling, who created and starred on the comedy series that wrapped up in 2017 after six seasons. It was revealed Friday that McCain is set to release an audiobook in 2020. The new work will cover her dad, the late Sen. John McCain, as well as give\u00a0her thoughts on politics. According to\u00a0a screenshot, Stassen tweeted: \"Who in the (expletive) is going to buy this (expletive)?\" \"Sad to find out that you work with someone I greatly admire (and have for a long time) @mindykaling,\" McCain wrote on Twitter Saturday, \"I know we can\u2019t be judged by everyone we work with but still. \"What a cruel thing to say,\" she added. \"And my book is for women who are judged for being conservative (among many other people).\" Meghan McCain on getting booed by 'The View' audience, reveals her major regret Mindy Kaling shares bikini photo\u00a0with body positive message: 'You don\u2019t have to be a size 0' Stassen has deleted his post that set off McCain. Responding to a tweet from a commentor who reminded him, \"You don\u2019t have to. Don\u2019t be so rude,\"\u00a0Stassen replied, \"Fair enough.\" Some on Twitter questioned why Kaling was brought into it. \"Not Mindy's problem, Meghan,\" one Twitter user responded. \"Why bring Mindy into it? Publicly too?\" a person inquired. \"This is the 'I\u2019m speaking to your manager'\u00a0of tweets,\" another posted. Another guessed: \"@mindykaling is somewhere like why the hell did you have to drag me into this?!?!\" \"So you\u2019re judging & condemning. @mindykaling because .@davidstassen had the nerve to voice an opinion (which I believe is still legal),\" another remarked. \"Don\u2019t you get outraged when ppl hold you accountable for Ben\u2019s opinions or vice versa?\" the person added, sharing a screenshot from a June 23 tweet where McCain asked followers to see her and husband Ben Domenech as separate entities. \"Do you hold Ben accountable for everything I say on @TheView?\" asked McCain in her previous tweet.\u00a0\"I know this is a hard concept for some but we are not the same person, believe different things and love and respect each other\u2019s differences.\" Mindy Kaling won't\u00a0talk about daughter's father, but opens up on finding her maternal instinct Meghan McCain felt 'petrified'\u00a0about revealing miscarriage but decided to 'take the leap' USA TODAY has reached out to reps for Kaling and Stassen for comment.

      "content": " John Legend disagrees with the sentence fellow celebrity Felicity Huffman received Friday from being a part of the college admissions scandal. In a Boston courtroom, the \"Desperate Housewives\" alum was sentenced to 14 days in prison, a $30,000 fine, supervised release for one year and 250 hours of community service for paying $15,000 to have someone correct answers on the SAT exam of her and William H. Macy's oldest daughter, Sophia. \"I get why everyone gets mad when rich person X gets a short sentence and poor person of color Y gets a long one,\" read a Saturday tweet from Legend, founder of FreeAmerica, \"a campaign to transform America\u2019s criminal justice system,\" according to its website.\u00a0\"The answer isn't for X to get more; it's for both of them to get less (or even none!!!) We should level down not up.\" \"Americans have become desensitized to how much we lock people up,\" he shared in another post. \"Prisons and jails are not the answer to every bad thing everyone does, but we've come to use them to address nearly every societal ill.\" Felicity Huffman sentenced: 2 weeks in prison, $30,000 fine for college admissions scandal Though he did not address Huffman by name, he did reference her 2-week sentencing, describing it as ultimately meaningless. \"And no one in our nation will benefit from the 14 days an actress will serve for cheating in college admissions,\" he wrote. \"We don't need to lock people up for any of this stuff.\" Legend explained that he preferred other alternatives to prison when a Twitter user opposed his view. \"Yeah let's not have any consequences to crime... that'll work well,\" the critic remarked. \"When you think no prison = no consequences,\" Legend replied. \"There are other ways to hold people accountable than the state paying 10s of thousands a year to hold them in a secure facility\" Read Felicity Huffman's\u00a0full, emotional statement about her 14-day prison sentence That's not the only Twitter opponent Legend has had to face of late. The artist's Sept. 8,\u00a0appearance on MSNBC's final installment of\u00a0Lester Holt's \"Justice For All\" series, a report about the criminal justice system, ruffled the feathers of President Donald Trump. The nation's leader complained that he and his political party were not receiving the appropriate credit and\u00a0dragged the \"boring musician\" and his \"filthy mouthed wife\" Chrissy Teigen, who was not mentioned in the report. The judge in Huffman's case, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, addressed the actress' sentencing in court. \"I don\u2019t think anyone wants to go to prison,\" Talwani said. \"I do think this is the right thing here. I think without this sentence you would be looking at a future with a community around you asking how you got away with this.\" Meghan McCain defends Chrissy Teigen\u00a0after President Trump targets Teigen, John Legend Friday, Huffman said she was ready to \"accept the court\u2019s decision today without reservation.\" \"I broke the law. I have admitted that and I pleaded guilty to this crime. There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period,\" she said. \"I would like to apologize again to my daughter, my husband, my family and the educational community for my actions,\" she added. \"And I especially want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices supporting their children.\" Contributing:\u00a0Joey Garrison, Hannah Yasharoff and Anika Reed 'Legitimate donations': Lori Loughlin attorney previews college admissions defense in court 'I can't figure it out': John Stamos is still perplexed over Lori Loughlin scandal",

      "author": "Savannah Behrmann",
      "content": " WASHINGTON -- Nearly a week before the one-year anniversary of her husband Sen. John McCain's\u00a0death, Cindy McCain said the current Republican Party is \"not the party of Abraham Lincoln ... nor the party of Ronald Reagan.\" Known for his habit of being a political maverick, the late Sen. McCain, R-Ariz., forged a record of\u00a0bipartisanship through a willingness to create\u00a0relationships with lawmakers across the aisle in order to seek solutions. The six-term U.S. senator disclosed in July 2017 that he had been diagnosed with a deadly form of brain cancer called glioblastoma. Speaking out a\u00a0year after her husband\u2019s passing, Cindy McCain\u00a0emphasized that she doesn\u2019t see\u00a0anyone carrying on in the bipartisan way that her husband had for years in Washington. \"That was a tough torch to carry and, as John said, there were many lonely days because he always said what was on his mind,\" Cindy McCain said in an interview with ABC News. She continued explaining\u00a0that her husband \"never did anything deliberately to be hurtful or anything \u2026 I don't see anybody carrying that mantle at all, I don't see anyone carrying the voice -- the voice of reason.\" More: Trump calls the Danish Prime Minister 'nasty' after she nixes notion of Greenland sale She also touched on the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies and rhetoric. \u201cI think John would be very discouraged about the border situation right now with our immigrants and our refugees coming across the border now and their treatment.\u201d When pressed on how she thought her husband would have reacted to the \u201csend her back\u201d chants\u00a0that broke out at a Trump campaign rally referring to the \u201cSquad\u201d, McCain said her husband \"would not have accepted it.\" \u201cI'm quite certain he would have spoke out about it,\" she continued. \"These are American citizens -- these are our citizens.\" More: Cindy McCain's first year without John McCain: 'Trying to put our family back together' As the Arizona Republic reported, Cindy McCain likes to remind people of the momentduring the 2008 campaign when the senator, who was running against Barack Obama for the presidency, corrected a woman at a town hall who said she couldn\u2019t trust Obama because he was \u201can Arab.\u201d \u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d John McCain said. \u201cHe\u2019s a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues and that\u2019s what this campaign is all about.\u201d In an op-ed published by the Washington Post Wednesday, Cindy McCain also called for civility in government. \u201cJohn was a passionate partisan. But he was a statesman, too, and statesmen accept the necessity of cooperation and compromise to make some progress on the challenges our country faces,\u201d she wrote. \"When Congress returns from its August recess, I hope its veteran members, many of whom my husband was proud to call his friends, and its newest ones will energetically contest the issues of the day. I hope they will fight for their beliefs and enjoy the contest. But I hope, too, as John would, that they do it with minds open to the possibility of compromise for the country's sake, and hearts open to the possibility and joys of unexpected friendships,\" McCain also wrote. Through a video, Cindy McCain is also asking Americans to perform an act of civility and post about it on social media with the hashtag #ActsOfCivility. \u201cI believe most Americans would find great value in that approach to politics and governing, and to well-lived lives. It is time to inspire a renewal of civil engagement that is so critical to meet the challenges of the future,\u201d she concluded\u00a0in the op-ed. Speaking to the Arizona Republic, Cindy McCain shared some of her family's\u00a0struggles in coping\u00a0with the senator's death.\u00a0\u00a0\"My job is to make sure they\u2019re OK\u00a0 \u2014 that\u2019s my job,\" Cindy McCain said of her children. \"I have gotten calls in the middle of the night. I\u2019ve gotten calls from ones I didn\u2019t ever think that they would call me \u2026 Each situation is different.\" The Republic reported that Cindy McCain \"declined to comment directly about the president\u2019s attacks over the past year on her husband, and his rhetoric.\" ABC News likewise reported Wednesday that \"Despite her comments about the Republican Party as a whole, McCain did not call out Trump directly even with his frequent attacks on John McCain, including after his passing.\" Perhaps she felt that task\u00a0had already been completed in some way\u00a0by her late husband. As the Republic wrote \"the retired Navy captain and Vietnam prisoner of war had become a fixture in American and global politics before\u00a0his death\" and \"when he spoke to condemn the incivility and dysfunction that permeates American politics today, his voice was widely accepted as a counterweight to the combative style of politics and leadership embraced by President Donald Trump.\" Contributing:\u00a0Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, Arizona Republic",

O'Rourke told the Daily Beast in an interview published Thursday that \"I think the response should be, \u2018We\u2019re doing nothing now and we\u2019re seeing people slaughtered in their schools, at work, at a Walmart, in a synagogue, in a church, at a concert,'\" adding \"We should be worried about that kind of violence right now.\u201d Earlier this week, McCain, daughter of the late Sen.

He asserted that McCain\u2019s comments dismiss the problems surrounding gun violence. He continued, \u201cWhen someone says 'if you do this, then this will happen,' almost as though that\u2019s a natural response or maybe even something that should happen or deserves to happen.\" \"When I think the response should be: \u2018We\u2019re doing nothing now and we\u2019re seeing people slaughtered in their schools, at work, at a Walmart, in a synagogue, in a church, at a concert. There is violence right now and it is horrifying and it is terrifying and it is terrorizing.\u2019....We should be worried about that kind of violence right now.\u201d Meghan McCain responded to O'Rourke's comments in a tweet, saying: \"Beto is the only man in all of Texas who would revise \u2018Come and Take It\u2019 to \u2018Please, Come and Take It.\u2019\u201d The original phrase has come to represent defiance and pride to Texans dating back nearly 200 years. As the Houston Chronicle reported, the saying symbolizes \"defiance against someone or something looking to grind you down or deprive you of a right or privilege.\" O\u2019Rourke and McCain have clashed before when he was a guest on \u201cThe View\u201d and stood by comparing a controversial rally in North Carolina put on by President Donald Trump's re-election campaign\u00a0to a \"Nuremberg rally.\" in Nazi Germany. \"You\u2019re talking about Trump supporters, comparing them to Nazis in Nuremberg, that sounds extreme to me as well,\" McCain told O'Rourke at the time. \"When Democrats come on here and wax poetic about extremism\u2014I\u2019m not saying Trump isn\u2019t doing it, but you\u2019re calling everybody who was in that North Carolina rally a Nazi.\" \"From my standpoint, it seems like the left is pretty extreme as well,\" she added. \u201cWe all have accountability for our actions and everyone who shouted to send them back is responsible for that as well,\" he said to cheers from the studio audience on\u00a0\"The View\" in July More: Meghan McCain challenges O'Rourke on comment about Trump rally He later continued, \u201cI don't care who you voted for last time. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Trump supporter or a Republican. You\u2019re an American first before you are anything else and I call you to this country\u2019s greatness.\u201d O\u2019Rourke recently appeared on CNN\u00a0where he discussed gun violence after the shooting rampage in Odessa and Midland, Texas\u00a0that left seven dead. He said, \"To protect our kids, our families, our fellow Americans in public places. At a Walmart in El Paso where 22 were killed. In Sutherland Springs, in a Church. One or two a day all over this country. A hundred killed daily in the United States of America. We\u2019re averaging about 300 mass shootings a year. No other country comes close.\" \"So yes, this is f***** up,\" the former Texas congressman concluded. The comments echoed remarks he'd made at an event the night before. And his presidential campaign recently started selling a new T-shirt on the website\u00a0that repeats \"This is f*cked up\" and concludes with a call to action: \"End gun violence now.\" \"Beto for America\" is printed at the bottom of the t-shirt.

He was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, a degenerative nervous system disorder, in 2013. Meghan McCain pressed Sanders\u00a0to name a Republican\u00a0currently in office that he can work with to achieve bipartisanship. Sanders finally named Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee: \"Lamar is not a liar, Lamar is not a sexist, he's not a racist, he's not a homophobe. He's a conservative guy. It's called American politics.\" During Sanders' appearance on the daytime talk show, he was also pressed by co-host Whoopi Goldberg to address how he will deal with income inequality. She asked if he will change that, as she said candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang had pledged to do on a previous episode of the show. Sanders said, \"Of course I'll change it,\" Sanders said. \"Well, how do I know this?\" Goldberg replied. \"Because I've been talking about it for 25 years,\"\u00a0Sanders said, seemingly frustrated. Sanders also talked about his ability to defeat the current president in the 2020 election should he win the Democratic nomination, disagreeing with the idea that only a moderate Democratic candidate could take on Trump. \"I think the agenda that I am bringing forth is the most progressive agenda ever brought forth by any candidate \u2014serious candidate\u2060\u2014running for president of the United States,\" Sanders said.",

'The View' is back!\u00a0Where did we leave off? McCain, who referred to herself as the \"chick on the panel that spent most of her break shooting,\" quarreled with her co-hosts on gun control during the Season 23 premiere. \"This is a ground-level issue for me,\" McCain\u00a0said during a discussion around the\u00a0Aug. 31\u00a0mass shooting in\u00a0Odessa, Texas. \"If you\u2019re going to be a gun-grabber, you don\u2019t get my vote.\" She was referring to two 2020 Democratic presidential candidates: former Vice President Joe Biden, who said he wanted to\u00a0reinstate the federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, and former Rep.\u00a0Beto O\u2019Rourke, who\u00a0proposed a mandatory buyback\u00a0of\u00a0assault-style rifles. Meghan McCain: 'There's going to be a lot of violence' if assault weapons are banned \"The AR-15 is by far the most popular gun in America,\" McCain said. \"If you're talking about taking people\u2019s guns from them, there\u2019s going to be a lot of violence.\u201d She declared: \"I\u2019m not living without guns. \u2026 It\u2019s just that simple!\u201d McCain takes her job as the\u00a0talk show's only conservative voice seriously. \"I try to just remind myself that I'm representing 50% of the country,\" McCain\u00a0told\u00a0Entertainment Tonight. \"I'm representing a bunch of women even though I only have one chair, and it's really important.\" She continued:\u00a0\"I know there's people in the middle of the country that feel like they're really happy that someone is representing them.\" More:\u00a0Meghan McCain on being 'The View's only conservative voice Being the only conservative voice on the panel also has its down sides.\u00a0McCain said she's often scapegoated for President Donald Trump's actions. \"I get that you\u2019re angry that Trump\u2019s president, like a lot of people are, but I don\u2019t think yelling at me is gonna fix the problem,\" McCain said to Behar during an argument over one of Trump's rallies. McCain dubbed herself the show's \"sacrificial Republican.\" More:Meghan McCain hurls harsh words at Joy Behar on 'The View' After saying on CNN in January that she no longer self-identifies as a Republican,\u00a0McCain clarified her political views \u2013 where else but on \"The View.\" \"I said I consider myself a conservative first and foremost\u00a0before being a Republican\u00a0\u2013 which, by the way, people like Ted Cruz say all the time\u00a0\u2013 then I also said I'm still in the party and l vote Republican and I will going forward. But Trump gets nothing from me,\" she said, rehashing\u00a0her interview with Van Jones. McCain continued: \"That somehow got\u00a0interpreted as I have led this mass exodus out of the Republican party. It's not true at all: I am still a Republican. But not voting for Trump doesn't necessarily mean you're no longer\u00a0a conservative.\" 'I consider myself a conservative first':Meghan McCain clarifies her politics In her eulogy at\u00a0her father\u2019s memorial in Washington, D.C., in September 2018,\u00a0McCain took a direct jab at President Trump and his campaign motto, without repeating it. \u201cThe America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great,\u201d she said.

Cindy McCain, his widow, also remembers a hawk that nested on their property each year, swooping across the lush grass. It landed on a nearby tree, facing the senator\u2019s family. \u201cAnd that was it,\u201d she recalled this week\u00a0in a den adorned with political memorabilia inside her north-central Phoenix home. Their life together had ended after nearly 39 years of marriage, raising kids, welcoming grandchildren, traveling the world, grinding through two presidential races and six runs for the Senate, and facing the searing scrutiny of public life. Before he died, they talked about what this would look like. She knew what steps needed to be done. But she wasn\u2019t prepared for how difficult it would be to do it alone. Meghan McCain: Meghan McCain to release audiobook next year discussing dad John McCain, politics She would return to the central Phoenix neighborhood where she grew up, a familiar place just off the sandy bridal path shaded by giant trees. When she wasn't with their kids, she would be working to grow the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University, the foreign-policy think tank that bears her husband's name. It\u2019s still difficult to return to the family's\u00a0home in Cornville. Happy memories have, at least temporarily, been overshadowed by more painful ones. Even as she tries to heal by filling her time with work to carry on her husband\u2019s legacy, she is helping her children cope with the loss of their father. \"My job is to make sure they\u2019re OK\u00a0 \u2014 that\u2019s my job,\" McCain said. \"I have gotten calls in the middle of the night. I\u2019ve gotten calls from ones I didn\u2019t ever think that they would call me \u2026 Each situation is different.\" The family lost its patriarch. The world, she said, lost a voice of reason. The retired Navy captain and Vietnam prisoner of war had become a fixture in American and global politics before his death Aug. 25, 2018, at the age of 81. When he spoke to condemn the incivility and dysfunction that permeates American politics today, his voice was widely accepted as a counterweight to the combative style of politics and leadership embraced by President Donald Trump. John McCain: Sen. John McCain, American 'maverick' and political giant, dies at 81 After burying her husband at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland, she became chair of the McCain Institute. She is working to expand and develop new programs to combat human trafficking around the world, to develop new leaders in the mold of her husband, and to advance human rights and democracy by encouraging people to vote. At the same time, she is working with ASU to construct a John McCain library, which would house his artifacts, writings and memorabilia. She envisions a research institute on par with presidential libraries that can host presidential debates. In her mind, McCain sees a building with high glass to encourage open discussion. The desert terrain is perfect for an outdoor path for walking, she said, and she wants to work with a wildlife rehabilitation center as part of the project. A replica of the type of plane he was shot down in while flying a combat mission over North Vietnam, an A-4E Skyhawk, could hang from the ceiling. McCain hopes to break ground within the next two years, depending on funding. McCain funeral: Meghan McCain says father's 'America was always great' during speech at National Cathedral To commemorate the anniversary of her husband\u2019s death, she is asking Americans to perform an act of civility and post about it on social media with the hashtag #ActsOfCivility. This could mean sitting down for a conversation with someone you disagree with or volunteering alongside someone you disagree with for a cause that benefits others. This week, McCain plans on visiting elderly people at a local care facility where her mom once lived. McCain mentioned the recent mass shootings when talking about the civility campaign. \u201cI\u2019m no different from anybody else who lives here: I\u2019m worried about our country right now,\u201d she said. \u201cHow many shootings have we had, just in a two-week period? \u2026 I\u2019m concerned about that as a parent, as a grandmother, as a citizen. \u201c... I would like people to take a step back and just remember: An act of civility can change someone\u2019s life.\u201d McCain said she is troubled by the rhetoric surrounding immigrants and minorities. Investigators are treating the mass shootings in California and in El Paso as domestic terrorism. While the motive in the California shooting at a garlic festival remains unclear, the suspect in the Texas shooting posted a racist screed online and admitted to police that he traveled to El Paso to target Latinos. \u201cWe are a country of diversity. We\u2019re a country that has succeeded because of our diversity,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t have problems \u2014 we do. But we are rich in heritage, right here in Arizona because\u00a0of our Hispanic culture.\u201d Cindy McCain: Cindy McCain responds to report her family supports Biden in 2020, has 'no intention' to get involved Condemning anti-immigrant rhetoric, McCain added: \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong and it offends me as an American, and it offends me as John\u2019s wife, as a McCain. He stood\u00a0for so much more than that. And our country is better than that.\u201d She declined to comment directly about the president\u2019s attacks over the past year on her husband, and his rhetoric. \u201cMy message is more to my family and to my community and to the people that loved John and people that loved him but didn\u2019t vote for him,\u201d she said. She likes to remind people of the moment during the 2008 campaign when the senator, who was running against Barack Obama for the presidency, corrected a woman at a town hall who said she couldn\u2019t trust Obama because he was \u201can Arab.\u201d \u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d John McCain said. \u201cHe\u2019s a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues and that\u2019s what this campaign is all about.\u201d His wife said:\u00a0\u201cI would have expected nothing less for him \u2026 I would hope people would remember things like that.\u201d McCain and Trump: What's driving Donald Trump's feud with John McCain? War record, Obamacare among the themes This new chapter brings new traditions for McCain. A baby is coming. A boy, the first child of their youngest son, Jimmy. She hopes he will be born on Aug. 29, her husband's birthday. \"I think he looks like John,\" she said of a sonogram photo of the baby that hangs on a wall near the kitchen. On the eve of the anniversary of her husband's death, McCain will host a party with close friends and family to celebrate her husband. Last year around this time, the family threw a \u201cGreat Gatsby\u201d-themed party at the cabin to say goodbye to him, knowing the end was near. A year later:\u00a0Jack McCain reflects on his father's death \u201cWhat he asked me to do after that, was, \u2018Every year, I want you to have a party \u2026 and I want you to celebrate. No one\u2019s gonna cry, no one\u2019s gonna be upset,\u2019\u201d she recalled him saying. The kids groaned, she said, when they found out he wanted his playlist \u2014 filled with Linda Ronstadt, Andy Williams and Frank Sinatra \u2014 on repeat. They will toast him with a version of the Gibson, a martini-like cocktail\u00a0with an onion. (He hated olives). They will celebrate his birthday with family, friends and former McCain staffers\u00a0on Aug. 29 at a local restaurant. He would have turned 83 this month. Looking ahead toward\u00a02020, Cindy McCain says she doesn\u2019t expect to get involved in politics. A special election for the Senate seat once held by her husband could determine which party controls the Senate. \"I think I\u2019m going to sit back and kind of see what happens,\" she said. \"We\u2019re still trying to put our family back together.\" Have news to share about Arizona's U.S. senators or national politics?\u00a0Reach the reporter on Twitter and Facebook.

Lindsey Graham's now-close relations with President Donald Trump. McCain said she is \"doing OK,\" but could not offer the same sense for America, saying that her husband, who famously feuded with Trump, would be most upset by what is happening in immigration and border security these days. \"Our country is not\u00a0well right now,\" she said. \"We need to get our act together, No. 1, and step back and take a breath. This country is made up of immigrants. We're made up of people of every color, every creed and that's what makes us special. \"John would be very discouraged about the border situation right now. He would also be the voice of reason in all of this, which is what we're sorely lacking right now,\" she added. \"I\u00a0don't see anyone carrying the voice-of-reason mantle right now. I'm hoping someone will bubble up.\" McCain could not offer encouraging words about the Republican Party, either. She said the GOP is not the party of former Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Even so, McCain, who last week called for acts of civility touted on social media as a tribute to her husband, tried to sound an optimistic tone for the future. John McCain: Biography of Arizona's senator and political maverick \"I\u00a0believe this pendulum is going to swing back,\" she said. \"I\u00a0don't know when,\u00a0but I\u00a0just don't believe we're going to stick right here on the side that's just disruptive and mean and non-progressive in any way.\" McCain said she remained friends with her husband's colleagues in the Senate, but reacted coolly when asked specifically about Graham, R-S.C., who was often McCain's sidekick in the Senate, but who has more recently emerged as a reliable booster for Trump. He is up for re-election next year. \"Lindsey has his own political career to worry about and his own political life,\" McCain said. \"I\u00a0would just hope that in the long run everyone would begin to move in the right direction, including Lindsey or anybody else. Lindsey's a part of my family. He's a good friend and I\u00a0cannot and will not be critical\u00a0of Lindsey.\" For his part, Graham, in an interview Sunday with CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" was respectful of McCain and her family and remained steadfast in his support of Trump. Asked about the lack of civility that McCain has cited, Graham said: \"It's a rough-and-tumble America, but America's always been pretty rough-and-tumble.\" \"Cindy McCain has taken over his job for the family. Nobody was ever better taken care of in an illness than Cindy provided care to John,\" Graham added. \"She's doing a great job on her own, in (fighting) human trafficking, and to the four boys and three daughters, they're doing great. They miss their dad. I\u00a0miss him, but my job is to carry on and help this president where I\u00a0can and I\u00a0will.\" Reach the reporter Ronald J.

      "content": " Following President Donald Trump targeting singer John Legend and TV/social media personality Chrissy Teigen online Sunday night, Meghan McCain has taken a side. The daughter of late Republican Sen. John McCain, who serves as a conservative voice on \"The View,\" showed support for Teigen the day after Trump slammed her and Legend on Twitter. \"Since when is there something wrong with being a filthy mouthed wife?\" McCain tweeted Monday, referencing the words the president used to describe Teigen. \"#teamchrissy\" Trump began tweeting about the celebrity\u00a0couple after Legend was featured in\u00a0MSNBC's final installment of Lester Holt's \"Justice For All\" series, a report about the criminal justice system. Sunday's report included an interview with Legend discussing his organization Free America, which aims to \"amplify the voices of individuals impacted by the criminal justice system and those who are working to change it,\" according to the official website. Trump complained Sunday night that \"people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform... came to me as a group and asked for my help,\" but now isn't getting any credit, seemingly referring to the First Step Act he signed into law in December, which allows prisoners to get more days removed from their sentences for good behavior. \"Guys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed,\" Trump tweeted.\u00a0\"'Anchor'\u00a0@LesterHoltNBC doesn\u2019t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about the importance or passage of Criminal Justice Reform. They only talk about the minor players, or people that had nothing to do with it...And the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed, all they talk about now is Impeaching President Trump!\" The final part of Holt's report,\u00a0which originally aired Friday and re-played Sunday night before a\u00a0town hall event, gave\u00a0Trump credit for signing the First Step Act, acknowledging\u00a0its potential to reduce sentences for thousands of nonviolent offenders in federal prisons. It also noted that the bill doesn't help over 90% of people in US prisons at the state and local levels. Teigen and Legend are frequent, outspoken critics of Trump\u00a0\u2013 the couple marked his 72nd birthday last year by donating a $72,000 check from every person in their family to the ACLU, for a total of $288,000 from Teigen, Legend, and their two children, Luna, 3,\u00a0and Miles, 1. \"lol what a (expletive). tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president,\" Teigen tweeted, repeatedly calling the president a three-word expletive and referring to his tweets as his \"9th meltdown of the day.\" She added: \"the absolute best part of his tweet is I literally didn't speak in the special, nor was I mentioned. I'm cackling at the pointless addition of me because he cannot not be a (expletive).\" Legend also chimed in: \"Imagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody--ANYBODY--will praise you. Melania, please praise this man. He needs you. \"Your country needs you, Melania,\" he added, before retweeting a photo of the first lady smiling while leaning in to greet Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G-7 summit that previously had the hashtag #MelaniaLovesTrudeau trending. \"Ah yes, Melania is otherwise occupied. My apologies, @realDonaldTrump,\" Legend wrote. Fox News host Laura Ingraham mocks Chrissy Teigen,\u00a0star claps back with fiery tweets",

      "author": "EJ Montini",
      "content": " The closed door statements made by senators voting in the impeachment trial of former President Bill Clinton were published in the Congressional Record in 1999. So while we can't\u00a0ask the late Sen. John McCain what he thinks about the actions of President Donald Trump, we can, through McCain\u2019s statement on Clinton, understand what he expected of a president and what, in McCain\u2019s mind, should cause a president to be removed from office. Every Republican in the Senate should read McCain\u2019s statement, particularly the person gifted McCain\u2019s seat, Sen. Martha McSally. McCain voted to convict Clinton. He says early in his statement, \u201cIndeed, I take no satisfaction at all from this vote, with one exception \u2013 and an important exception it is \u2013 that by voting to convict I have been spared reproach by my conscience for shirking my duty.\u201d The senator then speaks about the rationale used by Clinton\u2019s defenders, who said that the articles of impeachment against Clinton did not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors but were offenses, as McCain put it, \u201ccommitted to cover up private not public misconduct.\u201d McCain understood the argument, but wasn\u2019t buying it. He said, \u201cThis, too, is an appealing rationalization for acquittal. But it is just that, a rationalization. Nowhere in the Constitution or in the expressed views of our founders are crimes intended to conceal the President's character flaws distinguished from crimes intended to subvert democracy. What they owe us: Trump is in free fall. We need insights on his fitness from Mattis, Kelly and others. Now. \u201cThe President thwarted justice. No matter how unfair he or we may view a process that forces a President to disclose his own failings, we should not excuse or fail to punish in the constitutionally prescribed manner evidence that the President has deliberately thwarted the course of justice.\u201d Weird, isn\u2019t it? The same kind of \u201crationalization\u201d is being used these days by Republicans looking to protect President Donald Trump. They say Trump\u2019s alleged transgressions are more a reflection of character flaws than impeachable offenses. It's similar to the argument Clinton's defenders used. McCain wasn't having it. He said, \u201cI\u00a0have done things in my private life that I am not proud of. I suspect many of us have. But we are not asked to judge the President's character flaws. We are asked to judge whether the President, who swore an oath to faithfully execute his office, deliberately subverted \u2013 for whatever purpose \u2013 the rule of law.\u201d The time for waiting is over:\u00a0The House must move on Trump impeachment articles now. That\u2019s the heart of it, as far as McCain is concerned. The president's\u00a0sworn oath. He said, \u201cAll of my life, I have been instructed never to swear an oath to my country in vain. In my former profession, those who violated their sworn oath were punished severely and considered outcasts from our society. \u201cI do not hold the President to the same standard that I hold military officers to. I hold him to a higher standard. Although I may admit to failures in my private life, I have at all times, and to the best of my ability, kept faith with every oath I have ever sworn to this country. I have known some men who kept that faith at the cost of their lives.\u201d McCain also brushed off the argument \u2013 like one we hear from Trump apologists today \u2013 that no ordinary citizen would be treated the way\u00a0the president is being treated. McCain said of this, \u201cNo, an ordinary citizen would not be treated as the President has been treated. But ordinary citizens don't enforce the laws for the rest of us. Ordinary citizens don't have the world's mightiest armed forces at their command. Ordinary citizens do not usually have the opportunity to be figures of historical importance.\" He continued, \u201cPresidents are not ordinary citizens. They are extraordinary, in that they are vested with so much more authority and power than the rest of us. We have a right; indeed, we have an obligation, to hold them strictly accountable to the rule of law.\u201d Imagine that. An obligation to hold the president strictly accountable. When was the last time Trump was held \u201cstrictly accountable\u201d for \u2026 anything? Even worse, when was the last time McCain\u2019s former Republican colleagues fulfilled their obligation?
