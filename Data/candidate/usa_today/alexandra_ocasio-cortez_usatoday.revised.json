Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezresponded Tuesday to criticism from\u00a0a Republican congressman by saying he lied about her\u00a0and asking for civility in their shared workplace of the House of Representatives. Ocasio-Cortez chided Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., writing on Twitter that Hice was \"lying about this.\" \"We\u2019re going to see each other at work & you\u2019re going to pretend to be nice to me. Passive aggression. It\u2019s a lifestyle,\" she continued, adding the thumbs-up emoji at the end of the tweet. Hice had accused her of having \"deliberately misled the American people\" about the treatment of migrants in detention. Ocasio-Cortez had previously said migrants in Border Patrol custody were held in substandard conditions and \"forced to drink out of toilets.\" Hice disagreed. In the first of two videos posted on Twitter on Monday, Hice drank out of one of the combined drinking fountains and toilets at the center of controversy. \"There's drinkable water within this toilet system, AOC is giving fallacious information, here's the truth,\" Hice said, after drinking from it. In another video,\u00a0Hice visited a warehouse he called a \"miniature Walmart,\" full of basic necessities like socks, toothbrushes, and clothing for detained migrants. The disagreement stemmed from comments Ocasio-Cortez had made after a visit to a Border Patrol facility at the beginning of July.\u00a0On July 1, after touring the facility, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted to say Border Patrol officers were telling detained migrant women\u00a0 \"to drink out of the toilets,\" sparking a social media firestorm.

A day later, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a picture of the toilet to explain that the sink portion of the toilet\u00a0wasn't working on the day when she and other members of Congress toured the Border Patrol facility.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,\u00a0and illegal possession of ammunition. Ireland was charged with \"one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, one count of being a fugitive in possession of a firearm and one count of making interstate threats,\" according to\u00a0the Department of Justice. According to the criminal complaint, at the end of July, the U.S. Capitol Police received a report from a person who'd perceived a Facebook post from\u00a0Timothy J. Ireland, Jr. as potentially threatening against Ocasio-Cortez.

On August 2, the Capitol Police called Ireland at a number found in public records and asked him if he made the post and if he owned firearms. The Capitol Police said Ireland told them he was \"very proud of that post he made,\" and admitted to owning firearms. Six days later, Capitol Police and the\u00a0Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents searched Ireland's house after obtaining a search warrant. They detained him at the scene and\u00a0found seven rounds of ammunition inside his kitchen drawers\u00a0\u2013 three rounds of .32 caliber ammunition and four rounds of .45 caliber ammunition. Ireland told agents he did not have a gun in his house but brought ammunition with him when he\u00a0moved into the house. An FBI criminal background check of Ireland found\u00a0he had two outstanding warrants for failure to appear charges in Florida and Georgia, which stemmed\u00a0from a marijuana possession charge. The criminal complaint noted\u00a0Ireland had\u00a0also been convicted in 1996 of four felony counts of dealing in stolen property in Sarasota County, Fla. \u201cThere is absolutely no place in the marketplace of ideas for threats of violence against any person, especially those who are elected to represent the American people,\u201d U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman said in a press release. \u201cDisagreement on political issues cannot lead to acts of violence, and if it does, we will seek federal prison time.\u201d More: Louisiana police officer's Facebook post says Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 'needs a round,' report says Ocasio-Cortez has been outspokenabout the number of threats that she receives as a high-profile member of Congress. \"I\u2018ve had mornings where I wake up & the 1st thing I do w/ my coffee is review photos of the men (it\u2019s always men) who want to kill me,\" she wrote on Twitter at the end of May.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez exchanged words on Twitter on Thursday night after the president sent out a storm of tweets lashing out at AOC, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, \u201cDo Nothing Democrats\u201d and the media. \u201cAOC is Wack Job!\u201d Trump\u00a0tweeted. She responded: \"Better than being a criminal who betrays our country.\u201d That was only one of Trump's tweets. \u201cAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d Trump said on the same day he declared that China\u00a0should investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. With the tweet, Trump again emphasized that he doesn't see wrongdoing in asking\u00a0foreign governments to dig up dirt on his political opponents, though the head of the Federal Election Commission reminded candidates earlier Thursday that asking for help from foreign governments is illegal in an apparent subtweet of Trump. Trump's tweet caught the attention of one Democratic representative, California's Katie Hill, who responded on Twitter: \"Dude, no. No. Nope. No. Just no.\" Later, Trump threatened\u00a0to \u201csue\u201d Pelosi for saying \u201cthat Adam Schiffty Schiff didn\u2019t fabricate my words in a major speech before Congress\u201d while further describing that it is \"always tough to beat the \u201cPress,\u201d but people are beginning to see how totally CORRUPT they are, and it makes our job a whole lot easier!\" The president tweeted eight times within one hour. California senator and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris has called for Trump's Twitter account to be suspended.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A fringe political group claimed responsibility for a strange stunt at a town hall speech by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was interrupted repeatedly by a woman who boisterously claimed people need to save the planet by \"eating babies.\" The woman, who had taken off her jacket to reveal a T-shirt that read \u201cSave the planet. Eat the children,\u201d was acting on behalf of the political group LaRouchePAC, the group tweeted Thursday night.. Video shows the woman continuing to raise\u00a0her voice as Ocasio-Cortez shows little reaction. The woman goes on, saying, \u201cEven if we would bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution, so we have to get rid of the babies. Just stopping having babies is not enough; we need to eat the babies.\u201d The freshman New York Congresswoman attempted to regain control of the room by largely ignoring the outburst, saying, \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s very important to us is that we need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present. Luckily, we have more than a few months.\u201d The woman tried to interrupt again and was escorted from the room. A Twitter account belonging to the LaRouchePAC, a\u00a0group that has supported\u00a0President Donald Trump, claimed responsibility. The group was created\u00a0by Lyndon LaRouche Jr.,\u00a0until he died in February at the age of 96. He was a cult-like figure, who espoused a wide range of conspiracy theories and advocated for an overhaul of the world\u2019s economic and financial systems. He ran for president in every election from 1976 to 2004, including a campaign waged from federal prison. The outburst at the town hall spurred a flurry of conservatives,\u00a0including the president, using the comments against Ocasio-Cortez, . \u201cAOC is Wack Job!\u201d Trump tweeted, re-tweeting his son commenting on the ordeal.\u00a0She responded: \"Better than being a criminal who betrays our country.\u201d In response to the woman's outburst, originally\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez reprimanded critics for attempting to \u201cmock or make a spectacle\u201d of the woman who \u201cmay have been suffering from a mental condition\u2026 Be a decent human being and knock it off.\u201d #EatTheBabies and #EatTheChildren were\u00a0trending on twitter by\u00a0Friday morning. Ocasio-Cortez then\u00a0responded Friday\u00a0that although the woman was a\u00a0\"Trump supporter,\"\u00a0it \u201cdoesn\u2019t rule out potential mental issue (Drs do that) but good to know they were not in crisis.\u201d LaRouche followers do not believe in climate change\u00a0and often refer to global warming as \u201cpopulation reduction, not science.\u201d His conspiracy theories included a claim that the International Monetary Fund was \u201cengaged in mass murder\u201d by spreading AIDS through its economic policies, that former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Vice President Walter Mondale were Soviet \u201cagents of influence\u201d and that the Queen of England was involved in the drug trade.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. weighed in on D.C. statehood during a Thursday hearing on the issue and discussed the \"disenfranchisement\" of the District's people as rooted in the \"history of slavery.\" She opened her statement by talking about her family's roots in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, and how her family had lacked the right to vote in federal elections. \"I wish that upon no citizen of the United States of America,\" she said. \"Where the disenfranchisement of Puerto Ricans was rooted in the colonialist and imperialistic history that we've had in policies of the United States, the issue of D.C. statehood is\u00a0rooted in a different evil in our history, which is the history of slavery in the United States,\u201d she added. Ocasio-Cortez cited the disenfranchisement of the\u00a0majority-minority city as \"upholding the injustice of the practices enacted during slavery.\" \"It is a profound injustice and a thick irony of our history that the people who fled here to the District of Columbia to free slavery because of the enlightenment of this community are now disenfranchised,\" she said, observing that the District was the first part of the Union to emancipate slaves. The hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform was to debate a D.C. statehood\u00a0bill, aptly named \"H.R. 51,\" in the first House of Representatives hearing on statehood since 1993. How does statehood work?: Will DC become the 51st state? Advocates to make their case in Congress with boost from Elizabeth Warren Other debate in the hearing surrounded practical matters like the governance of buildings like the Trump International Hotel, which is in a building still owned by the federal government, but would be included within the boundaries of the new state. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., asked about its fate. D.C. Mayor Muriel\u00a0Bowser told him that all hotels would be included in the new state. The question drew derision from Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who joked that the hotel was the \"Washington Monument.\" \"It's amazing to me that the political rights of 700,000 people might be conditioned on the business interests of one man,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.",

A person with knowledge of the plans confirmed the endorsement. The Washington Post had first reported the planned endorsement. Nina Turner, a former state senator and current\u00a0Sanders campaign national co-chair, said to The USA TODAY Network that Ocasio-Cortez was returning the favor for the groundwork Sanders' campaign had laid in 2016. \"So the foundation that he laid in 2016 allowed for candidates to stand up and be bold and run their race,\" Turner said.\u00a0\"This is coming full circle. One person doesn't make or break a campaign, but the level of excitement, it's going to take it to the next level for us.\" Later in the evening, Rep. Ilhan Omar, another member of the group of progressive House freshmen colloquially known as \"the Squad\" announced her endorsement of Sanders. Omar cited Sanders' leadership of a \"working class movement to defeat Donald Trump,\" and his leadership on other major progressive issues \u2013 \"And it\u2019s why I believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020,\" she said in a release.

Bernie Sanders for president came as he took the stage alongside his 2020 rivals and showed he was still in the game after a health scare. But Sanders got the news from the New York representative herself as he was still recovering in the hospital from a heart attack earlier this month, according to a new report. Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, told\u00a0Politico\u00a0he answered the phone that day and passed it over to Sanders, who was in his hospital bed. \"Think about the courage of this person who says, \u2018You know, I know what you just went through but I have so much trust and confidence in you that you are the one who will fight the fight that I believe in.

      "content": "All 12\u00a0leading Democratic candidates for president got a chance to demonstrate why they were able to meet the requirements to pack on the stage for the fourth debate Tuesday. Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts stayed feisty and focused in her new role as front-runner. Former Vice President Joe Biden was optimistic and self-congratulatory as he tried to win the John McCain name-dropping contest. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii confounded everyone by spreading the blame for the slaughter of the Kurds in northern Syria that Donald Trump invited to members of \u201cboth parties.\u201d And Andrew Yang got to say lots of things as if no one had ever thought of them before. But the winner of the night was older than the two youngest candidates on stage \u2014 Gabbard, 38, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 37 \u2014 combined. Vermont Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders, 78, returned to the campaign trail after recovering from a heart attack to deliver his strongest debate performance of the campaign. He was lively, funny and persuasive. At one\u00a0point, he even seemed to convince billionaire Tom Steyer that billionaires shouldn\u2019t exist. Sanders also took on Biden\u2019s constant praise of bipartisanship and his pointed boast, \u201cI'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done.\u201d \u201cJoe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut you know what you also got done \u2014 and I say this as a good friend \u2014 you got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements like NAFTA and PNTR (permanent normal trade relations)\u00a0with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs. Now, let's get to 'Medicare for All.' ... If we stood together, we could create the greatest health care system in the world.\u201d A conservative's take: Winners and losers in the Democratic debate from columnist Glenn Harlan Reynolds But Bernie\u2019s biggest moment of the night didn\u2019t happen onstage. In the closing minutes of the debate, news broke that one of the brightest young stars on America\u2019s left, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York,\u00a0will endorse the 2016 Democratic primary runner-up this weekend. This gives the democratic socialist from Vermont the chance to break the momentum of Warren\u2019s steady rise in the polls, though he notably hasn\u2019t taken a shot at the senator from Massachusetts on the debate stage yet. Instead, he sided with her several times as she was cornered, echoing her arguments for systemic change. The format of the debate flowed much better than the previous three. It\u2019s unclear whether\u00a0this\u00a0was because the moderators allowed the candidates more air to answer and rebut each other, or because self-help guru Marianne Williamson wasn\u2019t on the stage. Whatever it is, they should do more of it. While there are still miles to go before anyone actually votes for a nominee, the race for the chance to oppose Trump will likely remain a tossup among\u00a0Sanders, Warren and Biden. This is mostly because the rest of the candidates have done a better job of canceling each other out than breaking through. While the debates have led to some blips in the polls \u2014 most notably for Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris of California after the second debate \u2014 the crowded stage format has the effect of blurring candidates together, especially since every debate seems to rehash the same Medicare for All contentions over and over until even Sanders seems a little bored by the fray. Another huge winner of the night was impeachment, which is now polling\u00a050%. Every candidate on stage backs the inquiry in the House, and no candidate showed any willingness to echo the attacks on Hunter Biden that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into trumping up. Unfortunately, the biggest loser of the night was human civilization. While there was a question about Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 defense of her kindness to former president and torture purveyor George W. Bush, there wasn\u2019t one question about climate change. Future generations will have to be satisfied\u00a0knowing that we were much too busy worrying about rich people getting along in luxury boxes to stop the planet from boiling.
