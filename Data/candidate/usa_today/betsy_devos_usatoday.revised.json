      "content": "     WASHINGTON \u2013 Ten Democrats running for president slugged their way through a three-hour debate Thursday that featured sharp\u00a0jabs and underscored deep divisions among the candidates hoping to take on President Donald Trump next fall. In a debate that put all of the leading candidates on the same stage for the first time, the top tier candidates in polling \u2013 namely, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 largely fended off early and sometimes fiery attacks from the lesser-known Democrats. Ultimately, there were\u00a0few breakout moments to shake up the status of the race. \"It's no longer time to postpone,\" Biden said in Houston. \"We should get moving.\" Amy Klobuchar, Julian Castro and Beto O'Rourke were among the candidates seeking to target Biden, who has held a steady lead in polls for months. But there were few fireworks among the front runners, and the long-expected sparks between Biden and Warren, who has been climbing in polls, never fully materialized. The debate highlighted deep chasms within the Democratic Party, including on health care. Some of those differences were framed by Barack Obama's presidency, though most of the candidates praised the direction he took the country over eight years. Sanders and Warren continued their push for a Medicare-for-All health care system while others, such as Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Klobuchar, questioned the cost. \u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill,\u201d Klobuchar fired at Sanders, arguing his plan would force millions of Americans off their health plans. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bold idea, I think it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d Though the candidates were quick to criticize Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d decision on trade, they were less willing to denounce tariffs he has imposed on China. Throughout the debate, Biden tied himself closely to Obama, whose approach to healthcare, immigration and foreign policy were dissected by the candidates almost as much as Trump\u2019s. But when Biden was pressed to answer for the high level of deportations under Obama, he demurred by noting that he was only the vice president. That answer drew a sharp rebuke from Julian Castro. \u201cHe wants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work but not have to answer any questions,\u201d Castro said. Biden shot back that he stood by Obama\u2019s decisions \u201cgood, bad and indifferent.\u201d While the Democrats were hashing out how to defeat Trump, the president was on a stage in Baltimore mocking front runners with his trademark scathing nicknames. \"I hit Pocahontas way too early,\" Trump said of Warren as he spoke with GOP lawmakers meeting for their annual retreat. \"I thought she was gone \u2013 she\u2019s emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she can beat Sleepy Joe.\u201d With less than five months to go before the Iowa caucuses, the knock-down battle for the nomination has remained remarkably steady. Biden has held a consistent lead in polling \u2013 both nationwide and in Iowa \u2013 for months. Warren has gained on Sanders, who remains in second place in most national polls. The candidates \u2013 at least some of them \u2013 will do it all over again next month. The fourth Democratic presidential debate will take place in Ohio on Oct. 15. After plenty of Trump-bashing, Vice President Mike Pence got a reference when the candidates were asked at the end of the debate to talk about a significant setback and how they dealt with it. Buttigieg talked about his struggles with coming out as gay as he was facing re-election in Indiana when Pence was governor. The Pence reference got a brief rise out of the audience, which quickly quieted as Buttigieg talked about coming back from serving in Afghanistan. His deployment had made him realize that you only get one life. \u201cI was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I just came out.\u201d The fact that he was re-elected to a second term as mayor with 80% of the vote taught Buttigieg that \u201cpart of how you can win, and deserve to win, is to know what\u2019s worth more to you than winning.\u201d --Maureen Groppe Joe Biden was briefly shouted down by audience members during a question about his professional setbacks. Biden began saying that he didn\u2019t believe any of his professional setbacks were significant when members of the audience began shouting. It was not immediately clear what issues the protesters, who shouted over each other, \u00a0were raising. Biden appeared to turn to Warren to ask if she knew what the audience members were yelling about. Biden continued his remarks a few minutes later. \u201cYou deal with it by finding purpose,\u201d Biden said of setbacks. And his purpose, he said, was to stay engaged in politics. -- John Fritze Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a big Democratic boogeyman, became an applause line for Buttigieg. The first step in improving education, he said, is appointing a secretary of education \"who actually believes in public education.\u201d DeVos is a major advocate of charter schools. Buttigieg, whose husband is a teacher, also said that the country needs to respect teachers \u201cthe way \u00a0we do soldiers and pay them the way we do doctors.\u201d Warren, calling herself the only one on stage who has been a teacher, said her secretary of education would be a public school teacher. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t really comment on the debate,\u201d tweeted Chasten Buttigieg, \u201cbut I am SO GLAD we are *finally* talking about education and teachers.\u201d --Maureen Groppe Beto O\u2019Rourke promised to spend $5 trillion over the next decade on technology and incentives to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Amy Klobuchar vowed to keep the United States in the Paris Climate Accord, restore Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan to lower greenhouse gas emissions and increase fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. And Elizabeth Warren said she\u2019s embracing a plan proposed by former presidential candidate Jay Inslee to eliminate carbon emissions from new buildings by 2028, carbon emissions from new cars by 2030, and carbon emissions from power production by 2035. \u201cWe are running out of time,\u201d she said. It took two hours before the candidates were asked about climate change, an issue Klobuchar called \u201cthe existential crisis of our time.\u201d And it was a dud. Everyone who chimed in agreed with the need for dramatic, immediate action. --Ledyard King Kamala Harris compared Donald Trump\u2019s trade strategy to the Wizard of Oz. And not in a good way. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a guy in the White House who\u2019s been erratic on trade policy,\u201d the California senator said about the president\u2019s trade policy with China. \u201cHe conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly borne out of his fragile ego.\u201d She called for a more consistent trade policy and made a reference to the iconic 1939 movie that starred Judy Garland. More: Republicans air ad about the dangers of 'socialism' and AOC during the Democratic debate \u201cThe bottom line is this: Donald Trump in office on trade policy \u2026 reminds me of that guy in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, when you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude.\u201d That drew a chuckle from ABC moderator George Stephanopoulos, a diminutive man whose height is listed as 5 feet and five inches. \u201cOK,\u201d Stephanopoulos dead-panned. \u201cI\u2019m not going to even take the bait, Sen. Harris.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about you,\u201d she said laughing as well. -- Ledyard King Booker referenced his bald pate in attacking Trump for using a national security waiver to impose tariffs on Canada, a country led by a prime minister with a healthy head of hair. \u201cI\u2019m the only person on this stage that finds (Justin) Trudeau\u2019s hair very menacing,\u201d Booker said, \u201cbut they are not a national security threat.\u201d Booker\u2019s larger point was that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy has turned into an \u201cAmerica alone\u201d policy in which he is pulling away from allies, making it harder to take on competitors like China. --Maureen Groppe One by one, the Democratic candidates slammed President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policy, which they described as \u201cerratic.\u201d \u201cThe president clearly has no strategy,\u201d Pete Buttigieg said. More: Trump may not be watching the debate, but his team is. Campaign defends record in emails Buttigieg recalled that when he entered the race, Trump derisively said he\u2019d like to see Buttigieg make a deal with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. \u201cI\u2019d like to see HIM making a deal with Xi Jinping,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cIs it just me, or was that supposed to happen in, like, April?\u201d Buttigieg said that Trump\u2019s inability to follow through on what he promises is being taken note of by both competitors and allies with serious consequences. \u201cWe can use trade to help build a stronger economy,\u201d Elizabeth Warren said. Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican first\u201d policy is actually an \u201cAmerican alone\u201d policy, Corey Booker said. What they didn\u2019t say: Whether they would be willing to eliminate the tariffs that Trump has slapped on Chinese imports as leverage designed to force China to agree to a new trade pact. Amy Klobuchar came the closest. She said she would not have imposed the tariffs in the first place. --Michael Collins, Maureen Groppe During a busy night of Republican response to debating Democrats, President Donald Trump first took a low-key approach by saying he respected his opponents \u2013 but later mocked frontrunners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren with scathing nicknames. \"I hit Pocahontas way too early,\" Trump said, referring to Warren while speaking to a group of House Republicans in Baltimore. \"I thought she was gone \u2013 she\u2019s emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she can beat Sleepy Joe (Biden) ... He has no idea what\u2019s going on.\" Trump also threw in a jab at South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg: \u201cHe\u2019s doing a rotten job running his own city.\u201d As the president spoke in Baltimore, Democrats who debated in Houston accused Trump of fomenting racism by attacking people of color and denouncing immigrants as invaders. Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke described Trump as a \"white supremacist\" who poses a \"mortal threat\" to the country, particularly minorities. -- David Jackson Dissecting President Barack Obama and his administration\u2019s record has become a central theme of the Democratic presidential debate. It started, during the first hour, with health care, as the candidates sought to chart a direction on what to do with Obamacare. It continued during a discussion on immigration, when Joe Biden was pressed directly on the administration\u2019s record on deportations. Obama adopted many progressive policies on immigration, including allowing young people brought to the country illegally as children to avoid deportation. But his administration also deported immigrants in the country illegally at a rate that surprised fellow Democrats. Biden was pressed directly on whether he stood by those deportations. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lock people in cages, we didn\u2019t separate families,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have served with him.\u201d But when questioned again specifically about deportations, Biden noted that he was only the vice president at that time. That drew a fiery response from Julian Castro. \u201cHe wants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work but not have to answer any questions,\u201d Castro said. Biden dismissed that criticism, arguing that he \u201cstood with\u201d Obama\u2019s decisions for eight years, \u201cgood, bad and indifferent.\u201d \u201cI did not say I did not stand with him,\u201d Biden said. -- John Fritze President Donald Trump may not be watching the Democratic presidential debate, but his people are. The Trump campaign\u2019s rapid response team is firing off emails to reporters in defense of his record as Democrats go after him from the stage. \u201cPresident Trump is addressing gun safety while defending the 2nd Amendment,\u201d read one message sent just minutes after Democrats slammed Trump failing to take on the issue of gun violence. \u201cThanks to President Trump, black Americans are making historic progress and enjoying growing opportunities,\u201d read another rebuttal when Democrats accused him of promoting racism. \u201cPresident Trump is fighting to bring down prescription drug prices for working families,\u201d said another message when Democrats blasted Trump for trying to undo the Affordable Care Act. --Michael Collins Sanders, rather than attacking the candidate with whom he is competing for the most liberal voters, grabbed at the chance to reiterate their joint call that the system is broken. On the issue of gun control, Warren has said it can\u2019t be addressed \u201cuntil we attack the systematic problems.\u201d Asked a question about the Senate filibuster, Sanders said he wanted to get back to Warren\u2019s point. \u201cWhat we are looking at is a corrupt political system,\u201d he said, accusing drug companies, insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry for \u201cdetermining what is happening in Washington.\u201d --Maureen Groppe When it came to gun violence, Kamala Harris talked about how difficult it is to see school children drill for mass shooters. \u201cIt is traumatizing our children,\u201d she said. Then she brought up the president\u2019s words as a contributing factor, bringing up the Walmart shooting in El Paso last month that left 22 dead and dozens more wounded. Before the shooting, the gunman penned a racist, anti-immigrant manifesto that the president\u2019s critics have said echo the president\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cPeople asked me in El Paso, \u2018Well do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?\u2019, she said. \u201cI said \u2018Well, look, he obviously didn\u2019t pull the trigger, but he\u2019s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition\u2019.\u201d -- Ledyard King After several of his competitors praised O\u2019Rourke for his advocacy of gun control after a mass shooting in his home town, one of the moderators pressed him about his proposal to buy back military-style assault weapons. Critics call that confiscation. O\u2019Rourke said the weapons have to go when they\u2019re being used against children. He described meeting a mother who watched her daughter bleed to death in Odessa after being shot with an AR-15. \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. --Maureen Groppe One key theme to emerge from the third Democratic presidential debate, so far: The gloves are off. The ten candidates on stage have engaged in some of the sharpest exchanges Americans have witnessed so far in the race to replace President Donald Trump. Much of that tension in the first hour has been wrapped around the fight over how the nation should proceed on health care. Candidates had zingers ready, but their fire was not directed in all directions \u2013 and not necessarily just at front runner Joe Biden. Many observers were watching for fireworks between Biden and Elizabeth Warren, who has been steadily gaining grounds in polling. But, so far, most of the debate has played out between the three front runners \u2013 Biden, Warren and Bernie Sanders \u2013 and the rest of the field. It was Julian Castro who claimed Biden was \u201cforgetting what you said two minutes ago,\u201d a not-so-subtle knock on Biden\u2019s propensity for gaffes. It was Amy Klobuchar who was among the most forceful critics of Sanders\u2019 plan to expand government health care. -- John Fritze First Kamala Harris thanked Barack Obama for passing the Affordable Care Act that expanded health care for millions. Then the California senator thanked Bernie Sanders for proposing Medicare for All. Finally, she brought up the ghost of Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who died last year, when talking about how he stopped Donald Trump\u2019s plan to kill Obamacare. \u201cDonald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his office trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all fought against that, and then the late, great John McCain at about 2 in the morning killed his attempt to kill health care for millions of people in this country.\u201d As she spoke she pointed her right thumb down, mimicking McCain\u2019s famous gesture when he broke from his party and became the deciding vote in 2017 against Trump\u2019s plan to repeal Obamacare. -- Ledyard King More than 30 minutes into the debate, Cory Booker had not had a chance to speak since his opening statement. During a spirited debate over health care, Booker was mainly silent while other candidates had a chance to jump in multiple times. Booker got the last word on the debate over health care. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency right now in this nation, everybody feels it,\u201d Booker said when the camera turned to him. \u201cWe cannot sacrifice progress on the altar of purity.\u201d -- John Fritze Amy Klobuchar came out swinging against the progressive plan to prove government health insurance for all Americans \u2013 and what has become a Bernie Sanders campaign mantra. \u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill,\u201d Klobuchar fired at Sanders, arguing that the plan would drop millions of Americans off their private health insurance. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bold idea, I think it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d The line was a response to Sanders' oft-repeated line that he \"wrote the damn bill\" to move to a Medicare-for-All health insurance system. Health care, and the fight over whether to make adjustments to Obamacare or to scrap it for additional government coverage, has dominated the opening moments of virtually every Democratic debate this year \u2013 and it has widely split the field. -- John Fritze Bernie Sanders, in an extended defense of his Medicare for All plan, argued the proposal would be cost-effective. Then he added, \u201cI wrote the damn bill!\u201d It was a recycled line that he first used in a presidential debate in July, when he claimed the plan would provide union members with better health care coverage than they have now. Tim Ryan interjected, \"You don't know that, Bernie. \"I do know that \u2014 I wrote the damn bill,\" Sanders fired back. --Michael Collins Moderator George Stephanopoulos immediately tried to get the top three candidates engaged in a debate over how far left the party should go. He asked Biden whether Sanders and Warren are pushing too far beyond where most Democrats are on health care, climate change and college costs. \u201cThat\u2019s for voters to decide,\u201d Biden said. \u201cLet me tell you what I think.\u201d After saying Obamacare worked, Biden went after the cost of Medicare for All, saying Sanders and Warren haven\u2019t explained how it will be paid for. Warren responded that the question is how to improve on Obamacare. \u201cAnd I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure everybody gets covered with health care at the lowest possible cost,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd middle-class families are going to pay less.\u201d -- Maureen Groppe Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has made gun control a centerpiece of his campaign, went hard on the issue in his opening statement. O\u2019Rourke used his first words to note the El Paso shooting on Aug. 3 that left 22 people dead. The former Texas congressman also went after President\u00a0Donald Trump, arguing that the shooter was \u201cinspired to kill by our president.\u201d -- John Fritze It didn\u2019t take long for someone to use the most famous line associated with the city hosting the debate. \u201cHouston we have a problem,\u201d said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. a reference to the message from Apollo 13 astronauts to Mission Control in Houston. The NASA mission in 1970 returned to Earth after technical problems prevented it from reaching the moon. -- Ledyard King The third Democratic presidential debate is underway in Houston. Appearing on stage from left to right; Amy Klobuchar; Pete Buttigieg; Bernie Sanders; Joe Biden; Elizabeth Warren; Kamala Harris; Andrew Yang, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Julian Castro. Buckle up: The debate, which is airing on ABC and Univision, is expected to last three hours. Follow along here for the latest. -- John Fritze In July, it was the season finale of The Bachelorette. This time, football fans who are following the Democratic presidential race will face a choice: NFL Thursday Night Football will feature a match-up between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers. Politics observers \u2013 including President Donald Trump \u2013 have often paid close attention to the ratings captured by networks hosting the debates. Are Americans still tuning in? Is interest in the race already waning, less than five months from the Iowa caucuses? Are Americans, as the president claimed after ratings were released for one of two debates in July, just \u201cdesperate for Trump\u201d? In July, both the debate and\u00a0the Bachelorette finale\u00a0were slated to run from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. ET, forcing millions of Americans to choose between national politics and reality-TV politics. Some 8.7 million viewers watched the first night\u2019s debate live on CNN. Another 2.8 million watched on CNN\u2019s live stream. That bested The Bachelorette, which drew 7.4 million viewers. This time, the debate is almost certain to have a major advantage in the ratings battle. The candidates will scrimmage on the ABC broadcast network; the game is on the cable-only NFL Network. The game is also being played in Charlotte, N.C., the site of next year's Republican nominating convention. -- David Jackson and John Fritze Andrew Yang promised this week to do something unusual at tonight\u2019s debate. It turns out, he will deliver on that promise. Buzzfeed News reported Thursday that Yang is planning to announce a contest in which he will award 10 families with $1,000 a month for one year. Yang has pulled out the marketing move before (though not at a debate). The effort is intended to highlight his plan for a universal basic income \u2013 a central part of his economic message \u2013 in which every American citizen over the age of 18 would be guaranteed $1,000 a month. The idea has gained prominence among some economists who argue a universal income would offset job loss caused by advances in technology. -- John Fritze The candidates have been warned. Or maybe begged. ABC, which is hosting tonight\u2019s Democratic debate, would really appreciate it if the Democrats can keep from swearing during the three-hour event. It\u2019s not that the network doesn\u2019t appreciate passion and authenticity. But the network is governed by Federal Communication Commission indecency rules. And because there will be no delay on broadcasting the live event, ABC will not be able to edit out foul language, the network told the candidates. They may be particularly concerned about former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has been dropping the F-bomb to express his anger about gun violence. His campaign is even selling T-shirts with the expression he\u2019s used. Asked Saturday if he would swear on the debate stage, O\u2019Rourke had a five-letter response: Maybe. During the first debates in June, entrepreneur Andrew Yang said the Russians are laughing their (behinds) off at the United States as they try to manipulate the elections. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker used the S-word during the last debates. But he was repeating President Donald Trump\u2019s reported description of countries from which he did not want to accept immigrants. Booker has also sworn on social media, such as when he tweeted in June a defense of fellow competitor Kamala Harris\u2019 heritage, saying she doesn\u2019t have \u201csh\u2014t\u201d to prove. When a follower questioned whether someone else had taken over Booker\u2019s account, he responded: \u201cOh, this is definitely me.\u201d -Maureen Groppe Former Vice President Joe Biden will need to prove himself against Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren who has been rising in the polls. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is still competing with Warren for support from the most progressive wing of the party. And California Sen. Kamala Harris will try to reignite the spark she lit from the first debate that has since faded. How to watch: Warren, Biden face off in tonight's debate. Here's how to watch What to watch:\u00a0Five questions the Democratic debate may answer Relive the highlights: Top moments from the last debate The six other candidates on stage still have to show that they belong in the top tier. Democrats who didn\u2019t meet the party\u2019s qualifying rules for tonight\u2019s debate \u2013 including Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and\u00a0Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan \u2013 will have a harder time qualifying for next month\u2019s debate without tonight\u2019s exposure.\u00a0Billionaire Tom Steyer didn't make this debate but has met the conditions for the next one, in October. After opening statements, tonight\u2019s contenders will have one minute and 15 seconds for direct responses to questions. They\u2019ll get an additional 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals. Airing on ABC and Univision, the three-hour event will be moderated by ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, David Muir, Linsey Davis and by Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos. The candidates are debating at Texas Southern University, a historically black university in Houston. Texas is also home to two of the competitors, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro who will be standing next to each other on one end of the stage. The order was determined by polling averages. Here\u2019s the full list from left to right: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sanders; Biden; Warren; Harris; entrepreneur Andrew Yang, O\u2019Rourke; Castro. \u2013 Maureen Groppe President Donald Trump will miss the Democratic debate on Thursday because he\u2019s speaking to Republican lawmakers holding their annual retreat in Baltimore. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the president doesn\u2019t have thoughts. Trump predicted that Joe Biden will prevail so long as \u201che doesn\u2019t make any major mistakes.\u201d Like many Americans, the president also seems eager to view the Democratic field as being much smaller than it is on paper. \u201cYou have three people leading,\u201d Trump told reporters on the South Lawn. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be one of those three.\u201d --\u00a0David Jackson and John\u00a0 Fritze If tonight\u2019s candidates took the stage based on how often they\u2019ve been Googled this past week instead of by their polling averages, the center stage would look a little different. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders would still be there. But Andrew Yang, not Elizabeth Warren, would be in the top three, according to Google. Warren ranked fourth. The search engine also looked at the top questions people had about the candidates this week. Googlers wanted to know if Beto O\u2019Rourke, Julian Castro and Amy Klobuchar are still running. Searchers were curious about whether Cory Booker is dating or married. The top question people had about the three oldest candidates \u2013 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 was how old they are. And one of the top five questions for nearly every candidate was how tall they are. But despite a common belief that the tallest candidate usually wins, the shorter person won three of the last five presidential elections. --Maureen Groppe What are the candidates who didn\u2019t qualify for tonight\u2019s debate doing instead? Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan is speaking at the University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of law, his alma mater. Billionaire Tom Steyer and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock campaigned in Iowa Thursday. \u201cSee you in Iowa today, and over the next 143 days!\u201d Bullock tweeted. After her watch party at the Writers Guild of America in California, author Marianne Williamson planned to talk about what she would have said had she been on stage. Her take, moderated by a writer with The Hollywood Reporter, will be livestreamed. Supporters of Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are gathering at Veggie Street Restaurant where they will \u201cblast searches and inundate social media with our support for Tulsi.\u201d --Maureen Groppe President Donald Trump will, of course, be center stage at the Democratic presidential debate on Thursday without having ever stepped into Houston. But the Trump campaign apparently also wanted to own the skies. Trump\u2019s campaign hired a plane to fly a banner over the debate\u2019s host city. The message drew from the president\u2019s leading reelection mantra: That Democrats running to replace him 2020 have veered too far to the left. \u201cSocialism will kill Houston's economy,\u201d the banner read. \u201cVote Trump 2020.\u201d -- John Fritze",

      "content": "CLARKSDALE, Miss. \u2014 It was a rainy February morning, but Clarksdale Collegiate Principal Amanda Johnson was fired up. \u201cYou know how Ms. Johnson feels about Friday,\u201d she told the students as she paced around the cafeteria in an \u201cI am black history\u201d shirt. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t get it all done \u2026 Friday\u2019s the day you turn it around.\u201d The former church youth-group multipurpose room had become a shrine to academic achievement, the stained-glass window overshadowed by bold purple banners listing the students\u2019 future college graduation years, the school\u2019s values and the slogan \u201c#RUReady.\u201d The students were just in kindergarten, first and second grade, but Johnson was projecting far into the future. \u201cRaise your hand if you know your stretch goal,\u201d Johnson said \u2014 referring to students\u2019 personal better-than-best target score on their upcoming standardized tests. \u201cI need you to know what you\u2019re aiming at.\u201d Ricky Taylor, a skinny first grader with a gap between his front teeth, raised his hand up until it practically lifted him off the bench. \u201cMy stretch goal in math is 191,\u201d he said. Johnson hustled over and gave Ricky a dollar. Johnson opened the doors of Mississippi\u2019s first rural charter school in this temporary space a year ago. Pulling students from Coahoma County and its county seat of Clarksdale, the school was a bid to cultivate the greatness she saw in these local kids, including her own daughters. They were so bright, so eager, and yet if the current statistics held, 25% would not graduate from high school. But Clarksdale Collegiate opened in the face of protest. The Clarksdale school board and Advocates for Public Education, a group of local parents and educators formed to oppose the charter, submitted an amicus brief in support of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u00a0lawsuit aiming\u00a0to overturn the state\u2019s entire charter law. In a county with fewer than 27,000 residents, more than 1,300 people signed a petition opposing the school. They wanted a better education for all students, not just a few, Coahoma County lawmaker Johnny Newson told the Mississippi Charter School Authorizer Board. Nationally, controversy over opening a charter school is nothing new. But in Clarksdale, it had a particularly painful resonance. In 1970, when the courts ordered schools to desegregate and controversies over busing erupted across the country, white parents in Coahoma County fled the public system for private segregation academies, calling it \u201cschool choice.\u201d White abandonment of the public system impoverished the public schools that served Clarksdale\u2019s African American majority. Fifty years later, the term \u201cschool choice\u201d still evokes injustice to the elderly African American educators and NAACP civil rights activists who led the drive to stop Clarksdale Collegiate. They saw the charter school as a new way to create a free but essentially private education for the privileged. Public schools still fight segregation, too: 63 years after landmark Brown v. Board case, segregated classrooms persist Despite the opposition, parents came to Clarksdale Collegiate. Ricky\u2019s foster parents, Sakenna and Keithan Dear, worked in public school systems, but they signed Ricky up anyway. They hoped this school would support the child they were trying to adopt, who had come to them at age 3 from the children\u2019s hospital in Memphis barely speaking, and left kindergarten at a local public school unable to read basic sight words. Ricky had his own hopes for his new school. He wanted his teachers to pay attention to him. He wanted them to build a playground. He wanted to learn how to fly an airplane, only not too far off the ground, because heights were scary. Like Ricky's foster family, most families who came to the charter were black, and they believed Johnson when she said her school would be different. It would, first and last, be better than the schools the area already had. Johnson was opening outside the traditional public system not to create some kind of segregated fiefdom but because that\u2019s where she knew how to run a great school. But she faced an uphill battle against public sentiment strong enough to silence even supporters. She would have to convince them by following through on her promises, helping kids like Ricky learn to read. In 1969, Clarksdale schools were still separate and unequal, 14 years after the Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision. But that October, the court decided Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, ruling against the \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d plans school districts had maintained in Mississippi and elsewhere. In response, the Clarksdale Press-Register outlined how white parents could leave the districts. About 500 white parents attended the first meeting to discuss opening a private, segregated school; 115 registered on the spot for the future school, which would later be named Lee Academy. When the Clarksdale Public schools reopened Feb. 2, 1970, after a one-day integration reorganization break, 574 of Clarksdale Junior High\u2019s 585 white students did not show up, the newspaper reported. White children vanished entirely from the public schools in nearby counties \u2014 Indianola lost almost 1,000 to private schools. Mississippi\u2019s public school enrollment fell by 23,000 students that month, the Associated Press reported. \u201cWe never really integrated,\u201d former high school teacher Josephine Rhymes said. Where it all began: How an accidental encounter brought slavery to the United States The racial divide between the private and public sector is still stark, and the decades of disinvestment took their toll. It\u2019s no secret now that the condition of the public schools is a roadblock to Clarksdale\u2019s revitalization, residents said. While the city has capitalized on its history as \u201cthe birthplace of the blues\u201d with festivals and artsy shops, many downtown sidewalks are littered with shattered glass and poverty remains at 36%. Superintendent Dennis Dupree came to the city 12 years ago, promising innovation. He brought in more than $15 million in federal and state funding. He introduced literacy and social-emotional learning programs backed by major funders such as The Walton Family Foundation. Dupree\u2019s initiatives were buttressed by community youth programs focused on creativity, employability and college readiness. But the grants ran out, and any lingering positive effects were not visible in test scores. Both the Clarksdale and Coahoma systems were rated F on the state\u2019s 2018 school report cards and are eligible for state takeover. Dupree, who retired from Clarksdale schools at the end of the 2018-19 school year, declined several requests for an interview. Amanda Johnson, a Little Rock native, came to the Arkansas side of the Delta in 2003 with Teach For America. She felt comfortable in the Delta in a way most of her TFA peers did not. Her father knew people in her district; she was close enough to her college in Memphis, Tennessee, to drive back for church. Because she is African American, like most of the residents, \u201cno one knew I was Teach For America,\u201d she said. She liked the people and the culture and the history. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of greatness that\u2019s here that I want to be a part of and help grow and support,\u201d she said. After TFA, she joined the KIPP charter network at KIPP Delta in Helena, Arkansas; when the network opened an elementary school, she became its leader. Johnson fell in love with the organization\u2019s college-prep focus and refusal to let poverty dictate outcomes. As Johnson settled in Clarksdale in 2010, the reasons for her to do that work in her adopted hometown multiplied. She had two daughters to educate, and she believed high school failure rates showed\u00a0the lower schools weren\u2019t getting the job done. She knew she could find a way for her daughters in the local district if she had to. But she wanted something better and different for them, and for her neighbors. When Mississippi\u2019s Legislature voted in 2016 to let students cross district lines to attend charter schools, Johnson was ready. Johnson began working her connections, and her experience and low-key magnetism worked wonders. First, she got a fellowship with Building Excellent Schools, a charter leadership incubator. Using the program\u2019s resources, Johnson planned Clarksdale Collegiate down to the smallest detail as she tackled the Mississippi charter school application process. Clarksdale Collegiate would be \u201cunapologetically college preparatory,\u201d she wrote in her application. She incorporated elements that were familiar in charter-heavy places like Detroit and Memphis but new in Clarksdale, such as decking the hallways with college pennants, illustrations of the school\u2019s core values and graphs of scholars\u2019 academic progress, including the number of words each grade had read as tracked by Accelerated Reader, one of the school\u2019s educational software programs. Johnson planned an extended, highly structured day, more than eight hours, with 75-minute blocks of math \u2014 even for kindergarteners \u2014 and literacy rotations for two hours at a stretch, including daily library class. The year ran almost three weeks longer than that of the district. Clarksdale Collegiate would be lightning-focused on metrics and testing even though the official state tests on which its renewal would hang didn\u2019t start until the third grade. Everything would be done with urgency \u2014 a trait she observed at the charter schools she thought were most successful, places like Nashville Classical. There was no time to waste. \u201cKids don\u2019t do well K through fourth and then start failing in fifth grade,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now matters.\u201d Halfway through the school\u2019s first year, parents had embraced the intensity. At report card night in February, a kindergartener danced with a stuffed unicorn as her mother frowned at her data binder. \u201cI think this is great,\u201d kindergarten teacher Latasha Capers said. \u201cIt\u2019s great, but it can be exceptional,\u201d the mom said. Johnson\u2019s vision for the school has it serving about 675 children. That size would let Clarksdale Collegiate \u201cimpact change outside of our own school,\u201d she said. Over the next decade, it also would amount to as much as a quarter of Coahoma and Clarksdale\u2019s current public school enrollment, and siphon off a lot of money that might otherwise go to the regular public systems. The charter school pulled roughly $149,000 in local taxes from the Clarksdale district in its first year alone, Cocke said, \u201cand each year it will go up.\u201d During Clarksdale Collegiate\u2019s first year, an additional 29 students who chose to attend the school would have attended Coahoma County public schools, according to school data. The charter may not be siphoning out white students as the old segregation academies did, but to many critics of the school, pulling resources from the traditional public schools is just as unforgivable. Donell Harrell became the Clarksdale district\u2019s first black superintendent in the 1990s. Sitting at McDonald\u2019s where he meets with other retired men in the mornings, Harrell said he might have supported the charter school had the district been adequately funded. The Mississippi Legislature has fully funded the state\u2019s public education system only twice in more than 20 years. \u201cI think at some point choice would be appropriate, but don\u2019t shortchange public schools,\u201d he said. In theory, as a public school, Clarksdale Collegiate\u2019s finances should have been about the same as the local districts. In 2017-18, Coahoma spent $9,279 and Clarksdale $8,424 in state and local per-pupil funds. The charter school received $1.2 million in per-pupil funds for its 145 students for 2017-18, or about $8,200 per child, the school\u2019s financial manager Stacie Landry said. However, Johnson increased the amount she could spend on her students by raising a lot of private money. Clarksdale Collegiate recorded almost $820,000 in philanthropy for the past school year, Landry said. In total, Clarksdale Collegiate had revenues of $2.5 million for 145 students in its first year, Landry said \u2014 roughly $17,000 per student. Johnson said that much of that money went to one-time startup costs, such as stocking the library. The largest slice went to personnel: She paid teachers about 5% more than the Coahoma County system average, and paid her instructional aides almost double the state minimum of $12,500. Her own salary was $90,000 during the school\u2019s first year, she said. Critics like Harrell and Rhymes said the money would be better spent supporting schools in the district. Even A-rated Kirkpatrick Elementary, next door to Clarksdale Collegiate, is hurting for funds. Kirkpatrick kindergarten teacher Teresa Scheider implemented some of the same rules followed at Clarksdale Collegiate: Be nice, do your very best. She had the same high expectations: The state required that students write their numbers up to 30, she said, but her students furrowed their brows writing their numbers up to 100. \u201cShe\u2019s the best teacher,\u201d kindergartener Raniya Berry said. \u201cWe be doing rhyming words and we be doing compound words and we write stories.\u201d Still, Scheider seemed ground-down. Standardized examinations were something to be endured, not celebrated like across the street. \u201cEducation is not what I want it to be anymore,\u201d she said \u2014 too much testing, not enough focus on kids\u2019 social development, to their detriment. She no longer visits students\u2019 homes: \u201cI\u2019m afraid to now,\u201d she said. Clarksdale Collegiate special education teacher Sakenna Dear \u2014 Ricky's foster mom \u2014 knows the frustrations. She and her husband Keithan are Coahoma-born and -bred, and they want to stay in the area. \u201cIf you were born here, you want to succeed,\u201d she said. She became a teacher and did the best she could working at a traditional public school, even though the leadership rarely provided meaningful professional development or transparency, she said. Then Ricky started kindergarten, and she saw how deep the problems went. He had a substitute teacher all year, who sent home bad reports about Ricky\u2019s academic progress. Yet at dinner, Ricky described days of coloring and watching movies. Keithan Dear,\u00a0the Coahoma system\u2019s web developer and computer technician, worried a bit about \u201cthe conflict of interest\u201d when they applied for Clarksdale Collegiate. But \u201cbeing a parent now, it\u2019s whatever\u2019s best for the kid,\u201d he said. \u201cAround here we need to try something different.\u201d When Sakenna Dear brought Ricky in to register, Johnson invited her to interview for a job. She did, and took it. She wanted something different for herself, too. One way that Clarksdale Collegiate is different from the choice schools of the past is in the composition of its student body. In its first year, Clarksdale Collegiate\u2019s student body was 93% black, according to data the school provided. The State of Mississippi reported that 63% of the charter\u2019s students were eligible for free lunch, compared to 74% of students in the Clarksdale public school district and 77% of Coahoma students. Coahoma High graduate Adrienne Hudson, who runs the education-improvement group RISE MS, was initially skeptical of charters. She feared cherry-picking and thought of charter administrators as \u201cthis outside force basically coming in trying to rescue this community from itself,\u201d she said. \u201cMy answer would always be no, no, no, probably an expletive no.\u201d Mississippi lawmakers tried to build in preventive measures to keep the new schools of choice from exacerbating Mississippi\u2019s stark educational disparities. Lisa Karmacharya, the Mississippi Charter School Authorizer Board\u2019s executive director, said the purpose of the charter law was to help \u201cthe underserved population.\u201d The law requires charters\u2019 enrollment of special education, low-income and English-language learning students to be within 80% of that in the district in which the schools operate. However, even the best law is nothing without enforcement. Penn State University education researcher Erica Frankenberg cautioned that it\u2019s rare for states to make sure charters are following laws requiring them to enroll a representative proportion of students. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a charter revoked for these reasons,\u201d she said. The rubric by which Mississippi charters are evaluated puts significant weight on requirements that charters serve special education students and conduct non-discriminatory admissions, but the more general stipulation that a charter serve a representative percentage of \u201cunderserved\u201d students \u201d counts for only 3 of 100 points. And even then, the state may renew a school even if it has organizational problems. Karmacharya said discussions were underway to revise the evaluation form to better reflect the law. The state board has not yet made any renewal decisions. Karmacharya is adamant that she and her board are committed to ensuring that the state\u2019s charter schools serve a student population that is similar to that of the district\u2019s non-charter public schools. Johnson felt just as strongly about reflecting the community. In contrast to the state teaching workforce as a whole, Johnson\u2019s staff, like the students, is mostly African American. Critics like Hudson came to believe in Johnson\u2019s commitment to creating a school that reflected and empowered the community. \u201cShe is working very hard to be a public charter school,\u201d Hudson said. As the school\u2019s first year drew to a close, everyone at Clarksdale Collegiate felt good. Ricky walked with his fellow Vanderbilt University homeroom students past his achievements, which papered the walls around him. He smoked through the ST Math computer program and beamed from a Scholar of the Week photo. He had earned a popcorn party, a trampoline trip and a special recess. Clarksdale Collegiate had lived up to his hopes. The night before, he vroomed around the Dears\u2019 circular driveway on the bike he\u2019d learned to ride without training wheels in three days. He paused briefly to gush about first grade. \u201cMy favorite thing to do in school is to play on the playground. We finally have one! Finally finally finally,\u201d he said. He also loved science class, though \u201cit\u2019s not like real ones. I want to make potions and stuff.\u00a0That\u2019s what a real scientist does.\u201d But that was OK. \u201cI love school so much I just want to hug the school,\u201d Ricky said. He zoomed off again. Sakenna Dear felt much the same way, both for the changes in Ricky and for herself. Johnson \u201creally sets the tone and makes school fun,\u201d she said. \u201cIt pushes me as a teacher and administrator to want to do more.\u201d Johnson rejoiced in May over the kindergarten scores: 78th percentile in reading and 81st in math on the nationally used Measures of Academic Progress test. Her vision was on track. Only one staffer was leaving, while 68 people had applied for the 15 jobs that would be available when the school reopened in July after a short summer break. Clarksdale Collegiate had a wait list at every grade, with 88 applications for kindergarten alone. \u201cI hate telling people they\u2019re on the wait list \u2014 which is a good problem to have,\u201d Johnson said. Maybe, she thought, it meant the community was coming around. Ricky Taylor, however, would not be coming back. His adoption was finalized in April, and he had a new name. \u201cRicky Dear!\u201d he said. \u201cDear, like the rest of my family.\u201d He had already begun to write it on his worksheets.

But first, a thing of nightmares:\u00a0A rare, two-headed rattlesnake was found slithering around New Jersey. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d At least 10 tornadoes were reported in South Carolina and North Carolina over the past day as\u00a0Hurricane Dorian approached, adding another layer of worrisome weather threatening nervous residents. Parts of historic Market Street in Charleston, North Carolina, were under a foot of water Thursday as\u00a0the hurricane continued its advance\u00a0on the U.S. coast. Hundreds of thousands of coastal residents of the Carolinas packed\u00a0up to flee their homes or were already gone. Almost 250,000 homes and businesses across the region were without power. As of midafternoon, the eye of Dorian was just offshore of Cape Romain, South Carolina. Michigan State University will\u00a0pay a record $4.5 million fine\u00a0for its poor handling of the Larry Nassar case,\u00a0the federal Education Department announced Thursday. \"What happened at MSU was abhorrent\u00a0...\u00a0so was the university's response to their crimes,\" U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said, referring to former MSU and USA Gymnastics doctor Nassar\u00a0and his boss, former osteopathic college Dean William Strampel. Over and over in a 54-page document, the Office of Civil Rights says\u00a0MSU knew about issues with Nassar and Strampel and brushed them aside. The outcome of that burying of problems was to create an environment in which\u00a0female students knew they would not be believed, the report says. Once a week, we'll feature\u00a0some\u00a0\ud83d\udd25 story picks from my USA TODAY colleagues. This week: \"Golden Girls\" enthusiast Felicia. Nicki Minaj tweeted Thursday that she's \"decided to retire\" to focus on having a family, promptly setting the interwebs on fire. But is she really leaving music behind?\u00a0Though the\u00a036-year-old rap diva didn't expand\u00a0on her tweet publicly, her announcement left fans reeling on Twitter. \"PLS SAY SIKE,\" one person\u00a0tweeted. \"Delete this now,\" another\u00a0wrote.\u00a0Minaj's tweet comes about a month after she\u00a0announced her plans to marry Kenneth Petty. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u00a0had some dietary advice for Vice President Mike Pence:\u00a0\"We\u2019re not too keen on that chlorinated chicken,\"\u00a0Johnson told Pence during a meeting Thursday on the prospects of a U.S.-U.K. trade deal. Seems random, but let's back up: During trade deal talks, some British officials expressed concern that U.S. farmers engage in chlorine washing of chickens. The British prime minister used\u00a0the poultry term as a\u00a0political taunt against Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn this week. \"We have a gigantic chlorinated chicken of our own, here, on the opposition benches,\u201d he told Pence. Oh, and Johnson told Pence that Americans don't eat\u00a0enough British lamb and haggis. Young men have died in fraternities every year for two decades. They\u00a0died from alcohol poisoning, extreme physical labor or complications from injuries \u2013 all in the name of fraternal brotherhood. Yet Greek initiations roll on. In response, frats banned hard liquor \u2013 but mothers of the students who died say that\u2019s not enough. The deaths will keep coming, they say. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not perfect,\u201d one fraternity advocate acknowledged. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with college students.\u201d Recent deaths have increased pressure on fraternities to change and revived an old discussion: Are the benefits of fraternity membership worth the lives of young adults?

      "content": " LOUISVILLE, Ky. - High school journalists who were barred last week from a roundtable event with U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos\u00a0in Kentucky have made national news after calling out the event's lack of openness. \"We are student journalists who wanted to cover an event in our community featuring the Secretary of Education, but ironically, we couldn\u2019t get in without an invitation,\" the students said in an editorial in their newspaper at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, a public school in Lexington. The editorial caught the attention of local and national news outlets. The Washington Post wrote a piece about how the student's turned\u00a0their travails into the story. In the students' piece, \"No Seat at the Roundtable,\" the \u00a0newspaper's\u00a0two editor-in-chiefs\u00a0said they were waved away the morning of April 17 when an event bouncer learned they hadn't RSVP'd to the event. The roundtable, hosted by the Bluegrass Community & Technical College in Lexington, focused on a a possible federal tax credit scholarship. 'Yeah, how is that illegal?': Kid reporter confronts officer who threatened to arrest her near Arizona-Mexico border DeVos' department is proposing \"Education Freedom Scholarships,\" which would\u00a0offer up to $5 billion in annual federal tax breaks to those choosing to donate to state-based scholarship programs. Beyond their own problems attempting to enter the event, the students questioned the 11 a.m. Wednesday timing of the event, saying it's an inconvenient time for teachers and students to attend. The editorial questioned why only one student, who attends a private school in Louisville, had a seat at the table. \"... As students, we are the ones who are going to be affected by the\u00a0proposed changes discussed\u00a0at the roundtable, yet we were not allowed inside,\" the students, Olivia Doyle and Abigail Wheatley, wrote. And as the Courier Journal reported last week,\u00a0while many state education officials and school-choice supporters attended, no public school employees were included in the roundtable. Charter schools: Betsy DeVos calls for more charter schools even as they spark investigations across the country What we know: Betsy DeVos wants to cut Special Olympics funds and people are outraged \"The bottom line is that we do not think that it is fair to have a closed roundtable about education when it affects thousands of Kentucky teachers, students, and parents,\" the students wrote. A media advisory on the education department's website included press contacts and noted\u00a0reporters needed to have RSVP'd for the event by 8 a.m. on the day of the events. The students say they\u00a0learned of DeVos' visit the day before and started making plans to attend. But when they arrived at the public school campus for the event they knew was open to reporters, the students said, a\u00a0man wearing a college badge told them they needed an invitation to attend. The Lexington Herald-Leader\u00a0reported\u00a0that U.S. Department of Education Press Secretary Liz Hill said no one on DeVos' staff knew that student journalists were trying to get into the event. \"We welcome student journalists and would have been happy for them to be in attendance,\" she said. \"We are looking into what, if any, miscommunication might have happened between other staff on site for the event.\u201d Follow Matthew Glowicki on Twitter:\u00a0@MattGlo ",

      "content": " DETROIT \u2013 Michigan State University will pay a record $4.5 million fine for its poor handling of the Larry Nassar case, the federal education department announced Thursday. \"What happened at MSU was abhorrent. .... so was the university's response to their crimes,\" U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in announcing the findings, referring to Nassar and his boss, former osteopathic college Dean William Strampel. In immediate fallout from the report, MSU Provost June Youatt resigned from the university, sources told the Free Press. Youatt, the No. 2 person at the university responsible for the academic side of the institution, was specifically called out in the report for failing to take action in the Strampel case. Nassar: She surrendered her secrets to put away a sexual predator. But her sacrifice isn't over Start the day smarter: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox This is the second time in less than five years that the federal government has found major violations of Title IX at MSU.\u00a0In 2015,\u00a0before Nassar was publicly known, the Office of Civil Rights said MSU\u00a0did not act promptly to handle two reports of sexual assault. The office also found the university did not have proper procedures and policies in place to handle sexual assault reports, which created a sexually hostile environment on campus. In addition, the school must hire an outside law firm to review all sex assault case decisions made by the school's Title IX office and issue a report to the federal government. MSU's board and president must also receive a regular report of all cases and decisions. MSU also must conduct a sweeping investigation into who knew what and didn't act on both the Nassar case and his boss, Strampel, who was recently convicted of criminal charges. That includes former MSU President Lou Anna Simon, who is currently facing criminal charges of lying to police in the Nassar investigation; Provost Youatt, who knew for years of sexual harassment claims by Strampel and cleared him; along with the associate vice president for academic human resources, employees of the Office of the General Counsel, and the former head coach of the women's gymnastics team. \"Because it failed to promptly and equitably respond to reports and grievances alleging sexual harassment perpetrated by Employee X (Larry Nassar) and the Dean (William Strampel) and failed to take appropriate actions reasonably calculated to end the harassment, eliminate the hostile environment, and prevent the harassment from recurring,\" the Office of Civil Rights finding says. Identity revealed: Survivor in the Brock Turner rape case Over and over in the 54-page finding, the OCR found MSU knew about issues with Nassar and Strampel and brushed them aside. The outcome of that burying of problems was to create an environment where female students knew they would not be believed, the report says. For example, in the section in Strampel, the OCR writes:\u00a0\"The university's inaction in response to so many complaints ...\u00a0over so many years very likely perpetuated the belief expressed by many that they had no choice but to tolerate the dean's behavior because the university would not take any effective measures reasonably calculated to end it.\" Nassar was a doctor at MSU, along with the team doctor for USA Gymnastics.\u00a0He was sentenced\u00a0to 60 years in federal prison on child pornography charges.\u00a0He also faces a 40- to 175-year sentence issued in Ingham County and a 40- to 125-year sentence from Eaton County for sexual assaults.\u00a0Those sentences will not begin\u00a0until he finishes the federal sentence. Strampel was sentenced to a year in jail in June, after jurors found he used his power as dean of MSU's College of Osteopathic Medicine to proposition and control female medical students. The jury also determined there\u00a0was enough evidence to support prosecutors' argument that Strampel displayed \"complete indifference\" about whether Nassar was following protocols meant to decrease risk for the university following a complaint of sexual assault in 2014. Olympic skier: Blanca Fernandez Ochoa found dead in mountains MSU settled lawsuits by more than 300 Nassar survivors\u00a0with a payment of $500 million. However,\u00a0other lawsuits are\u00a0pending\u00a0from more than 100 Nassar survivors. Late last month, MSU said in legal filings it shouldn't be held legally responsible for Nassar. \"Although Nassar\u2019s actions were repugnant and merit the heavy criminal penalties imposed upon him, the law does not support Plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to hold the MSU Defendants liable for his wrongs,\" the university said in a court filing of more than 100 pages, backed by nearly 900 pages of exhibits.

      "author": "Michael Collins",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2013 What a difference a couple of years \u2013 and a couple of elections \u2013 can make. President Donald Trump, who famously hung up on Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull during a protocol-shattering phone call just a week after taking office, gave\u00a0the red-carpet treatment to Turnbull\u2019s successor, Scott Morrison, at the White House on Friday. Morrison and his wife, Jennifer, were feted with a formal state dinner \u2013 only the second of Trump\u2019s presidency. Dinner was served al fresco-style in the Rose Garden, which was lit by huge lights that bathed the area in a golden glow. The menu included ravioli drizzled with a lemony Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese emulsion and topped by shavings of carrots, baby kale and sunchoke chips. The main course was\u00a0roasted Dover sole accented with fennel mousseline. Dessert was\u00a0a Lady Apple tart with ice cream. Here are five things you should know about Morrison\u2019s visit: Morrison, 51, is Australia\u2019s 30th prime minister. He took office in 2018, succeeding Turnbull, and held onto power after his center-right government scored an astounding win in an election that pundits and pollsters had predicted it was certain to lose. Sound familiar? Morrison\u2019s upset victory has drawn comparisons to Trump\u2019s unexpected win against Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Before he became prime minister, Morrison served in the Australian parliament, where he once carried a chunk of coal onto the Parliament floor and proclaimed: \u201cThis is coal! Don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d Morrison was using the prop \u2013 against Parliament rules \u2013 to attack the Labor Party, which wanted to phase out coal power and press for more renewable energy. He also previously\u00a0served as Australia\u2019s immigration minister, where he helped develop a hardline policy to keep asylum-seekers from entering the country through its seaports. At the White House,\u00a0Morrison and his wife\u00a0arrived on the South Lawn Friday morning to a 19-gun salute\u00a0and were greeted by Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. After the traditional inspection of the troops, the two leaders spoke of what Trump called \"the unbreakable bond\"\u00a0between the two countries. \u201cAustralians and Americans understand each other like few other people,\u201d Morrison said. Friday night, the Morrisons were back at the White House for the state dinner. They\u00a0were met on the red carpet at the North Portico by the Trumps and were flanked by soldiers holding the Australian and American flags.\u00a0Melania Trump was dressed in a J. Mendel aqua silk chiffon gown, with inserted pleats and bias cut waves. Hardly. Though Morrison\u2019s political views are in line with Trump\u2019s on issues like immigration and energy, they are very different people, said Michael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute, an independent think tank based in Sydney. Morrison is a lifelong politician, a devout Christian (he\u2019s Australia\u2019s first Pentecostal prime minister) and an \u201ceveryman figure,\u201d Fullilove said. \u201cAustralian political values \u2013 including a belief in alliances and free trade \u2013 deviate from (President Trump\u2019s) brand,\u201d Fullilove said. \u201cBut they are both conservative figures. Prime Minister Morrison made his name as a tough immigration minister, which would appeal to the president.\u201d While they aren\u2019t from the same mold, the American press tends to cast them that way, \u201cwhich probably flattered and pleased the president,\u201d Fullilove said. \u201cSo President Trump was primed to like Prime Minister Morrison, and the (prime minister) has used that to his advantage,\u201d he said. More: Trump greets Australian prime minister in attempt to revive 'mateship' with U.S. ally Morrison said in a statement released by his office that he will be visiting the U.S. from Sept. 19-27. Besides Washington, he also will travel to Chicago, Ohio and New York. \u201cThere is no deeper friendship than that which exists between Australia and the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see the world through the same eyes, with shared values and a deep commitment to promoting peace, liberty and prosperity.\u201d Morrison described his visit as \u201ca valuable opportunity to further strengthen our security and economic partnership.\u201d At the White House, he held a bilateral meeting with Trump. The\u00a0meeting was followed by a news\u00a0conference with\u00a0the two leaders and, Friday night, the formal state dinner. On Sunday, Trump and Morrison will tour a new Pratt Industries paper-recycling mill in Wapakoneta, Ohio. The plant is owned by Australian billionaire Anthony Pratt, who has been a prominent Trump supporter. More: Think America can ditch Trump in 2020? The world says otherwise At a news conference following their meeting, Trump said they chatted about the military, trade and \"everything you can\u00a0talk about.\" China is Australia\u2019s leading trade partner and the U.S. is one of its closest allies, so the Aussies are uncomfortably caught in the middle of Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing. The trade war \u201chasn\u2019t had a big impact yet in Australia, except maybe to dampen some business confidence,\u201d said Alan Tidwell, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Australian, New Zealand and Pacific Studies. \u201cThe Australian economy was beginning to show a little fatigue even before the trade war got under way.\u201d Australia has agreed to join U.S.-led operations patrolling the Strait of Hormuz following Iran\u2019s seizure of tankers passing through the critical waterway earlier this summer, so that likely was part of the\u00a0discussion, along with last weekend\u2019s crippling drone and missile strikes on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities, Tidwell said.

Bush hosted one for then-Prime Minister John Howard in 2006 \u2014 included a number of prominent Australians and Americans. Golfer Greg Norman attended, as did\u00a0Lachlan Murdoch, executive chairman and chief executive officer of the Fox Corp. Other guests included Australian\u00a0astronaut Andy Thomas, who chatted with reporters about moon travel; Joseph Hockey, Australia's ambassador of Australia to the United States; and\u00a0Arthur Culvahouse, the U.S. ambassador\u00a0to Australia. Several members of the Trump administration and Congress were on the guest list,\u00a0including Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen, presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Trump lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri. In the Rose Garden, the guests sat at tables covered with a\u00a0pale yellow tablecloth and\u00a0white floral arrangements. A large carpet covered the grass on the lawn. Trump delivered a toast in honor of\u00a0\"a century of loyal and devoted friendship\" between the two countries. \"May our values always unite us,\" he said. In his toast, Morrison raised a glass and celebrated \"100 years of mateship and 100 more.\"",

The memo directs the government to develop an \"expedited\"\u00a0process, which the Department of Education said would mean loans are forgiven unless veterans opt out. Trump addressed a large crowd of veterans at the event, saying, \"You fought courageously for your country, and now we\u2019re fighting courageously for you.\" He also vowed to eliminate \"every penny\"\u00a0of an average of $30,000 in\u00a0federal student loan debt for each of\u00a0about 25,000 disabled veterans. At the conclusion of his address, the president stayed on stage to sign the executive order in front of the\u00a0crowd, flanked by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, among others. \u201cThat's hundreds of millions of dollars in student debt held by our severely wounded warriors.

      "content": " BALTIMORE\u00a0\u2014 While the media may focus on U.S.\u00a0Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, she told the nation's education reporters Monday that the focus should be on students and families. \"As much as many in the media use my name as clickbait or try to make it all about me, it\u2019s not,\" she said. \"Education is not about Betsy DeVos nor any other individual.\" Defining herself as a conservative with a distrust of government, DeVos used her appearance at the Education Writer's Association annual conference to promote her Education Freedom Scholarships and to continue her call for a redefinition of public schooling. \"It should surprise no one that I am a common-sense conservative with a healthy distrust of centralized government,\" she said. \"Instead, I trust the American people to live their own lives and to decide their own destinies. That\u2019s a freedom philosophy.\" For DeVos, a wealthy former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman whose Cabinet term has been marked with controversy, that means giving students and families the choice to move between schools. She says this will force traditional public schools to innovate and get better. Betsy DeVos roundtable: High school journalists were blocked from Betsy DeVos event. So, they wrote about it What we know: Betsy DeVos wants to cut Special Olympics funds and people are outraged It's a familiar mantra for DeVos, who pushed the establishment of charter schools in Michigan and helped to push an unsuccessful school vouchers ballot question in Michigan. She has proposed an Education Freedom Scholarship, which would use private scholarships to allow students who couldn't normally afford it to go to private schools. It ties in with DeVos' broader philosophy. \"Let\u2019s stop and rethink the definition of public education,\" she said. \"Today, it\u2019s often defined as one type of school, funded by taxpayers, controlled by government. But if every student is part of 'the public,'\u00a0then every way and every place a student learns is ultimately of benefit to 'the public.'\u00a0That should be the new definition of public education.\" DeVos furthered her push for school choice under questioning from New York Times reporter Erica Greene. \"More choices and more freedom in education will ultimately mean\u00a0better schools overall, even a neighborhood traditional public schools,\" DeVos said. \"Having the ability to direct where resources go on the child or family level helps families become wise consumers.\" During the question-and-answer period with the reporters, a Michigan-based reporter asked DeVos about Detroit schools and the charter schools in the city, which have a generally poor record, as does the Detroit traditional school system and why DeVos hadn't visited the city to talk to families about the schools. DeVos was instrumental in pushing Michigan's charter school law, including through political action groups and donations to Michigan legislators. DeVos said she had been to Detroit schools before she was Education secretary. She also said she doesn't think Michigan has true education \"freedom.\" She added that she hoped that would change.

DeVos said all public schools \u2014 charter and traditional \u2014 must follow laws, but said the bigger thing to focus on is why there are waiting lists in many places for charter schools and why more of those schools aren't available.

      "content": " CHICAGO\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The nation\u2019s third largest public school district violated Title IX by\u00a0failing\u00a0to respond promptly and equitably to complaints alleging sexual harassment, federal education officials announced Thursday,\u00a0concluding a years-long investigation. The federal probe revealed that the district's \"patchwork\" and disorganized investigations into sexual misconduct were poorly managed and were often conducted by staff who were not properly trained. The probe pertained to 2,800 student-on-student sexual harassment complaints\u00a0and 280 adult-on-student complaints\u00a0at over 400 district schools across four school years. Chicago Public Schools on Wednesday voluntarily entered into an agreement with the\u00a0U.S. Department of Education to take steps to begin to address concerns identified by the probe, the department's Office of Civil Rights said in a release\u00a0Thursday. \"For years, the district\u2019s management, handling\u00a0and oversight of complaints of student-on-student and adult-on-student sexual harassment have been in a state of disarray, to the great detriment of the students the District is responsible for educating,\" the release said. Consider this: The murder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee horrified Chicago. Now, gang members will stand trial CPS failed to respond promptly and equitably to complaints;\u00a0did not provide services and remedies to the complainants;\u00a0did not notify the complainants of investigation outcomes;\u00a0and did not take effective action to provide a safe environment for all students, according to a DOE press release. The probe noted that the district did not have a Title IX coordinator from 1999 to December 2018\u00a0and that the coordinators who followed did not have\u00a0full authority to carry out their responsibilities, among other concerns. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities that receive federal funds, obliging schools districts like CPS\u00a0to respond promptly and equitably to allegations of sex-based harassment. \"The Chicago Public Schools have inexcusably failed, for quite some time, to provide their students with the basic protections required by law. I am glad that CPS has now agreed to make a number of serious, substantive changes to come into compliance with Title IX,\"\u00a0said Kenneth L. Marcus,\u00a0assistant secretary for civil rights, in the Department of Education news release. Click here to read more about the investigation. The investigation began\u00a0in 2015 but grew in 2018 after the Chicago Tribune documented more than 500 police reports of sexual assault or abuse of a child inside a Chicago public school during the prior decade. District CEO Dr. Janice K. Jackson addressed the findings in a letter to the CPS community\u00a0Thursday. \"While we have made significant progress, we will not be satisfied until I and every CPS parent believes we have created a safe and supportive district culture,\" Jackson wrote. Jackson noted in the letter that CPS began\u00a0addressing many of the investigation's findings\u00a0in June\u00a02018, when the district\u00a0implemented\u00a0a Comprehensive Plan of Action to bolster protections of\u00a0students. The plan strengthened the district's\u00a0Title IX procedures. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos promised accountability\u00a0Thursday. \"The failures of Chicago Public Schools were widespread, glaring & heartbreaking. Too many innocent students suffered because adults didn\u2019t do their jobs. We will continue to ensure every student can learn in a safe environment & hold schools accountable,\" DeVos said in a Tweet. The Office of Civil Rights is\u00a0requiring CPS to: The Office of Civil Rights has given CPS\u00a0a Nov.\u00a027, 2019, deadline to submit documents demonstrating that the district has made required structural changes.

Alabama, Arizona, and Texas did not sign on. More: Buttigieg's huge student debt Three fast facts: Robert F. Smith gift to Morehouse highlights burden of student loan debt In April last year, DeVos announced a new partnership between the Departments of Education and Veterans Affairs that would match borrowers in the Department of Education's records system with disabled veterans in the Department of Veterans Affairs records system. People deemed eligible for loan discharges would be mailed a letter including an\u00a0application for \"totally and permanently disabled\" (TPD) status.\u00a0Under the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, if student borrowers die or become permanently disabled, they are eligible to have their loans forgiven, so a successful granting of TPD status would allow for the complete discharge of student loans. The attorneys general argued that automatically canceling the student debt would benefit veterans\u00a0whose\u00a0severe disabilities might prevent them from filling out the necessary forms. Like what you\u2019re reading?: Download the USA TODAY app for more Education Department spokesperson Liz Hill told Politico that \u201cwhile \u2018automatic discharge\u2019 may seem like a simple solution, there are long-term impacts we want all veterans to have the chance to consider before their loans are discharged.\u201d Hill also cited \"potential state and local tax liabilities\" that could burden veterans after their loans were forgiven and veterans' potential inability to take out other student loans in the future if their current ones were forgiven. Anticipating this criticism, the attorneys general wrote that \"we think it likely that most borrowers would prefer to have one hundred percent of their outstanding loans discharged, even if this resulted in an increase to their state tax bill,\" though they considered adding a way to opt out of the automatic loan forgiveness. According to a FOIA request filed by Veterans Education Succes, an advocacy group,\u00a0with the Department of Education, more than\u00a042,000 veterans\u00a0are eligible for TPD status, but fewer than\u00a09,000 people had applied as of the beginning of May 2018, More than\u00a025,000 eligible veterans were in default.",

In those cases, employees must\u00a0forward the messages to their work accounts within 20 days. In all, the Education Department's\u00a0Office of Inspector General\u00a0concluded\u00a0there was no\u00a0evidence of \u201cactive or extensive\u201d use of DeVos\u2019 personal email. Her office\u00a0told investigators it was taking \u201cadditional steps to identify and preserve\u201d emails in her personal accounts. Most of the fewer than 100 emails linked to DeVos' personal accounts\u00a0were from the first six months of 2017, soon after DeVos took office, the inquiry found. Most were also from a single unidentified person\u00a0recommending\u00a0candidates for agency jobs. Ironic twist: Now Trump's team has to deal with private email questions Report: Ivanka Trump sent hundreds of messages from personal email account, according to report The report\u00a0noted other\u00a0emails were from people who congratulated DeVos\u00a0or offered other job advice. House Democrats requested the review in October 2017, but the\u00a0inspector general\u2019s office said it began work\u00a0\u201cwell into 2018\u201d because of staffing challenges. Other Trump administration officials who have faced questions about private emails include Ivanka Trump,\u00a0Jared Kushner, former\u00a0chief of staff Reince Priebus and former senior adviser Steve Bannon.

Officials with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation have scheduled a joint news conference Thursday to announce details of the\u00a0decision. EPA officials sent the state a letter last week warning that the tougher emission rules violate federal law. Several other states had considered adopting California's standard, and four automakers \u2014 Ford, Volkswagen, BMW and Honda\u00a0\u2014 signed an agreement this summer embracing the lower emission requirements, drawing a rebuke from President Donald Trump.

      "author": "",
      "content": "This is a tale of two cynics: Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. They\u2019re equally volatile and dangerous, but they afflict their two nations differently. Trump is a president who says a hurricane is threatening\u00a0Alabama\u00a0when, actually, it isn't; who believes\u00a0wind turbines cause cancer;\u00a0who purges references to climate change in government reports;\u00a0and on, and on. He doesn\u2019t read,\u00a0and he\u00a0likes to be surrounded by ignoramuses. Few of his lieutenants are appointed for their expertise. Dr. Ben Carson, a former neurosurgeon, knows nothing about housing policy; Betsy DeVos is the Education secretary who visited the nation\u2019s largest school district and didn't stop at a single public school. And few of Trump\u2019s notions are original: They are the fancies of his evangelical-oligarchic-Fox News alliance, who believe that climate change is either nonexistent or part of the cosmic order of things,\u00a0that America is \u201cinfested\u201d by nonwhites, that open-carry laws save lives, and so on. But among eminences, Trump stands out as a weirdo. His contempt for knowledge would not fly at the top of a serious business. His economic advisers are outliers. And his reversals cause whiplash. When Trump named Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of State, for instance,\u00a0he commended him for his \u201ctenacity, broad experience and deep understanding of geopolitics.\u201d When he fired Tillerson after a year\u00a0in office, he tweeted that Tillerson was \u201cdumb as a rock\u201d and \u201clazy as hell.\u201d By contrast, the wild spins of Britain\u2019s new\u00a0prime minister, Boris Johnson, do not betray his class. They express its follies and foibles. Johnson and most of his predecessors learned the arts of debate, slapdash generalization\u00a0and high-level schmoozing at Oxford. They cultivated \u201cdebating skills and ambition without a cause,\u201d in the words of the Financial Times\u2019\u00a0Simon Kuper. Eventually, the future anti-Europe campaigners would forge what Kuper calls \u201ca cross-class alliance with (Brexit Party leader)\u00a0Nigel\u00a0Farage and the tabloids.\u201d Johnson even knows how to go lowbrow, having recently boasted: \u201cThe madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.\u201d Such cocky men (almost entirely men) stand for an entire class that journalists James Ball and Andrew Greenway write about in their book, \"Bluffocracy.\" They run Britain\u2019s politics, civil service\u00a0and media \u2014 \u201cpeople who are bluffing, winging it, obsessed with process over substance, and dominated by short-termism.\u201d Ball has referred to Johnson\u2019s career as \u201cthe politician-as-nihilist: a genteel version of Donald Trump\u2019s post-truth politics, reliant on charm to get away with an approach to the truth (that) could be set out as flexible.\u201d Trump was once charming, I\u2019m told, but he must have lost the knack. Certainly he never had the knack of argument. One difference between the British and American versions of fakery is that the Brits practice argument as a game. They tend to talk well and write well. Most attended fancy private schools (which, perversely, the Brits call \u201cpublic\u201d), before going on to Oxford, which serves as \u201cthe bluffer\u2019s finishing school.\u201d Unintended consequences: Trump is proving publicity can be bad. From Twitter to Fox News, he's walked into a trap. (Thus, en route to Oxford, Johnson headed Eton\u2019s debate team.) They learn how to defend any old proposition. (In 2016, Johnson, still a columnist, prepared two columns, one published and pro-Brexit, the other unpublished and anti-Brexit, to be ready for all contingencies.) At Oxford, they acquire a style of knowledge that, for them, is \u201canother form of trickery \u2014 intellect being a quality that should run\u00a0a mile wide, if only an inch deep.\u201d Actual skill and expertise are, in the bluffocracy canon,\u00a0disposable. As Michael Gove, Johnson\u2019s fellow Oxford University graduate and Cabinet minister, put it,\u00a0\u201cPeople in this country have had enough of experts.\u201d Never mind that a\u00a0University of Sheffield survey\u00a0\u2014 real data\u00a0\u2014\u00a0refutes his claim. In the long run, the UK's bluffocracy may prove even more toxic and deeply rooted than our own political afflictions. Anthony Barnett, writing in openDemocracy, cautions that\u00a0Johnson is not really an insouciant free spirit. However slapdash his maneuvers, such as comic photo opportunities with a bull and a kipper, there\u2019s an underlying consistency:\u00a0\"Their\u00a0aim (is) to encourage us to lower our guard and regard his government as irrational bluster and boosterism. Whereas he and his hedge-fund backers seek to turn us into the playthings of deregulated capitalism.\u201d Exit strategy:\u00a0A Donald Trump coup if he loses in 2020? With all the norms he's busted, don't rule it out In this sense, America could\u00a0get off relatively easy. Next year, Trump may be discarded as a whacked-out disturbance \u2014\u00a0if, once defeated, he agrees to go quietly. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t speak for a whole class; he embarrasses them as he enriches them. We have a Constitution, centuries old, and flawed, as it is. In principle, violations are punishable by Congress. Boris Johnson\u2019s crowd will prove harder to dislodge.

      "content": " DETROIT\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Michigan State University set a record it wants no part of \u2013 the most rapes reported by a university on its annual Clery Act report. There was\u00a0a total of 1,013 rapes reported across all campuses, most attributed to Larry Nassar. Clery Act report: MSU cited for 'serious noncompliance' with federal campus safety law related to Larry Nassar case Record fine: Michigan State to pay record $4.5 million fine in Larry Nassar sexual assault scandal That's a record for any higher education institution in one year, said S. Daniel Carter, president of Safety Advisors for Educational Campuses, who has\u00a0monitored\u00a0Clery Act reports since schools were required to start reporting crime stats in 1992. A decade ago, all campuses nationally reported\u00a0no more than 3,000 sexual assaults total, Carter said. Nassar was a doctor at Michigan State University, as well as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics. He was sentenced to 60 years in federal prison on child pornography charges. He faces a 40- to 175-year sentence issued in Ingham County, Michigan, and a 40- to 125-year sentence from Eaton County, Michigan, for sexual assaults. Those sentences will not begin until he finishes the federal sentence. The university settled lawsuits by more than 300 survivors with a payment of $500 million. Other lawsuits are pending from more than 100 people. Late last month, the university said in legal filings it shouldn't be held legally responsible for Nassar. \"Although Nassar\u2019s actions were repugnant and merit the heavy criminal penalties imposed upon him, the law does not support Plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to hold the MSU Defendants liable for his wrongs,\" the university said in a court filing of more than 100 pages, backed by nearly 900 pages of exhibits. Nassar survivor: She surrendered her secrets to put away a sexual predator. But her sacrifice isn't over Lou Anna Simon: Larry Nassar is guilty of sexual assault. Did Michigan State's ex-president lie to police about him? Other major universities reported\u00a0large numbers  after scandals involving doctors abusing and assaulting students. \"Ohio State University is facing a somewhat similar situation in the Dr. (Richard) Strauss case,\" Carter said. Strauss was a former wrestling team doctor at Ohio State. \"The University of Southern California is likewise bulk reporting incidents from their Dr. (George) Tyndall case,\" Carter said. Tyndall was a former campus gynecologist. Last month, Michigan State was fined $4.5 million \u2013 a record fine \u2013 for its failures in the Nassar case, including violations of the Clery Act, by the federal Department of Education. \"What happened at MSU was abhorrent. ...\u00a0So was the university's response to their crimes,\" U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said, referring to Nassar and his boss, William Strampel, former osteopathic college dean. The report said the school must hire an outside law firm to review all sex assault case decisions made by the school's Title IX office and issue a report to the federal government. MSU's board and president must receive a regular report of all cases and decisions. MSU must conduct a sweeping investigation into who knew what and didn't act on\u00a0Nassar or\u00a0Strampel, who was convicted of criminal charges. That includes former MSU President Lou Anna Simon, who faces\u00a0criminal charges of lying to police in the Nassar investigation; former Provost June Youatt, who knew for years of sexual harassment claims against Strampel and cleared him; along with the associate vice president for academic human resources;\u00a0employees of the Office of the General Counsel;\u00a0and the former head coach of the women's gymnastics team.

      "content": " Correction: A prior version of this story misspelled the name of\u00a0Mark Huelsman, an associate\u00a0director of Demos. About 2 in 3\u00a0members of the class of 2018 graduated\u00a0a little deeper in debt than the classes before them.\u00a0Last year\u2019s graduates with a bachelor\u2019s degree averaged about $29,200 in student loan debt\u00a0\u2013 a record in the USA. That is about a 2%\u00a0increase from the class of 2017, whose members graduated with an average debt of $28,650, according to a new report by the Institute for College Access and Success. The growth of student loan debt has slowed, but the institute said college affordability remains an \u201curgent concern.\u201d \"Millions of students continue to struggle with their debts,\" said the group's executive vice president, Debbie Cochrane. She credited states' investments in public colleges with the slower growth in debt loads. The conversation surrounding the nation\u2019s $1.6 trillion of student loan debt has never been louder. Democratic presidential hopefuls, including U.S. Sens.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0of\u00a0Massachusetts\u00a0and Bernie Sanders\u00a0of Vermont, proposed sweeping plans they said would eliminate billions in student loan debt while greatly reducing the price of college. Betsy DeVos on loan forgiveness: Rule change means college students must fight for forgiveness A few state schools\u00a0have tried introducing aid programs meant to ease the burden for low- and middle-income students, including the University of Michigan and University of Virginia. New York offers free tuition to residents who earn up to $125,000, and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham proposed a free tuition plan for any state resident who attends a public institution, regardless of income. Critics of such plans say a bachelor's degree generally results in higher lifetime earnings for students, and roughly $30,000 in debt may be a reasonable price to pay for the greater earning power it brings. They say money spent on \"free\" college might be better spent elsewhere, such as on health care. The Institute for College Success and Access\u00a0collected data from about half of all public and private, not-for-profit universities for its report, and it said the figures represent more than 70% of all graduates. (For-profit colleges were not included because\u00a0\"virtually no for-profit colleges report what their graduates owe.\") Some for-profit colleges have closed: How to keep it from happening to you The debt loads\u00a0vary heavily by region. Borrowers who attended college in the Northeast had the highest average debt, whereas those in the West graduated with the lowest. Connecticut had the highest average,\u00a0$38,650, and Utah had the lowest at $19,750. Black students and those from low-income backgrounds were more likely to have debt at graduation, the report says. About 17% of the debt comes from private student loans, which generally have higher interest rates\u00a0and fewer protections than those issued by the federal government. To reduce student debt loads, the institute offered numerous suggestions, including: If the method of paying for\u00a0higher education remains the same, average student debt is likely to continue to rise, according to Mark Huelsman, an associate director at Demos, a left-leaning think tank, who studies student debt. The slowed growth, he said, might be thanks to some\u00a0families' ability to\u00a0pay for college after rebuilding some of their wealth after the recession. Unemployment is low, which means people have jobs to help pay off their loans. A few decades ago, it was unusual to graduate with a lot of debt. The growth in debt loads is especially troubling, Huelsman said, given how diverse college students are\u00a0compared with\u00a0the predominately white classes of the past. \u201cWe have depressed ourselves into a mindset in which $30,000 in debt is acceptable for a degree,\u201d Huelsman said. Jason Delisle, a fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said he doesn\u2019t expect that figure to change substantially, even after the introduction of increased financial aid at public colleges. Students, he said, often use the loan money to help cover living expenses and other costs associated with college. Many students use federal loans to pay for private colleges, which are unlikely to be affected by free college plans. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of demand for loans that are a really good deal,\u201d thanks to low interest rates,\u00a0Delisle said. Monthly payments can be rather affordable, too, depending on the repayment option each borrower chooses. A typical borrower earning $35,000 and paying back a $29,200 federal loan could pay  $136 to $310 a month over 10 to 16 years, according to the federal government repayment calculator.

      "content": "ATLANTA \u2013 While Aaron Greene was packing to head back to Clark Atlanta University for his junior year, he stumbled upon a college bill at his mother\u2019s house in Stone Mountain, Georgia. The number was so large that he figured it had to be a phone number. \u201cI know my mother is not paying this much money for school,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that.\u201d Though his mother, Di-Anne, already had $40,000 in student loans from her own graduate school education, she has taken out $42,000 in Parent PLUS Loans for Aaron \u2013 and she had kept him in the dark about the cost. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give him the pressure of starting out in college, worrying about grades as well as the finances,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I probably should have (told him)\u00a0so that he could get a better understanding of the sacrifice that\u2019s been made.\u201d Student loans: Debt hits a new high in 2018, though growth slows Parent borrowing is a sacrifice many black parents make to pay for their children\u2019s college education, and it is especially prevalent among families whose children attend historically black colleges and universities. The federal government\u2019s Parent PLUS program helps make\u00a0attending college a reality, closing the gap between the cost of college and what the student receives in grants and other loans. Though it may sound like a lifeline, the Parent PLUS Loan program can cause economic complications for families. The loan program was introduced in the 1980s as a way for middle- and upper-income parents to help their children pay for college while keeping their assets liquid. It has since become more popular among lower-income parents. That's possible because the program does not check the ability to repay, considering only the borrower's credit history. When parents borrow, the debt can weigh down families for generations. But the burden falls particularly hard on low-income\u00a0black families. Few white families with low incomes take out the loan \u2013 just 10% of white Parent PLUS borrowers earn $30,000 or less. Comparatively, 40% of black Parent PLUS borrowers have incomes that low. Atlanta colleges illustrate this dichotomy of borrowing. Parents of students at three of the city\u2019s historically black colleges \u2013 Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College and Spelman College \u2013 combined took out more than $102 million in Parent PLUS Loans in 2018. Meanwhile, parents of students at majority-white Emory University \u2013 which has nearly the same number of students as those three historically black colleges and universities together \u2013 borrowed only $7 million in Parent PLUS Loans that year. Parents borrowing for their children\u2019s education isn\u2019t new. The program has existed long enough for families to see one of the consequences of taking out large loans: generations of overlapping debt. In Texas, Prairie View A&M University graduate Tania White needed her mother to take out Parent PLUS Loans for her undergraduate education 30 years ago. White\u2019s mother borrowed $12,000 for White\u2019s three years of college. She is still paying it back. Since White\u2019s graduation in 1992, her mother\u2019s debt has accrued to more than $100,000. White said the interest rate on Evans\u2019 $100,000 debt is about 9%. \u201cYou know how something is so outrageous where you have no expression or feeling behind it? That\u2019s where we are with that,\u201d White said, remarking that paying back student debt has become a routine for her family. Loan forgiveness: Betsy DeVos rule change means college students must fight for it Despite seeing her mother\u2019s debt accumulate, White resorted to Parent PLUS Loans to pay for her daughter\u2019s trip to study abroad. White now owes more than $200,000 between her own and her children\u2019s student debt. This generational pattern of borrowing is not uncommon, since the Parent PLUS program casts debt across all generations \u2013 not just young people affected by federal student loans. \u201cWe wanted to be the group that breaks generational poverty,\u201d said Joy Evans, mother of a Paul Quinn College graduate, referring to her family\u2019s three generations of college loan borrowing. Intergenerational student debt may be a product of the length of time it takes families to repay the hefty loans. Parent PLUS Loans often take five to 20 years to repay because many of the borrowers are approaching retirement age, leaving less opportunity for promotions or time for them to accumulate enough money. As a result, some parents said they hope their children will help pay off the PLUS Loans after they graduate. For instance, one father took out Parent PLUS Loans for his youngest daughter to attend Coppin State University in Baltimore. \u201cI\u2019m concerned and a little worried about the debt,\u201d said Perry Collins. But \u201cit is our hope that (our children)\u00a0will get to the point where they can provide for themselves.\u201d Collins said his debt is accumulating quickly between a mortgage and his children\u2019s student loans. He hopes his children will help pay off the debt. This woman's dad couldn't help her: She paid off over $222K in student debt anyway. This is how she did it. Families that attend HBCUs are a prime example of the program\u2019s consequences, Collins said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the less privileged and less wealthy that are sending their children out to these things and that\u2019s their only means in most cases.\u201d Parent PLUS Loans may add another struggle: instant repayment. Unlike federal student loans, parent borrowers are expected to immediately begin repaying the loan. Depending on how much they owe, the amount could take decades to pay back, furthering the chance of debt overlapping across generations. Morehouse mother Vanessa Manley predicted it will take her and her husband 15 to 20 years to pay back their $30,000 in Parent PLUS Loans, but the loans were worth the investment. \u201cSome parents invest in material things. I invest in my child,\u201d Manley said. Her son started at Morehouse in fall 2019. For many parents, the value of sending their child to an HBCU is worth any cost. They see these institutions as pathways to success. Roderick Hester just dropped off his third daughter at Spelman College. He took out Parent PLUS Loans for each of them. \u201cIf this will give my child the best opportunity to be successful in life,\u201d he said, \u201cThis was the avenue I had to pursue. There wasn't a lot of options.\u201d Hester owes more than $200,000 in Parent PLUS Loans. \u201cI don't really know how I'm going to pay it back, but I'm planning on it,\u201d Hester said. \u201cWhatever I need to do is what I have to do.\u201d Some parents consider HBCUs a unique opportunity for their children to experience a predominantly black environment. In order to pay for her son\u2019s first two years at Morehouse, Carmelita Farrah borrowed $70,000 in Parent PLUS Loans. The idea that he would \u201cexperience his heritage\u201d at Morehouse trumped her financial strain. \u201cThe obstacles are stacked against him as a black man, so what will set them apart?\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully an education. After that, a career. Because it\u2019s a struggle. It really is.\u201d At Morehouse\u2019s graduation ceremony last May, billionaire Morehouse alum Robert Smith brought national attention to the student loan problem at HBCUs when he made a surprise announcement at graduation: He said he would pay off every 2019 graduate\u2019s student loans. Morehouse later said that gift would include Parent PLUS Loans. Student debt: What about those of us without a billionaire? Frank Lawrence Jr., a Morehouse Alumni Association member and 2019 graduate whose debts were cleared by Smith\u2019s gift, said the Alumni Association is \u201ctrying to encourage more alumni to give back.\u201d Other HBCUs have employed their own strategies to reduce student debt. In 2015, Paul Quinn College implemented a work-study model. The number of parents borrowing PLUS Loans has decreased over the four years since the program\u2019s launch, according to President Michael Sorrell. In addition to institutions trying to lower college debt, the nonprofit United Negro College Fund reported that this year alone, it is providing nearly $100 million in scholarships to more than 7,200 students of color. Not every student wins a scholarship, though. \u201cLoans are almost necessary without any scholarships, but students and their families have to shop around to find the best loans for them,\u201d said Brian Bridges, UNCF\u2019s vice president of research and member engagement. \u201cParent PLUS Loans are an essential college financing option for some students and parents that can be improved; however, the program must be repaired, not repealed,\u201d Bridges added. Other experts agree that the Parent PLUS program should be improved. The program is \u201cdoing a huge disservice to students of color and families of color when we\u2019re saying that they can borrow however much they want,\u201d said Colleen Campbell, director for postsecondary education at the liberal think tank American Progress. Campbell added that families should not be allowed to spend more than they can contribute. \u201cIf a family can only contribute $5,000 to their student\u2019s education in a year,\u201d Campbell said, \u201cthat\u2019s probably the amount you should allow them to borrow.\u201d For families that have used the federal Direct PLUS Loans, or are considering the loan, experts offer advice about how to navigate the process and make decisions appropriate for their specific case.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. Education Department is rescinding an Obama-era rule that aimed to police ineffective for-profit colleges. Department officials said Friday that the 2014 gainful employment rule will be removed entirely effective July 1, 2020. The rule sought to cut federal funding for programs that consistently left graduates with high debt compared to their incomes. The department's announcement says the rule focused too much on student earnings and unfairly targeted for-profit colleges. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, said that removing the rule rather than revising it \"will prop up low-quality for-profit colleges at the expense of students and taxpayers.\" A worthless degree?: Betsy DeVos wants to change rules for colleges College closed, leaving graduates no degree: How to keep it from happening to you The rule has never been enforced by the Education Department, which says it no longer has access to earnings data from the Social Security Administration.

      "content": " Going to Brightwood College in the 2018 fall semester was supposed to be a safe bet. So thousands of students enrolled across the country. For those students and others, a degree is supposed to be a lifeline. They sink in time and money that could be spent in the workforce, all for the prospect of higher earnings and a more fulfilling career. But Brightwood students\u2019 investment didn\u2019t pay off. What\u2019s more, a regulatory group had signed off on the college\u2019s programs \u2013 only to change its mind. Accreditation, as it\u2019s called, is meant to prevent predatory or shoddy schools from leading students astray. And the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools\u00a0had given its signal to\u00a0students that Brightwood was a worthwhile investment. Yet in December 2018, the agency revoked the accreditation of Education Corp. of America, which ran the Brightwood locations and other colleges\u00a0across the country. The closures of dozens of institutions followed swiftly. Students had spent the time and money\u00a0but\u00a0still had no\u00a0degrees\u00a0and no clear path forward. Don't be one of them: A college closed, leaving thousands without a degree. How to keep it from happening to you Many of them still struggle. In a Facebook group\u00a0for students of the closed college, some commiserate over what they call worthless degrees. Others try to give advice about how to get their student loan discharged or receive their transcripts. What\u2019s more, the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had a checkered history itself. President Barack Obama's\u00a0administration had moved to strip it of its powers to OK school programs, but after a legal battle, President Donald Trump's administration undid that move. The Education Corp. of America colleges were just some of the institutions\u00a0that suddenly closed in recent years. ITT Tech closed in 2016. Corinthian\u00a0Colleges did the same in 2015. Both had been accredited by ACICS. The accrediting group said it gave multiple warnings, but the colleges weren't able to meet its standards. What happened?: The trouble at for-profit colleges, in 5 graphs Now, the Education Department is looking to change the arcane and bureaucratic process of accreditation. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u00a0\u00a0and accreditors of universities say new rules will ultimately allow colleges to offer programs more quickly and effectively. That means students landing a job in fields that are hiring, they say. \u201cWith these reforms, our nation\u2019s colleges and universities can spend more time and effort on serving students and less time, energy, and money focused on bureaucratic compliance,\u201d DeVos said in a statement. Critics of the newly proposed rules say they would make it easier for shady colleges to operate for longer and with less federal oversight. Many colleges are already doing a poor job of preparing students, said Clare McCann\u00a0of the think tank New America. Giving them more latitude under the guise of innovation may lead to students taking chances on junk programs, she argued. \u201cWhat these regulations really do is make it so it is\u00a0much harder to hold those schools accountable,\u201d\u00a0McCann said. If anything, the government\u00a0should hold these agencies to a higher standard, she said. The public has until July 12 to give feedback on the proposed changes. Here\u2019s what you should know. Did your college close?\u00a0Why Brightwood College, Virginia College closed \u2014 and what students should do To receive federal money, universities must\u00a0meet the quality standards of an accrediting organization. According to the Education Department, these agencies ensure schools have\u00a0\u201cqualified instructors, an adequate curriculum, and necessary support services\u201d for students. In other words, they\u2019re meant to prevent students from ending up with worthless degrees. Accreditation can essentially be seen as a seal of quality for students, the government and even future employers. And students atunaccredited colleges can\u2019t access federal money in the form of student loans. The government doesn\u2019t directly accredit schools, but the Department of Education does decide who is and isn\u2019t fit to be an accreditor. The new rules were agreed upon by\u00a0department officials, accreditors, college leaders\u00a0and students during several negotiation sessions. Among the changes, the proposed rules would allow colleges to offer new programs with less scrutiny from accreditors. The idea is that colleges could see a hole in the workforce and quickly come up with a new degree or credential to fill it.\u00a0Accrediting agencies and for-profit colleges like this proposed change. Under the current rules, it may take months to make changes to a program\u2019s curriculum, said Judith Eaton, president of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. The group is made up of 3,000 colleges, and it\u00a0focuses on accreditation.\u00a0The new rules, she argued, would mean a less onerous process for accreditors when dealing with the federal government. And, she said, the new rules may make it so that universities feel free to experiment with, for example, new credentialing programs or increased online courses. If a college or accrediting group abused the new rules, the Education Department should crack down quickly, she said. The proposed rules would also allow schools that have failed to meet accreditation standards up to four years to fix their problems \u2013 double the previous amount of two years. The rationale? These changes sometimes take a long time, and allowing the university to fix a problem may lead to more students graduating. Closing an underperforming\u00a0college right away, in contrast, may leave those students without an education and nowhere to go to finish their degree. That\u00a0is a change welcomed by Nicholas Kent, a vice president at Career Education Colleges and Universities, a group of for-profit colleges. Critics have said the measure may allow bad colleges to do more damage, but Kent called that description \u201cdisingenuous,\u201d saying different programs will have different needs. A nine-month certificate program, he said, will need less time to fix a problem\u00a0compared with a 6-year-doctoral program. And he said accreditors are not required to give four years to everyone. Instead, they have the discretion to do so, and they can set up other check-ins. But allowing a bad institution to operate longer may mean more students attend the failing institution, wasting time and money. And it could\u00a0cost taxpayers more money\u00a0because the school could continue to get federal grants and loans,\u00a0Antoinette Flores, an associate director at the liberal Center for American Progress, has argued. Plus, she said, the proposed rules could make it easier for outside entities to buy failing colleges. The Department of Education wants to limit a new owner's liability. \u201cIn practice, that means we\u2019re never going to see any of these institutions going away,\u201d Flores said. \u201cThat increases the likelihood we\u2019re recycling failed, toxic assets in the system, and we\u2019re never really\u00a0getting rid of the lowest performances.\u201d Want to review the proposed rules yourself? \u00a0Visit the Federal Register,\u00a0where the proposal is\u00a0available in its entirety. The period for public comment ends July 12, so if you have an opinion, file it on the Federal Register's website. Any rule changes would follow the public comment period.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. Department of Education issued new rules late Friday that could make it more difficult for students to get federal loan forgiveness \u00a0if they attended colleges that close suddenly. The rules,\u00a0which have been known as \"borrower defense,\"\u00a0have been the subject of controversy for much of Betsy DeVos\u2019 turn as education secretary. She has long sought to overturn the 2016 rules from former President Barack\u00a0Obama's administration on the grounds that it was too easy for students to seek loan forgiveness. The new rules would require student borrowers to provide more evidence that they had been misled about the college\u2019s outlook and, as a result, can\u2019t find employment.\u00a0It also shifts more of the responsibility onto students to vet the colleges they attend. \u201cI called for this regulatory reset more than two years ago, as it became clear the old rules just weren\u2019t working,\u201d DeVos said in a news release. \u201cWe believe this final rule corrects the wrongs of the 2016 rule through common sense and carefully crafted reforms that hold colleges and universities accountable and treat students and taxpayers fairly.\u201d The new rules apply to loans issued on or after July 1, 2020. The department said the changes would save roughly $11 billion over the next decade \u2013 in part because the feds would forgive fewer loans. DeVos is pushing the changes while the\u00a0national discussion about student loans has never been louder. The nation has about $1.6 trillion in student loan debt, and several Democratic presidential hopefuls have rolled out\u00a0student loan forgiveness into their platforms. One plan:How much does Warren's debt forgiveness plan cost? A lot. Upping the stakes:\u00a0What's different about Bernie Sanders' student loan plan? It would help more rich people Critics were quick to voice their concerns on Friday, warning\u00a0borrowers might struggle to get the Education Department to agree to forgive their loans.\u00a0The Project on Predatory Student Lending went so far as to say it would have to sue to prevent the rules from taking effect. The department argued the new rules would save taxpayer money while still protecting those who might have been genuinely defrauded. The department also said the new rules discourage borrowers from making false claims in an attempt to game the system. Among the many changes in the 846-page document, borrowers now must apply for loan forgiveness if their college closes suddenly. Before, they were automatically eligible for forgiveness. (The window for applying for forgiveness after a school closes\u00a0has been extended to 180 days instead of\u00a0the prior 120.) Groups of people \u2013 such as whole classes at a college that\u2019s closing \u2013 no longer can file for forgiveness, as they had been able to in the past. Borrowers will also have to provide evidence they searched for a job, including emails that would confirm they had applied for work or attended a career fair. A version of the\u00a0borrower-defense rules had been in place since 1995, but they weren\u2019t widely used until 2015. That\u2019s about the same time the for-profit Corinthians College closed abruptly, leaving thousands of students with millions in debt. The DeVos department has argued the Obama administration expanded the rules to serve these students. As of March 2019, roughly 180,000 applications\u00a0for debt forgiveness were awaiting approval, despite court rulings in 2018 ordering the department to act. DeVos has spent much of her time as education secretary focusing on school choice for children. Her emphasis in the higher education sector has been reducing regulations. Critics have said these moves disproportionately benefit for-profit colleges. Earlier this summer, DeVos\u2019 department repealed a rule that would have barred federal money to institutions that burden their graduates with high levels of debt compared with their actual earnings. DeVos has also pushed to loosen the federal rules surrounding college accreditation. The department argued less bureaucratic rigmarole will mean colleges can more quickly place students in high-demand jobs, while critics have said laxer standards could leave students more indebted with worthless degrees. For-profits have attracted close public scrutiny in recent years due to the high-profile and sudden closure of several institutions. In addition to Corinithians, ITT closed in 2016 and the Education Corp. of America\u2019s 75 campuses shut their doors in 2018. Most recently, Argosy University closed earlier this year, leaving thousands of students in the lurch.

      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is\u00a0unlikely to go to jail, but the internet might have you think otherwise. The furor online stems\u00a0from a case involving the now-defunct Corinthian\u00a0College, a for-profit college that closed in 2015. The\u00a0U.S. Department of Education had been ordered\u00a0to stop collecting on the federal loans of students who attended the school. But the departmentdisclosed it had continued to\u00a0garnish wages and seize tax returns of hundreds of borrowers. Others had erroneously paid money toward the loans when they didn't have to. The judge's order is part of a lawsuit by former students at Corinthian College, who are suing the department with the hope of discharging their student loans. Colleges keep closing: Their students are left without degrees. How to keep it from happening to you Sallie Kim, a federal magistrate judge in California, admonished the department on Monday during a hearing. Among her remarks, she said: \"I am not sending anyone to jail yet, but it\u2019s good to know that I have that ability.\u201d Some interpreted those remarks as though DeVos herself might be facing jail time. And several news outlets\u00a0ran headlines linking DeVos to time behind bars. In a written order issued Tuesday, Kim wrote the court would consider if\u00a0\u201ca finding of contempt, or monetary sanctions, or both are warranted.\u201d Her order does not mention jail time. Contempt of court can end in fines or jail time, but people usually obey the court's rule before that. It's hard to see DeVos doing otherwise. In fact, the judge has already given DeVos an out. In her Tuesday ruling, Kim\u00a0asked both the Education Department and the former Corinthian students to submit responses to the possibility of a contempt order. She also asked them to give some ideas of how the department could \"remedy\" its illegal collection of student loan payments from the former students and ensure it didn't happen again. Angela L. Morabito, the press secretary\u00a0for the\u00a0Education Department, said the agency does not comment on ongoing litigation, and that\u00a0\u00a0\"we are working to faithfully comply with the judge\u2019s orders in this case.\" And in previous court filings, the department\u00a0wrote it was letting borrowers know about the error and issuing refunds. During her tenure as President Donald Trump's education secretary, DeVos has always attracted\u00a0fierce controversy. She\u00a0has become especially reviled by critics on the left for her support of school choice and for rolling back federal regulations in higher education.
