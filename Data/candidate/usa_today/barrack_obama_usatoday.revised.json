      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden defended his son\u00a0Hunter, who he said will be part of Biden's campaign for president. \"I knew it was going to be this way,\" Biden said in an interview with the Reno Gazette Journal on Wednesday night after\u00a0a campaign stop in Reno. Biden said he knew his family would come under attack, but after a sit-down with his five grandchildren three weeks before announcing he was entering the race, he made the decision. \"They came to me and said, 'Pop, you got to run.'\" When Biden said it would get really mean, his grandchildren responded, \"We know how he is,\" they said about President Donald Trump, \"but, Pop you got to do it.\" Hunter Biden\u00a0has come under scrutiny after Trump asked the Ukrainian president to Biden. Trump claims that Biden tried to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating a company where Hunter Biden served on the board. But sources ranging from former Obama administration officials to an anti-corruption advocate\u00a0in Ukraine\u00a0say the official,\u00a0Viktor Shokin, was ousted\u00a0for the opposite reason Trump\u00a0and his allies claim. Impeachment pressure: Trump says China should investigate Joe Biden, family On Wednesday, Trump called Biden and his son \"stone cold crooked.\" But Biden fiercely defended his family during the Reno campaign rally. \u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me. I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said. \"I think it's the beginning not the end,\u201d Biden said about what he anticipates will be more attacks against his family. \"I'm also confident the American people know me, and they know my son.\" Biden said his son will be a visible part of the campaign. Ukraine explained: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases \"He's a fine man. He's been through hell.\" Biden's wife and infant daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972, just weeks after he won his first Senate race. \u00a0In 2015, his oldest son Beau\u00a0Biden, 46, died from a deadly form of brain cancer. Biden said Trump\u2019s attacks are tough but won\u2019t stop him from winning come November. \"Look, we are a family. We have been through a lot worse,\" Biden said.\u00a0\"We know what real pain is.\" Impeachment poll: By 45%-38%, Americans support impeaching him over Ukraine allegations, poll finds Biden talked about the tragedy of losing his son to cancer. When asked about Reno mom Kristin Sumbot, who he met at a hospital in 2016, Biden remembered her. \"I should call her,\" Biden said about Sumbot\u2019 s mother. He then called her twice including during the end of an interview with the RGJ and then later from his car back to the airport.

Sumbot died in 2017 after being diagnosed with the same deadly form of \u00a0brain cancer that killed Beau Biden, but her family credited the clinical trial for giving her an extra six months. \u201cIf I'm elected president it is going to be one of the overwhelming priorities,\u201d Biden said of cancer research and how investments can chance cancer survival rates. \u00a0\"It is one of the missions of my life.\u201d Siobhan McAndrew tells stories about the people of Northern Nevada and covers education in Washoe County.",

      "content": "   WILMINGTON, Del.\u00a0\u2013\u00a0He's been featured in countless newspaper articles, and even got his own New Yorker profile. Some might enjoy that kind of exposure, but it's been a major headache for Hunter Biden \u2013 and for his father Joe's presidential campaign. It's nothing new. The former vice president's middle child has long faced public scrutiny, much of it while his father was still in office. Hunter Biden is the younger son of Joe Biden and Neilia Hunter, who married in 1966. They had three children \u2013 Beau, Hunter and Naomi \u2013 before Neilia and Naomi were killed in a car crash in 1972. Joe went on to marry Jill in 1977, and the couple had their daughter, Ashley, in 1981. Hunter, like his dad and brother, went to Archmere Academy. He graduated from Georgetown University and Yale Law School. Hunter Biden has three children, Naomi, Finnegan and Maisey, with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle. In 2016, Hunter Biden began dating Hallie Biden, the widow of his brother, Beau. His parents supported the couple. In 2017, they said, \"We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness. They have (our)\u00a0full and complete support and we are happy for them.\u201d When asked to comment on his family life for a January 2019 article in Vanity Fair, Hunter Biden wrote: \"Even though my life has been played out in the media, because I am a Biden, my father never once suggested that the family's public profile should be my priority. The priority has always been clear for my dad, as it is, now, for me: Never run from a struggle. Love people and find a way to love yourself.\" In May, Hunter Biden met Melissa Cohen, a 32-year-old South African filmmaker. Less than a week later, he proposed. The Biden family was not at the wedding. Hunter told The New Yorker of his father's support for the marriage. Read the full\u00a0declassified text of the Trump whistleblower complaint Complaint released: Whistleblower says Trump used 'the power of his office' to solicit foreign help to discredit Joe Biden, complaint says \u201cI called my dad and said that we just got married. He was on speaker, and he said to her, 'Thank you for giving my son the courage to love again.' \u201cAnd he said to me, 'Honey, I knew that when you found love again that I'd get you back ... And my reply was, I said, 'Dad, I always had love. And the only thing that allowed me to see it was the fact that you never gave up on me, you always believed in me.' \" In 2013, Hunter Biden was selected to be a direct commission officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve, but was discharged months later after he tested positive for cocaine. That wasn't the first time drugs and alcohol took a toll on his life. In the New Yorker profile, Hunter Biden opened up about his struggle with alcohol and drugs. \u201cLook, everybody faces pain,\u201d he said in the story. \u201cEverybody has trauma. There's addiction in every family. I was in that darkness. I was in that tunnel \u2013 it's a never-ending tunnel. You don't get rid of it. You figure out how to deal with it.\u201d Although Joe Biden, who had relatives with alcohol problems, has never had a drink, Hunter Biden started drinking alcohol as a teenager. The story describes how he occasionally used cocaine while a student at Georgetown, even once buying crack. In the early 2000s, he tried to get sober, including rehab in 2003. He relapsed in 2010, after seven years of sobriety, when he had drinks during a business trip. Hunter Biden then told his brother, Beau, and he returned to rehab. But after suffering from shingles, for which he was prescribed painkillers, he started drinking again. Baseless accusations?\u00a0Trump's efforts to discredit Joe Biden backfired on him. Will they hurt the former VP anyway? July 25 call: 'I would like you to do us a favor.' What Trump and Zelensky said in their phone call After Beau died in 2015, Hunter Biden began doing yoga, but also continued to drink heavily. \"Several times a day, his father called him, and Hunter assured him that he was OK. Eventually, Biden showed up unannounced at the apartment,\" The New Yorker reported. \"Hunter said that his father told him, 'I need you. What do we have to do?' \" In the fall of 2016, Hunter Biden arranged to go to rehab in Sedona, Arizona. During an unexpected layover in Los Angeles, he bought crack several times that week, The New Yorker reported. After days of not sleeping, on Oct. 28, Hunter was driving on Interstate 10 near Palm Springs and eventually lost control of the car. He eventually dropped off the rental car and called the rehab center to pick him up. Shortly after the article was published last summer, Joe and Jill Biden commented on it during an interview on CNN. \"Beau was my soul, Hunter is my heart,\" Joe Biden said. \"Hunter has been through some tough times, but he's fighting.\" Hunter Biden is a lawyer and founder of the venture capital firm Eudora Global, which specializes in health care, online gambling and renewable energy. But that's not why he's been in the spotlight recently. In 2014, Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company. During his tenure, Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin investigated the company. Joe Biden: I never talked to son Hunter about overseas business dealings Put focus on Trump: Biden campaign to media: Focus on 'dishonest' Trump, not Hunter Biden The New York Times reported in May that Joe Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, Shokin, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board. Shokin was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. But Yuriy Lutsenko, a former Ukraine prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden or Hunter Biden. \u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2013 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,\u201d Lutsenko told Bloomberg. \u201cA company can pay however much it wants to its board.\u201d Trump admission: He delayed aid for Ukraine but says he didn't do it to force a Biden investigation Hunter Biden told the Times in May that he had \"no role whatsoever\" in the Ukrainian investigation of the company or any of its officers. The Washington Post has reported there is \"no evidence\" Joe Biden was trying to help his son. As President Donald Trump criticized the Bidens, the former vice president swung back, appearing in Wilmington on Tuesday to state that he supports the impeachment of Trump if the White House does not comply with Congress' requests for details about a call he made to Ukraine's president in which they discussed the former vice president. On Wednesday, the president released notes about the call. Trump campaign officials also fought back prior to Joe Biden's speech, sending out a list of questions that they said Biden should answer. It included \"an explanation for why he believes it was appropriate for Hunter (Biden) to make millions of dollars in Ukraine at the same time Joe Biden was leading diplomatic relations with Ukraine.\" Contributing: Bart Jansen, USA TODAY.

Biden, speaking with reporter Amy Robach at his Los Angeles home, described\u00a0his dealings with the company, Burisma, as \"poor judgment\" on his part that\u00a0\"gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father,\" former Vice President Joe Biden.

Ukraine: Ukraine to review investigation of company tied to Hunter Biden \"You know what, I'm a human, did I make a mistake? Maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah. But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not,\" he said. \"It's crazy,\" Biden said of the political hay that has been made of his role with Burisma. as well as his business dealings in China. \"They feel like they have the license to go out and say whatever they want. It feels to me like living in some kind of 'Alice in Wonderland.'\" Biden said he felt he was qualified to sit on Burisma's board\u00a0but acknowledged that he would \"probably not\" have been offered the seat\u00a0were it not for the fact that his father was vice president. Hunter Biden: Hunter Biden will resign from board of Chinese firm, says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president \"I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happened in\u00a0my life if my last name wasn't Biden,\" he said. He said that he never discussed Burisma with his father except for one \"brief exchange\" when the elder Biden said, \"I hope you know what you're doing,\" after seeing news reports that his son\u00a0had joined the company's board. \"I made a mistake in retrospect as it related to creating any perception that it was wrong,\" Biden said of his decision.

      "content": " KIEV, Ukraine\u00a0\u2014 Ukraine\u2019s top legal official said Friday that his office would review\u00a0a probe into the owner of a natural-gas company linked to former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son. Ruslan Ryaboshapka, Ukraine\u2019s general prosecutor, said during a press conference\u00a0that the review is part of a wider audit of at least 15 high-profile past investigations that were closed or dismissed by his predecessors. The announcement Friday comes as an impeachment inquiry over President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine consumes Washington. But Ryaboshapka said the decision to review the cases was not specifically related to the time Hunter Biden spent on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private natural-gas firm, or allegations from the Trump administration that Joe Biden\u00a0improperly applied pressure on Ukraine to have an investigation into Burisma halted. The allegations from Trump and his lawyer Rudolph Giuliani have played a key role in\u00a0the impeachment inquiry into Trump by Democratic lawmakers. Ukraine:Text messages show U.S. diplomats believed U.S. aid was linked to Trump's demand for Biden probe Ukraine\u2019s previous general prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, closed a money-laundering and tax-irregularity probe into Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, in 2016. The case did not focus on Hunter Biden. There is also no evidence that Joe\u00a0Biden acted improperly in applying pressure on Ukraine to dismiss Lutsenko\u2019s predecessor, Viktor Shokin. Shokin was widely and publicly viewed by international organizations such as the European Union and International Monetary Fund, and anti-corruption investigators in Ukraine, as an impediment to reforming the country\u2019s culture of graft. Ryaboshapka said the audit has been planned since he took office one month ago. Friday\u2019s press conference was his first public one since taking up the role. Impeachment testimony: Intelligence watchdog to testify about 'credible' whistleblower complaint before key House committee Vitali Kasko, Ryaboshapha\u2019s deputy, told USA TODAY after the news conference that an affidavit by Shokin highlighted in recent days by Giuliani\u2019s office that claims he was fired in 2016 because he was leading a \u201cwide-ranging corruption investigation\u201d into Burisma had no merit. \u201cShokin is not a reliable figure,\u201d he said. Shokin was not available for comment.",

At the time of the phone call, the White House was holding up a military aid package Congress had approved for Ukraine. During a press conference earlier in the day, Trump slammed the Bidens\u00a0as \u201cstone cold crooked,\u201d and vented on Twitter, saying that Democrats are \"wasting everyone\u2019s time and energy.\" 'Did you hear me?': Furious Donald Trump blasts media over Ukraine, impeachment inquiry \u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me \u2013 I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said in Reno. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me.

He also did not answer a question about what he wanted Ukraine President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky to do about Biden. Trump continued his defense Wednesday night, accusing Democrats of trying to steal the election, and posted a video about Joe and Hunter Biden, featuring the song \"Photograph\" by Nickelback and a 2014 picture of the duo with\u00a0Devon Archer, who also served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings. Biden continued to call Trump \"desperate and defensive,\" pointing out the president's comments\u00a0about the whistleblower being executed, wanting to\u00a0prosecute the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee for treason,\u00a0and warning of a civil war. \"The world can\u2019t wait for America to once again lead a stable, peaceful international order,\" Biden concluded Wednesday.",

      "content": " In a statement released through his attorney Sunday morning, Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, said he would resign from the board of a Chinese company and pledged not to serve on boards of foreign companies if Joe Biden were elected president. Hunter Biden had received criticism from President Donald Trump and Republicans for his work on foreign boards as House Democrats escalated an impeachment inquiry into Trump for pressuring the Ukrainian government into opening an investigation into Hunter Biden. Trump has also said China should investigate Hunter Biden, though the Chinese government has said publicly that it would not. USA TODAY has spoken to two dozen leaders and investigators in Ukraine who say\u00a0 Trump's accusations against Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine are baseless. George Mesires, Hunter Biden's attorney, wrote in a statement posted on\u00a0Medium that Hunter Biden had decided to\u00a0resign his seat on the board of the Chinese investment firm BHR. Mesires said Biden had not received any compensation for being on the board, nor did he receive any equity in it while Joe Biden was vice president. \"To date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR\u2019s board of directors,\" Mesires wrote. \"He has not received any return on his investment; there have been no distributions to BHR shareholders since Hunter obtained his equity interest. Moreover, Hunter played no role in directing or making BHR\u2019s investments.\" Mesires said Hunter Biden was going to resign from the BHR board by Oct. 31. More: Trump's conspiracy theories thrive in Ukraine, where a young democracy battles corruption and distrust According to Mesires, \"Hunter undertook these business activities independently,\" never discussed them with Joe Biden, and \"When Hunter engaged in his business pursuits, he believed that he was acting appropriately and in good faith.\" Hunter Biden \"never anticipated the barrage of false charges\" from Trump, Mesires wrote. If Joe Biden were elected president in 2020, Hunter Biden pledged \"not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies\" and comply with all ethics and guidelines related to conflicts of interest,\u00a0Mesires concluded. Joe Biden has defended his son on the campaign trail and has said Hunter Biden would serve a visible role on his 2020 campaign. \"He's a fine man. He's been through hell,\" Joe Biden said of his son in an Oct. 3 interview with the Reno Gazette-Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.",

      "content": "   MINNEAPOLIS\u00a0\u2013 Breaking out a new stump speech amid the ongoing impeachment inquiry into his interactions with Ukraine, President Donald Trump on Thursday delivered an extended attack\u00a0on rival Joe Biden while largely ignoring the rest of the Democratic field. Frequently raising unsubstantiated claims, Trump mostly bypassed his standard lines touting the economy and his get-tough stance on immigration in favor of offering supporters a series of broadsides against the former vice president, hometown Rep.\u00a0Ilhan Omar and congressional Democrats probing his White House. Trump's retooled remarks in a state he lost narrowly to Hillary Clinton in 2016 came as he is facing a widening impeachment inquiry into whether he pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden by withholding foreign aid. Trump, who has denied doing so,\u00a0has sought to shift attention to Biden and his son, Hunter. \"He was never considered a good senator,\" Trump said of Biden. \"He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\" The former vice president, who spoke Thursday at an LGBTQ town hall sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign and CNN,\u00a0later responded on Twitter, saying\u00a0\"I spent my night at the HRC forum talking about the fundamental respect every human being deserves. You spent yours showing how little respect for anyone else you have.\" Explainer: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases More: A visual timeline of the text messages in the Trump-Ukraine affair The Trump campaign has tried for days to focus voters' attention\u00a0on Hunter Biden, who had business dealings in Ukraine and China.\u00a0Trump, without offering evidence, said that\u00a0Hunter Biden was hired by companies in other countries because of his last name, and his father's position as vice president, rather than his business acumen. \"Whatever happened to\u00a0Hunter? Where the hell is he?\" Trump said, as current Vice President Mike Pence and Karen Pence watched from just off stage. The line was clearly a point officials close to Trump wanted to emphasize.\u00a0Midway through his remarks, Trump's campaign began selling t-shirts emblazoned with the words \"Where's Hunter?\" Trump's attacks on Biden came during an unusually long address\u00a0\u2013 running over an hour and a half\u00a0\u2013 in which\u00a0he also blasted the city's mayor for forbidding police officers to wear uniforms to his rally and touted efforts to reduce the number of refugees resettled\u00a0in U.S. cities. Before Trump took the stage, the crowd chanted \"lock him up,\" reprising a taunt his supporters often used against Clinton in 2016 but aiming it at Biden. Joe Biden, who called for\u00a0Trump's impeachment earlier in the week, accused the president of \"shooting holes in the Constitution.\" \"Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts,\" Biden said Wednesday. \"His lying is matched only by his manifest incompetence as president.\" Andrew Bates, rapid response director for Biden's campaign, tweeted that Trump's \"presidency\u2019s spiraling after he was caught trying to force a foreign country to lie about the candidate who terrifies him, and apparently this is all he\u2019s got left.\" Biden\u2019s lead in national polling has slipped amid the back-and-forth with Trump as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has steadily increased her support. The president also renewed his attacks on Omar, D-Minn., who represents much of Minneapolis. At one point, the president described\u00a0Omar as a \"American-hating socialist.\u201d Trump has previously claimed that Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government\u00a0to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into a company tied to Hunter Biden. But an anti-corruption advocate\u00a0in Ukraine and others have countered that the official was ousted\u00a0because he wasn't pursuing corruption aggressively enough. Contributing: Jeanine Santucci",

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has taken over the top spot in several recent national presidential primary polls as candidates prepare to debate\u00a0Oct. 15. Most national polls since the end of September have found Warren \u2013 not former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0\u2013\u00a0leading the pack, but by relatively narrow margins. Biden had led in almost every national poll, usually by double digits,\u00a0going back to 2018. But Warren has come out on top in four of the past five\u00a0and six of\u00a0the past 10. And she recently pulled ahead in the RealClearPolitics average, a frequently cited polling benchmark. Though she is in front of Biden only by 0.2%, it marks the first time Biden has not held the lead in the race's RCP average since the site began comparing\u00a0the polls\u00a0in December. The most recent poll to place her at the top was released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University. That poll found her ahead of Biden 29%-26%. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont came in third at 16%. Among those who described themselves as \"very liberal,\" Warren led Biden 38%-26%, and among the \"somewhat\" liberals she led 37%-23%. Biden led among moderate and conservative Democrats 35%-22%. Democratic primary: Elizabeth Warren is on the rise and so is the criticism from her Democratic rivals \"Warren maintains her strength in the Democratic primary, which has been consistently growing since the start of her campaign. This poll confirms her status as a co-frontrunner with Biden,\"\u00a0said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy. The poll found that Warren held narrow leads with both men and women\u00a0and that she had a 12-percentage-point lead with white voters. Biden was favored by black voters 36%-20% and by voters over 65 by a 41%-26% margin. The survey was conducted  Oct.\u00a04-7 from among 1,483 self-identified registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus\u00a03.1%. Warren also has performed well in the early primary states that can be key to securing the nomination. Last month, a\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found her leading in the\u00a0first-in-the-nation caucus state, and a Monmouth University poll put her narrowly ahead of Biden in New Hampshire.\u00a0A\u00a0 Suffolk\u00a0University/USA TODAY Network Poll released on Sept. 24 placed her just 4 points behind Biden in Nevada, the third state where primary voters will cast their ballots. Elizabeth Warren: Elizabeth Warren leads Iowa Poll for the first time, besting Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders Biden maintains a comfortable 41%-12% lead over Warren in South Carolina, the fourth state on the primary calendar, according to a recent Fox News poll. The former vice president's\u00a0drop in the polls comes as President Donald Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have mounted a public campaign accusing Biden of impropriety in Ukraine during his time in office. Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine to dig deeper into the matter has sparked an impeachment inquiry. Warren\u2019s latest hurdle to the presidency: Democrats' belief women face tougher fight against Trump Tuesday's poll from\u00a0Quinnipiac shows that voters approve of the impeachment inquiry 53%-43%\u00a0and that 45% think Trump should be removed from office while 49% do not. The margin had been 37%-57% in a Quinnipiac poll before the inquiry launched. Only 34% said they approved of the way Trump has responded to the impeachment inquiry, compared with 57% who disapproved. But 43% agreed with the president that it was a \"political witch hunt,\" while 51% said it was a \"legitimate investigation.\" Though Trump has said\u00a0his effort to push Ukraine to investigate Biden was motivated by a desire to battle corruption rather than taint a political opponent, only 33% of voters bought that explanation, and 48% said he was out to hurt a rival. Twenty percent weren't yet certain or thought both reasons were true. Polls have consistently found that Democratic voters care more about picking a candidate in 2020 who can defeat Trump than any particular policy issue. When asked whom they would vote for if the election was held today,\u00a0Quinnipiac found that both Warren and Biden would beat the incumbent president\u00a0\u2013 Biden by a margin of 51%-40% and Warren by a margin of 49%-41%. Trump indirectly acknowledged Warren's rise in the polls in a tweet Tuesday in which he called on his 2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton to \"enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.\" Speaking to House Republicans in Baltimore last month, Trump said\u00a0Warren had \"emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she can beat Sleepy Joe (Biden).\" \"He has no idea what\u2019s going on,\" Trump said.

Trump asked the Ukrainian government in a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0to investigate Biden and probe allegations about Ukraine's role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Democrats have cited evidence showing that the U.S. government withheld military aid from Ukraine as part of the effort to pressure Ukraine into opening the investigation. Trump has accused Biden's son of \"corruption\" relating to his board seat on a Ukrainian gas company, though Ukrainian prosecutors have said Hunter Biden did not do violate any laws. And on Oct. 3, Trump urged China to investigate Biden,\u00a0though the Chinese government has publicly declined to do so. In his speech today, Biden said there was \"no truth in [Trump's] charges against me and my son. Zero.\" Previously, Biden had hedged his comments about Trump despite the launching of an impeachment inquiry into Trump. \"If the president does not comply with such a request of\u00a0the Congress, if he continues to obstruct Congress, and flaunt the law,\" Biden had said on Sept. 24,\u00a0\"Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment.\" Shortly after Biden made his remarks, Trump tweeted in response and posted a campaign ad about Bide. \"So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong,\" Trump wrote. Biden later responded on Twitter. \"Thanks for watching. Stop stonewalling the Congress. Honor your oath. Respect the Constitution,\" Biden wrote, also calling on Trump to release his tax returns.

      "content": "    Twelve\u00a0Democratic presidential candidates sparred\u00a0Tuesday over healthcare, guns and other issues at a debate in Westerville, Ohio. Here's a play-by-play of the event: 11 p.m. EDT Welcome to the lead, Elizabeth Warren. Throughout a feisty three-hour Democratic debate in Ohio on Tuesday, the Massachusetts senator, who has risen to frontrunner status in recent polls, drew sharp and repeated attacks from other candidates on how to pay for health care, whether to tax the wealthy and what has caused the erosion of American middle class jobs. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea,\u201d Amy Klobuchar said at one point as she turned to Warren during an exchange over taxing billionaires. The sixth debate night of the 2020 presidential election cycle came during an inflection point in the race, as Joe Biden\u2019s longstanding status as the frontrunner has been battered by Warren\u2019s momentum. A common and telling refrain from the moderators throughout the debate: \u201cI want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond.\u201d The piling on began almost immediately, on the issue of health care. After five debates in which health care has been a top issue, the candidates drew sharper battle lines over how they would pay a Medicare-for-All system that has divided the field. Warren once again declined to say explicitly whether more government involvement in health care under Medicare for All would require Americans to pay more in taxes. \u201cSo let me be clear on this,\u201d Warren said. \u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down.\u201d Pete Buttigieg jumped, noting the lack of concrete response. \u201cWell, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,\u201d he said in response to Warren. \u201cLook, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.\u201d Bernie Sanders acknowledged that taxes would go up but said that families would save more than enough money in their health insurance plans to make up for it. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d Klobuchar said at one point. \u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d It was a frontrunner\u2019s debate, with Warren and Biden getting far more airtime than the other candidates on stage. The two had one of their first extended scuffles over a fundamental rift in the field: Whether the nominee should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering to a progressive wing that\u00a0wants major change, versus the more pragmatic approach favored by Biden and others on stage. President Donald Trump remained a central theme throughout the debate. Democrats were unified in their support of the impeachment inquiry launched this month by House Democrats. On the other hand, the flap over Joe Biden\u2019s son \u2013 Hunter Biden \u2013 and his business ties to Ukraine was addressed quickly in the debate and then dispensed with. Biden said his son \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d and that his interview on ABC earlier Tuesday \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d Other Democrats on stage did not seek to attack Biden over the issue. Quite the contrary, in fact. \u201cThat was so offensive,\" Cory Booker said of Biden having to answer a question on his son\u2019s foreign business. Another theme in the debate was criticism of Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, which\u00a0cleared\u00a0the way for Turkey to invade and battle with U.S.-allied Kurds. The Democratic candidates largely agreed that Trump\u2019s decision was a betrayal of the Kurds, but they disagreed on what to do next. Biden indicated that he would maintain a troop presence in the region. \u201cI would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being \u2013 having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they're not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds,\u201d Biden said. The debate about what to do in Syria drew in others into a clash on stage. \u201cSo really what you\u2019re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d Eight of the candidates on stage Tuesday had already qualified for the next debate \u2013 to be held Nov. 20 near Atlanta. That meant fewer of the lesser-known candidates this time around needed a breakout moment to stay alive. But the Iowa caucuses are fast approaching, and the window for moving from \u201cstaying alive\u201d to potentially clinching the nomination is narrowing. Four candidates who were on stage Tuesday aren\u2019t yet a lock for November: Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard, Julian Castro and Beto O\u2019Rourke. \u2013 John Fritze, Maureen Groppe, Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 10:47 p.m. EDT In one of the more tense moments in the debate, Joe Biden sparred with Elizabeth Warren over how to get things done in Washington. The back-and-forth came during a debate over whether Democrats should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering liberal elements of the party that want major structure change, versus Biden\u2019s more pragmatic approach and argument that the party should not overreach. To underscore her argument that Democrats should pursue bold ideas, Warren touted her role in setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 after the Great Recession and 2007-2009 financial crisis. The effort required a big fight. Republicans bitterly opposed the idea, viewing it as government overreach. \u201cI went on the floor and got you votes,\u201d a visibly upset Biden told Warren. \u201cI got you votes.\u201d Warren looked past Biden\u2019s remarks and instead thanked his former boss, President Barack Obama. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama for fighting so hard,\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou did a hell of job in your job,\u201d Biden acknowledged. \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren said. \u2013 John Fritze, Maureen Groppe, Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 10:40 p.m. EDT Democrats name check ... Robert Bork? The most unusual name check of Democratic debate night: The late conservative jurist Robert Bork. Cory Booker first invoked his name in mocking proposals to enforce antitrust law, saying that\u00a0\"Robert Bork is just laughing in his sleep.\" Numerous commentators pointed out an inconvenient fact. \"Bork has been dead for six years. He\u2019s more than asleep,\" tweeted political writer Walter Shapiro. (Bork actually died in December of 2012, almost seven years ago.) Political scientist Jack Pitney invoked the words of writer Raymond Chandler:\u00a0\u201cYou were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that, oil and water were the same as wind and air to you.\u201d Later in the debate, Joe Biden also jumped on the Bork bandwagon. Biden noted that, in 1987, he led the Senate effort to reject Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, a pivotal event in the hyper-partisanship that has marked so many judicial nominations. \u2013 David Jackson 10:29 p.m. EDT In the middle of his criticism of big corporations, Cory Booker playfully chided the moderators for asking older candidates \u2013 Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 about their health. \u201cI feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage,\u201d the New Jersey senator said. \u201cIt\u2019s rich to me that we asked three people about their health when, looking at this stage, we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.\u201d In February, after Trump took his annual physical exam, then White House press secrer Sarah Sanders said Trump is \u201cin very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond.\u201d A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019 physical health. \u2013 Ledyard King 10:15 p.m. EDT When pressed about whether he\u2019s \u201cup to the stress\u201d of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month, Sen. Bernie Sanders responded, \u201cI\u2019m healthy. I\u2019m feeling great.\u201d The 78-year-old canceled several campaign events after undergoing surgery, releasing a video in which he said lying in a Las Vegas hospital \u201cmade me feel even more strongly the need for us to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system.\u201d But as the Vermont senator seeks\u00a0to turn his heart attack into a conversation about Medicare for All,\u00a0the scare has renewed questions about whether his age will affect his stamina in the race and in the White House should he win in 2020. A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019 physical health. Sanders said he\u2019s reassuring Americans about his fitness by \u201cmounting a vigorous campaign\u201d across the country and he plugged a rally in Queens he is planning on Saturday. The Vermont senator also drew cheers after he thanked his supporters and those who sent prayers and well wishes for his recovery. The same question was put to another septuagenarian \u2013\u00a0Joe Biden, who would be 78 if elected to office. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience \u2013 with it comes wisdom,\u201d Biden said. 9:55 p.m. EDT Beto O\u2019Rourke and Pete Buttigieg got into an extended personal debate in a continuation of an argument they\u2019ve been having over O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal to require people to give up assault-style weapons. Asked how he would enforce a mandatory buyback program, O\u2019Rourke said he expects \u201cmy fellow Americans to follow the law.\u201d Buttigieg, who has called O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal a \u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support, said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s response makes clear that he doesn\u2019t know how the plan would work. \u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they\u2019re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups. Buttigieg said the problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cEveryone on this stage is determined to get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke then said Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cshiny object\u201d description of the buyback plan was a slap in the face to every survivor of a mass shooting. Buttigieg responded that the best response for gun shooting survivors is to \u201cactually deliver a solution.\u201d Amy Klobuchar echoed Buttigieg\u2019s criticism when asked what\u2019s wrong with a mandatory buyback program. \u201cI just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s not mess this up with this fight.\u201d Kamala Harris, when\u00a0asked why she supports a mandatory buyback program, replied by saying there are 5 million assault weapons are on the streets. \u201cI have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims that I care to tell you,\u201d the former prosecutor\u00a0said. \u201cI\u2019m done and we need action.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 9:46 p.m. EDT It\u2019s hard to make the argument on why voters should support you when you don\u2019t get much of a chance to talk. While Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg got most of the air time, Andrew Yang, Julian Castro, Cory Booker and new-to-the-stage Tom Steyer are having a harder time making their case. According to a word count of the first hour of the debate, candidates at the top of the poll led the scramble for air time Warren dominated speaking times for the first parts of the debate, based on a USA TODAY analysis of preliminary transcripts. She spoke about 1,251 words during the first two parts of the debate, followed by Biden, who spoke 668 words. Buttigieg had the third-most speaking time, at 658 words. On the other end, Beto O\u2019Rourke (190 words) Tulsi Gabbard (157 words), and businessman Tom Steyer had the least speaking time so far, with about 140 words. \u2013 Ledyard King and Nicholas Wu 9:42 p.m. EDT Elizabeth Warren used the debate to make a statement about the Middle East that is sure to get some attention in coming days as the Democrats clashed on stage over how to respond to the ongoing conflict in Syria. \"I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East,\" Warren said during a discussion of Turkey's invasion of northern Syria. \"I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.\" Commentators on social media clamored for Warren to be more specific. \"Warren is making big news when she says we should have no troops in the Middle East,\" tweeted Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton. \"We have important bases all over the region that are important to our national security.\u201d Warren\u2019s comments came during an extended debate how to proceed in the region. Democrats largely agree that President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria was an abandonment of U.S.-allied Kurds, but they disagreed somewhat on what to do next. \u201cSo really what you\u2019re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d Gabbard and Buttigieg are the only two Democrats on stage who served in uniform. \u2013 David Jackson and John Fritze 9:38 p.m. EDT Steyer: Trump\u2019s America First \u2018worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard\u2019 Tom Steyer, who has spent millions trying to combat climate change, made it clear how little he thinks of President Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d platform that champions the massive development and expansion of carbon-causing fossil fuels to power the U.S. economy. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve the climate crisis by ourselves,\u201d the one-time California hedge fund billionaire said. \u201cWe have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the word.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to lead the world morally,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to lead it technologically, financially and commercially. This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard, and I would change it one day one in every single way.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King 9:29 p.m. EDT Kamala Harris got in one of her signature lines on Donald Trump while criticizing his foreign policy. Harris said Trump has given 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card, calling what\u2019s happening in Syria a crisis of Trump\u2019s own making. And he has a long list of those, she added. \u201cThat\u2019s why Dude gotta go,\u201d Harris said. 9:27 p.m. EDT Joe Biden came out swinging on Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria but declined to answer a direct\u00a0question: Would he, as president, place special forces troops back in the region? Biden called Trump\u2019s decision the \u201cmost shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,\u201d as he excoriated the president for clearing the way for Turkey to attack U.S. allied Kurds in Syria. Biden said he believed the U.S. should be involved in air support, but declined to say whether he would order troops back. The issue is a complicated one for Democrats, many of whom have criticized Trump\u2019s move in Syria but who have also called for the U.S. to withdraw from entanglements in the Middle East. Trump has defended the move by saying he wants to extract American soldiers from overseas commitment. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg. \u2013 John Fritze and David Jackson 9:08 p.m. EDT In the first debates, Joe Biden who led the polls was the target of rivals\u2019 slings and arrows. On Tuesday, riding polls that show her now on top, Elizabeth Warren discovered that she\u2019s wearing the bullseye. On health care, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden took turns hitting Warren on her Medicare For All\u00a0plan that they said was costly and unrealistic. On wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her \u201dultra-millionaire tax\u201d as the best plan. \u201cWe just have different approaches,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke piled on: \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the solution but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up and sometimes I think Sen. Warren is focused on being punitive or pitting one side of the country against the other.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 9 p.m. EDT Democrats on stage largely agreed on at least one thing: Tax the rich. Even the rich agreed. Bernie Sanders took a question directly in his wheelhouse: Does he believe the billionaires should be taxed out of existence? Sanders didn\u2019t go that far, but he did say that the country could not \u201cafford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality.\u201d Tom Steyer, a philanthropist and longtime Democratic donor making his first appearance on the presidential debate stage, said he largely agreed with Sanders\u2019 assessment. \u201cSanders is right,\u201d Steyer said during an extended debate about whether the candidates supported a wealth tax. \u201cThere have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government.\u201d Amy Klobuchar captured the sense of the debate a minute later: \u201cNot even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d \u2013 John Fritze 8:53 p.m. EDT Bernie Sanders' support of the Green New deal and its guarantee of federal work for millions of Americans didn\u2019t sit well with businessman Andrew Yang, whose signature campaign proposal would give Americans\u00a0a $1,000 monthly \u201cdividend.\u201d Yang said he likes the \u201cspirit\u201d of a federal jobs guarantee, which Sanders said is needed with the onset of automation. But \u201cthe fact is most Americans don\u2019t want to work for the federal government,\u201d Yang said. \u201cAnd saying that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most American would embrace.\u201d Yang said he\u2019s rather put money directly in American\u2019s pocket\u00a0than rely on government to address the problem because \u201cit will result in failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King 8:51 p.m. EDT Senator Kamala Harris was asked to weigh in on the back-and-forth over Medicare for All and instead turned the conversation to abortion rights. \u201cThere are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare,\u201d she said. She said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color \u201cwill die\u201d because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being \u201cout of touch\u201d with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights. \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 8:37 p.m. EDT Elizabeth Warren, the candidate who boasts that she has a plan for everything, was pushed on why she hasn\u2019t said how she would pay for expanding health are to all Americans. Bernie Sanders, who like Warren supports Medicare for All,\u00a0has acknowledged that taxes would need to go up to pay for it, but has said premiums would go down. Asked whether her plan would require higher taxes on the middle class, Warren said costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations but down for middle class families. \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.\u201d Warren said. Buttigieg, who has criticized Warren on the issue, said she dodged the question \u2013 what he called an example of why people are \u201cso frustrated with Washington.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage for everyone is by obliterating private plans,\u201d Buttigieg said. Warren said Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d proposal is really \u201cMedicare for All Who Can Afford It.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the problem we\u2019ve got,\u201d she said. \u201cMedicare for All is the gold standard.\u201d Amy Klobuchar, another contender trying to distinguish herself by warning that the more liberal candidates are going too\u00a0far, said Warren was handing Republicans a gift by offering up a plan they can attack as too expensive.\u200b \u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice,\" Klobuchar said. \"The difference between a plan and a pipe dream, is something that you can actually get done,\" she said. Joe Biden argued that taxes increases for some would exceed what they would save on health care costs. \"The issues is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry,\u201d Sanders shot back. \u2013 Maureen Groppe and Courtney Subramanian 8:23 p.m. EDT Everyone knew the question was coming: Why was it okay for Hunter Biden to have a business interest in Ukraine when, as vice president, Joe Biden was the Obama administration\u2019s lead on that country? Biden largely demurred on the question. \u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment (Hunter) he made.\u201d The question had been guaranteed to come up early in this debate, the first since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry and the Trump campaign began firing back with television ads highlighting Hunter Biden\u2019s former business dealings in the Ukraine and China. Hunter Biden hours earlier acknowledged he made a \"mistake\" and showed \u201cpoor judgement\u201d in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. Speaking to ABC News, Hunter Biden denied doing anything \"improper\" in the Ukraine. Some Democrats saw the flap as a chance for Joe Biden to hit back at Trump, including by noting that Trump\u2019s children also have overseas business tied to Donald Trump\u2019s real estate empire. The former vice president didn't raise the issue. \u2013 John Fritze 8:20 p.m. EDT Steyer pushes his signature issue: impeachment Billionaire Tom Steyer, who launched his campaign in July, has long pushed for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment before the formal inquiry began and made that his first point in his debut on the Democratic debate stage tonight. Before calling every candidate on the stage more patriotic than the president, Steyer pointed out he launched the Need to Impeach, an online campaign focused on Trump\u2019s impeachment in October 2017, two years before House Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s interactions with Ukraine. \u201cImpeaching and removing the president is something the American people are demanding,\u201d he said. \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 8:17 p.m. EDT President Donald Trump has faced considerable blowback for his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria this month, a move that all but paved the way for Turkey to begin airstrikes against U.S.-allied Kurds. It didn\u2019t take long for that issue to pop up at the Democratic debate. Amy Klobuchar raised it in the answer to her first question, tying it to a question about whether the president should be impeached and removed from office. Klobuchar asked how \"leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter\" would make \"Make America Great Again.\" Look for this issue to come up a lot more over the next three hours. \u2013 John Fritze 8:11 p.m. EDT The debate launched with a question about House Democrat\u2019s impeachment inquiry, which all the Democratic presidential candidates support. But with a presidential election year coming up, why shouldn\u2019t voters determine whether Trump stays in office, Elizabeth Warren was asked. \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d she said. Up next, Bernie Sanders called Trump the most corrupt president in history. \u201cI agree with Bernie,\u201d Joe Biden echoed. Because the White House has refused to cooperate with Democrats\u2019 investigation, Biden added, Congress has no choice but to act. Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long. \u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 8 p.m. EDT The latest debate of the Democratic presidential primary is underway in Ohio. With the impeachment inquiry in full swing, fighting along the Syria-Turkey border, Bernie Sanders\u2019 recent health trouble and questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the Ukraine, the moderators of the three-hour CNN/New York Times debate will have plenty to ask about. Stay tuned here (and hit refresh often) for up-to-minute developments. \u2013 John Fritze 7:50 p.m. EDT Democrats will be on the debate stage Tuesday, but President Donald Trump's campaign is still looming large. The Trump campaign, campaign committees, and the Republican National Committee announced a $125.7 million fundraising haul for the third Federal Elections Commission filing quarter as Democrats prepared to take the stage for the fourth Democratic presidential debate. In a release, the campaign said all of the groups would have $158 million cash on hand. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s campaign is a juggernaut on an unstoppable path to victory in November 2020,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said. According to the Trump campaign, it received 1,056,126 individual donations last quarter, with an average donation of $44.50. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., raised about $25 million last quarter, the most out of any of the Democratic contenders. \u2013 Nicholas Wu 7:40 p.m. EDT Expect sharper elbows from South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has already\u00a0called out Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this week while trading barbs with former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke. The Indiana mayor launched a digital ad Monday explicitly attacking Sanders and Warren for their support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and instead touting his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d plan. Earlier this week, Buttigieg faced off with former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke over a mandatory buyback program for assault rifles, a policy O\u2019Rourke made headlines over in the last debate. Earlier this month O\u2019Rourke slammed Buttigieg for his hesitancy over support for the program. The mayor responded to the criticism earlier this week in an interview with Snapchat\u2019s \u201cGood Luck America.\u201d \u201cI get it. He needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant,\u201d Buttigieg said Monday. O\u2019Rourke responded in a tweet: \u201cPete can belittle the grassroots; he can call buybacks a \u2018shiny object.\u2019 He can say whatever he wants, but guns kill 40,000 people year.\u201d \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 7:15 p.m. EDT The dozen Democrats on the debate stage in Ohio will have to answer a boatload of uncomfortable questions Tuesday about health issues, the age of the field's frontrunners and foreign entanglements in the Ukraine \u2013 to name a few. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just threw another touchy issue into the queue: Should the House hold a vote to formalize the impeachment\u00a0Democrats announced at a press conference three weeks ago?\u00a0Less than two hours before the debate got underway, Pelosi announced that he House would hold off on that vote for now. Republicans have noted that every previous impeachment inquiry was preceded with a vote in the House to set up a special committee to conduct the investigation. Democrats say they don\u2019t need to do that \u2013 and the Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly require it \u2013 but Republicans have raised process questions to hammer away at the inquiry and the White House has said it won\u2019t provide documents absent a vote. \u2013 John Fritze 7:05 p.m. EDT President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016 by 8 points, rebranding a state long seen a presidential battleground into one that is older, whiter and more Republican. When\u00a0Trump won the state it raised questions about Ohio's ability to mirror the national mood, according to Kyle Kondik, author of \"The Bellwether.\" By holding their debate Otterbein University outside of Columbus, Democrats are signaling they\u2019re not conceding the state. \"I am absolutely confident that battleground Ohio will once again be in Democratic hands,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez told reporters from state and national news organizations. Democrats see hope in the suburbs, which have swung their way. That\u2019s why Tuesday night\u2019s debate will take place in an Ohio suburb that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 but switched to Hillary Clinton in 2016. The reason Ohio has become much more Republican relative to the nation? It's significantly whiter with a smaller share of college graduates than average.\u00a0That\u2019s not the case in Westerville, however, the town where the debate is being held. So unless Democrats can improve their standing with white voters without four-year college degrees, they'll have a hard time carrying Ohio in 2020, Kondik concludes in an analysis for the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. -- Cincinnati Enquirer, Maureen Groppe, Maureen\u00a0and John Fritze 7 p.m. EDT Is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg still considering a run for president? Based on an op-ed published hours before the debate Tuesday in the Washington Post, it sure looks like he\u2019s eager to remain in the mix. Bloomberg\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who initially announced he wouldn\u2019t run but who more recently has reportedly told allies he\u2019d consider it if Biden falters \u2013 writes that the current field of candidates is talking about the wrong things. \u201cRarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,\u201d said Bloomberg, who is known for overseeing a technocratic administration that came on the heels of another former New York leader who\u2019s been in the news a lot lately: Rudy Giuliani. \u201cThe job\u2019s essential skills primarily involve leadership and management, not policy analysis,\u201d Bloomberg writes. \u201cThe country elects a commander in chief, and yet based on the campaign so far, one might think we are electing a legislator in chief.\u201d Bloomberg also uses the piece to take a swipe at Trump. Bloomberg says he spoke with the president shortly after the 2016 election and advised him to hire people \u201cwho are smarter than you.\u201d So how did Trump do? A few good hires, Bloomberg opines, otherwise not very well. \u201cMostly he hired cronies, ideologues and sycophants,\u201d Bloomberg wrote, \u201cwhile also leaving hundreds of important senior level positions unfilled and paying less attention to many agencies than he does to cable TV news.\u201d \u2013 John Fritze 6:50 p.m. EDT Betting sites are taking all kinds of wagers on tonight\u2019s debate, including on whether Bernie Sanders will withdraw from the race, whether anyone will curse on stage, who will be tweeted about most, and how many times certain words will be said. Can you rank these words by the frequency in which SportsBetting.ag thinks they will be uttered? Billionaire. Impeach. China. Obama (as mentioned by Biden). If you guessed China, impeach, billionaire and then Biden references to Obama, you\u2019re thinking like a bookie. (The over/under on the China mentions is 40.5 and the over/under on Biden references to Obama is 3.5.) \u2013 Maureen Groppe 6:45 p.m. EDT A growing battle between Pete Buttigieg and the party\u2019s progressive wing escalated in the lead-up to the debate. Buttigieg released a new digital ad drawing a distinction between his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d health care plan and the proposal backed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The ad says Sanders and Warren \u201cbelieve that we have to force ourselves into `Medicare for all,\u2019 where private insurance is abolished.\u201d The ad is running in Iowa where a new poll from Firehouse Strategies has Buttigieg in third place, having moved ahead of Sanders. Buttigieg\u2019s increased attempts to go after the frontrunners include this comment he made Monday about Warren\u2019s eschewing small donor strategy: \u201cWe're not going to beat Trump with pocket change.\u201d In a tweeted response, Progressive icon Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the grassroots campaigning that Buttigieg \u201cinsults\u201d has outraised him. And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee boasted that \u201cnumerous progressive voices sent warning flares to Mayor Pete before Tuesday's debate.\u201d \u201cMayor Pete has been a rising star. But he needs to stop this,\u201d the political action committee wrote in a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday. 6:40 p.m. EDT The Trump campaign\u2019s response to the Democratic debate can be summed up in one word: socialism. In a full-page ad in today\u2019s Columbus Dispatch the campaign argues that Democrats\u2019 \u201cbig government socialism will wreck Ohio\u2019s economy.\u201d Banners scheduled to fly above the city of Westerville during the afternoon shouted \u201cSOCIALISM DESTROYS OHIO JOBS.\u201d The campaign says Democrats would raise taxes, eliminate private health insurance and increasing electrical bills by \u201cending fossil fuels.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 5:50 p.m. EDT The Westerville\u00a0debate is the first since\u00a0House\u00a0Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump last month over the Ukraine scandal. Joe Biden will have a chance to push back forcefully on the president's efforts to get officials in Ukraine to investigate him and his son, Hunter. But Biden also may face\u00a0questions about the appropriateness of his son's having served on \u00a0the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0will take the stage\u00a0two weeks after having a heart attack. And Elizabeth Warren has been making a strong case\u00a0\u2013\u00a0through fundraising, organizing and poll numbers\u00a0\u2013 for why she should be considered the frontrunner. Still, Biden will stand in the center of the stage, flanked by Warren and Sanders, based on the average of the 10 most recent qualifying polls as of Oct. 2. October Democratic debate: Will Sanders attend? What are the issues? Here are 4 things you need to know The nine other candidates on stage will make the debate the largest presidential primary debate in the nation's recorded history, according to the New York Times. They will have three hours, in snippets of 75 seconds or less, to make their case to the voters. \u2013 Maureen Groppe On stage for the first time will be billionaire Tom Steyer who has pumped millions of dollars into a campaign to impeach Trump. A half dozen Democrats still in the race didn't make tonight's cut, including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, the only remaining governor running, and self-help author Marianne Williamson. The polling numbers and fundraising support required to participate will ratchet up further for the November debate. Impeachment: 5 ways the Trump impeachment inquiry will loom large at Tuesday's Democratic debate \u2013 Maureen Groppe Joe Biden told supporters at a California fundraiser last week that he's had a target on his back at the debates because he began\u00a0the race as a frontrunner. He's facing competition for his frontrunner status, though. Elizabeth Warren has been climbing in the polls. In some surveys, she polls slightly higher than him while in others Biden maintains an edge. Biden also enters the debate facing questions about how well he's handled the Ukrainian controversy and having just been outraised by three of his opponents in the last quarter. Plus, in an interview that aired Tuesday morning, Hunter Biden\u00a0repeatedly admitted\u00a0he made a \"mistake\" in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. So should we expect a different Biden from the last three rounds? \u201cOne of the problems I\u2019m finding, I\u2019ve got to be more aggressive,\u201d Biden said at the fundraiser.\u00a0\u201cWhich is good, I\u2019m not complaining, I\u2019m a big boy,\u201d he said, while explaining that the debates' time restraints don\u2019t allow time for full answers. \u2013 Maureen Groppe While debates offer a chance for contenders to stand out by attacking an opponent, that can be difficult to do while remaining likable. And a poll out Tuesday underscores why Democrats need to stay in good graces with voters. The latest findings from the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Battleground Poll show Trump isn\u2019t the only one who has a higher unfavorability than favorability rating. For six of the seven Democratic hopefuls tested, more voters had a negative opinion than a positive one. The exception was Pete Buttigieg, but 39% of respondents had no opinion of him or had never heard of him. \u2013 Maureen Groppe Contributing: Nicholas Wu",

      "author": "Stephen Gruber-Miller",
      "content": " Altoona, IOWA \u2014 Former Vice President Joe Biden said if he is elected president, no one in his family will hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government. \"No one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they are a cabinet member, will, in fact, have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country. Period. Period. End of story,\" Biden told reporters in Iowa after giving remarks at a labor conference. Biden's remarks to reporters at the United Food and Commercial Workers 2020 presidential forum in Altoona, Iowa, on Sunday came hours after his son, Hunter, announced he would step down from the board of a Chinese private equity firm and committed to not do any foreign work if his father is elected president. Biden said his son's lawyers had told him they would be issuing a statement but he did not consult with his son about the statement and only saw it when it was released publicly Sunday morning. Biden said no one has asserted he or his son have done anything wrong, except President Donald Trump. Hunter Biden: Will resign from board of Chinese firm, says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president The younger Biden has become a target of Trump\u2019s criticism for his work on the boards of companies in Ukraine and China, although there is no evidence that he engaged in unlawful behavior. Trump\u2019s request of the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in that country has become the basis for an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House. Democrats allege the request amounted to using the power of the presidency to improperly ask a foreign power to investigate the family of one of his domestic political rivals. Trump has said he did not do anything wrong. Biden said no news organizations that have investigated his son's business dealings have found that there was any wrongdoing by the Bidens. \"No one, no one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong. No one has asserted that I have done anything wrong, except a lying president,\" Biden told reporters. 'Whatever happened to\u00a0Hunter?': Donald Trump steps up attacks on Joe Biden and his son at Minneapolis rally Biden's appearance at the labor forum was his first visit to Iowa since calling for Trump to be impeached last week. Biden is one of the last Democratic presidential contenders to signal his support for the U.S. House's impeachment inquiry against Trump. Failing to pursue the impeachment inquiry against the president could give future presidents license to engage in unethical behavior, Biden said at the forum. \"If, in fact, the House doesn\u2019t move and let the facts fall where they may, what does the next unethical president, if we elect another one, what does that say they can do?\" Biden said. \"What\u2019s that say?

Several public polls in recent days have found that public support for an impeachment inquiry tops 50%. \"What\u2019s going to change Republican minds in the United States Congress is when their constituents start changing their minds,\" Biden told the labor forum. \"And you\u2019re seeing it start to happen: More Republican voters, independent voters are saying, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa.

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013\u00a0As 12 of the remaining 19 Democratic presidential candidates head\u00a0into Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday for the fourth primary debate,\u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden and\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are at the front of the pack, according to polls. Who's leading between Biden and Warren? It depends on which polling outfit you ask. Biden leads Warren 32%-21% in the latest update from Politico-Morning Consult and 32%-22% in a poll released last week by Fox News.\u00a0 Warren leads by 3 percentage points in a Quinnipiac University poll published\u00a0Monday and by 4 points in an Economist-YouGov poll published last week. Until recently, Biden had led in virtually every major poll published since the\u00a0end of 2018, but\u00a0Warren has come out on top in eight\u00a0of the past 15 national polls. Monday's poll is the third survey\u00a0in a row from Quinnipiac in which Warren finished ahead of Biden. \"For Sen.\u00a0Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,\" Quinnipiac polling analyst Tim Malloy said. \"Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.\" October Democratic debate: Will Sanders attend? What are the issues? Here are 4 things you need to know Voters have the highest\u00a0expectations for Warren\u00a0heading into Tuesday's debate:\u00a029% of Democrats and those who lean Democrat\u00a0say\u00a0they think she will perform the best, 25% say\u00a0Biden and 13% say\u00a0Bernie Sanders, according to a Politico-Morning Consult poll conducted from Oct. 11-13. Fifty-eight percent of those voters say they are motivated to watch the debate, and 27% say\u00a0they are not motivated. Among all registered voters, 49% say\u00a0they are motivated to watch, and\u00a046% say\u00a0they aren't. Fifty-eight percent of registered voters say the debate is at least \"somewhat important,\" and\u00a033% say\u00a0it is \"not very important\" or \"not important at all.\" Among Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters, 71% say it is important, and 12% say\u00a0it is not. Last month, Warren began to pull ahead of Vermont Sen. Sanders, who\u00a0has come up third in most recent polls. More: Tulsi Gabbard says she will attend Tuesday Dem debate after considering a protest Since July, Warren and\u00a0Sanders had been locked in a virtual tie for second place in a majority of polls. The two have been the favorites of liberal voters in contrast with Biden who is the choice of more moderate Democrats. As Warren\u00a0surged to compete with Biden for the top spot, Sanders\u00a0\u2013 who suffered a heart attack\u00a0this month\u00a0\u2013 faded, finishing third in all but four of 22 polls conducted since mid-September. Warren is the choice of 50% of Democratic voters\u00a0and independents who lean Democratic\u00a0who identify as \"very liberal\"\u00a0in the poll from Quinnipiac. Sanders and Biden are tied at 14% within that group. Among those who call themselves \"somewhat liberal,\" Warren finishes\u00a0first at 34%, Sanders comes in at 17% and Biden at 15%. Biden is\u00a0the clear favorite among those who identify\u00a0as conservative Democrats at 36%;\u00a0Warren comes in  second at 19%, and Sanders is third at 6%.

But Democratic voters indicate\u00a0defeating President Donald Trump in the general election is their top priority, and about half of Democratic voters see Biden as the candidate best equipped to pull that off. Forty-eight percent say Biden has\u00a0the best chance of defeating Trump, and 21% see\u00a0Warren as the candidate with the best shot. While Biden has hovered at 42% to\u00a056% in Quinnipiac polls on this question, Warren had never finished higher than 9% in previous surveys from the pollster. More: Elizabeth Warren leads\u00a0Joe Biden in Democratic presidential primary polls When asked which Democratic candidate they think would be the best leader, 32% say\u00a0Biden and 28% say\u00a0Warren. On the question of impeachment, 46% say\u00a0Trump should be removed from office, and\u00a048% oppose\u00a0such a move. A\u00a0narrow majority of 51% approve\u00a0of the Democrat-controlled House's move to open an impeachment inquiry, and 59% say\u00a0they disapprove\u00a0of the way Trump has responded to the inquiry. Fifty-one percent say the impeachment is a \"legitimate\" investigation, and\u00a043% say\u00a0it is a \"political witch hunt.\" Though 66% say it is \"not acceptable\" for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival, as Trump encouraged\u00a0Ukraine to look at\u00a0Biden, only 44% say\u00a0that is a good enough reason to remove a president from office. The Quinnipiac poll was conducted Oct. 11-13 among 1,195 registered voters. It has\u00a0a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%.

Biden, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, used a speech in Iowa to criticize several aspects of Trump's foreign policy, including the trade war with China and\u00a0his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Trump is \"a complete failure\" and \"the most reckless and incompetent commander-in-chief we've ever had,\" Biden said. 2020 Election: 5 things we learned from the Democratic debate in Ohio But he saved his harshest words for Trump's decision earlier this month to remove U.S. armed forces from northern Syria. Turkey subsequently invaded the country, including territory held by the Kurds, who were U.S. allies in the fight against ISIS. \"The events of this past week in Syria have brought devastating clarity to just how dangerous he is to our national security, to our leadership around the world, and to the lives of our brave men and women serving in uniform,\" Biden said, according to prepared remarks. The decision to withdraw troops from Syria, Biden said, created a humanitarian crisis and gave ISIS \"a new lease on life by forcing the Kurds to defend themselves against Turkey instead of fighting ISIS remnants.\" \"These brave Kurdish and Arab forces paid a steep price, with over 10,000 making the ultimate sacrifice,\" Biden said, according to the prepared remarks. \"And then, Trump sold them out.\" Trump has stood by his decision. \"It's not our problem,\" the president\u00a0told reporters Wednesday\u00a0as Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prepared to travel to\u00a0Turkey to try to negotiate a ceasefire\u00a0and avoid a humanitarian crisis on the Syrian border. \"Imagine how demoralizing this must be for our troops: Russian mercenaries taking victory laps inside the bases that President Trump ordered them to abandon. Turkey attacking the very people they fought alongside,\" Biden said. Biden also used the speech to highlight the Obama administration's efforts against ISIS. \"The Obama-Biden administration worked with and alongside partners in Syria with just a few hundred Americans supporting tens of thousands of local fighters to take the fight to ISIS on the ground,\" Biden said. \"Our strategy was so successful, it turned out that Trump\u2019s secret plan to defeat ISIS was to just keep doing what we were doing \u2014 until last week.\" Trump has faced bipartisan criticism for the withdrawal of troops, with the U.S. House voting overwhelmingly\u00a0Wednesday afternoon to condemn the move. \"Even Republicans in Congress know this is irresponsible,\" Biden said. \"It's about the only time they've mustered the backbone to publicly criticize Trump.\"",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden dodged some of the piling on from other 2020 candidates he has seen in previous Democratic debates, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren took on a lot of that heat on Tuesday. Biden thinks that's a good thing, but questioned Warren's standing as a frontrunner in comments to reporters in Ohio on Wednesday. \"Well, it's kind of about time other people get questioned,\" he said. \"You know, I haven't seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a frontrunner. You guys keep talking about that.\" \"I think Elizabeth Warren's done very well,\" Biden added. \"She's moved, but now that she has moved and is taken more seriously, people are going to ask her about a little candor here. Tell us how you're going to do what you say you're going to do\" More: Elizabeth Warren is a new front-runner in town. Just ask her Democratic rivals The Massachusetts senator has led\u00a0Biden by a slim margin in several national polls and in some\u00a0early voting states like Iowa. While Biden had a significant lead on both Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earlier this year, data shows Warren steadily closing that gap. Warren faced attacks at the debate from South Bend, Indiana,\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who both pressed her on issues such as her Medicare for All plan. Warren has repeatedly skirted a direct answer when asked if her plan will require tax increases on the middle class, something Biden has criticized her for heavily. But she maintains that overall costs will go down. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential thing in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board,\" Biden said Wednesday. At the debate, tensions flared between Biden, whose vision for the Democratic Party includes an approach akin to the Obama-Biden administration, and Warren, who is an icon for some in the more progressive wing in the party. When Warren discussed her work on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama era, Biden jumped in, saying he had rounded up votes in the Senate for it. \"Let's get that straight,\" he said. Warren responded after a pause, \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\" Biden later cut her off, \"You did a hell of a job in your job.\" \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren deadpanned.",
