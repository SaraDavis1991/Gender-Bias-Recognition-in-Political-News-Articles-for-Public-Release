      "content": " Clarification: A quote texted to USA TODAY about Bernie Sanders pulling out of the town hall was misattributed to the campaign. The story has been updated to remove the erroneous quote. WASHINGTON \u2014 After suffering a heart attack last week, Vermont senator and 2020 Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders will no longer be participating in a televised\u00a0LGBTQ\u00a0town hall on Thursday, according to CNN. The 2020 presidential hopeful felt chest discomfort during a campaign event in Las Vegas last week and had a blockage in one artery. Two stents were\u00a0inserted, his campaign said last week, and he\u00a0was released from Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center on Friday. His doctors said Sanders\u2019 \u201chospital course was uneventful with good expected progress.\u201d Sanders, 78, was seen walking about his neighborhood in Burlington, Vermont, with his wife, Jane, Monday, and told reporters he'd be back on the campaign trail \"soon.\"\u00a0He said on Sunday\u00a0that he was \u201cglad to be home in Burlington to rest for a little bit\u201d and is \u201crecovering well and feeling much better.\u201d Sanders will participate in the upcoming Democratic primary debate,\u00a0his campaign\u00a0confirmed to USA TODAY last week. But he has cancelled some other campaign events since his heart attack. CNN and LGBTQ advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign announced at the end of CNN's 7-hour forum\u00a0on climate change that they would be partnering to host the Thursday town hall. The event\u00a0focused on LGBT issues comes after Trump administration policies that have\u00a0banned\u00a0transgender Americans from serving in the military,\u00a0prohibited\u00a0embassies from flying rainbow flags during Pride Month and\u00a0rolled\u00a0back\u00a0certain Obama-era nondiscrimination protections. Sanders, an independent\u00a0who ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016, has been consistently among the top three Democratic contenders in the large field. He currently stands in third place in national polling, according to a Real Clear Politics' averaging of major polls. The Vermont senator\u2019s health scare has brought age to the forefront of the 2020 race. Sanders is the oldest person running for President. The other top democratic contenders\u00a0are also the oldest.\u00a0Former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0follows Sanders at 76, and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is 70. President Donald Trump is also\u00a073 years old. Contributing: Jeanine Santucci and Aamer Madhani.",

      "content": " Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders had a heart procedure\u00a0after suffering chest discomfort during a campaign event Tuesday evening in Las Vegas, a top campaign aide confirmed Wednesday. \u201cFollowing medical evaluation and testing, he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted. Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits,\u201d senior campaign adviser Jeff Weaver said. \"He will be resting up over the next few days. We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.\u201d Sanders, 78, later wrote on Twitter that he was \"feeling good\" and that his medical episode underscored the need for Medicare for All, his signature policy proposal that would lead to a massive expansion of the government\u00a0backed health-care system while doing away with private insurance. \"I'm fortunate to have good health care and great doctors and nurses helping me to recover,\" Sanders added. \"None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!\" The Vermont senator is among the top contenders vying for the 2020 Democratic nomination. He trails former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the polls. Sanders has kept a breakneck campaign schedule since entering the race in February\u00a0and has been a prolific fundraiser. He announced this week that he had collected $25.3 million from small donors \u2013 the largest quarter for any Democratic candidate this year. The Democratic socialist has boasted that most of his campaign war chest\u00a0comes from small donors. The heart problem led to the postponement of a $1.3\u00a0million television advertising buy in Iowa this week, said the campaign's Midwest spokesman, Bill Neidhardt. Sanders had been scheduled to take part in a gun safety forum in Las Vegas on Wednesday and campaign in California in the coming days. President Donald Trump's reelection campaign and Sanders' Democratic presidential rivals took to social media to wish the Vermont senator a speedy recovery. Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communication\u00a0director, said his team sent\u00a0Sanders \"our prayers and wish him a speedy recovery.\" Biden tweeted: \"Anyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is. We are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon.\" Warren said, \"Bruce, Team Warren, and I are sending all our best wishes for a speedy recovery to@BernieSanders. I hope to see my friend back on the campaign trail very soon.\" \"Thinking of @BernieSanders\u00a0today and wishing him a speedy recovery,\" Sen. Kamala Harris, another 2020 Democratic contender,\u00a0tweeted. \"If there's one thing I know about him, he's a fighter and I look forward to seeing him on the campaign trail soon.\" The Vermont senator is one of four septuagenarians battling for the White House in 2020. Does age matter?\u00a0Trump vs. Biden in Iowa: Septuagenarian rivals try to demonstrate vigor in head-to-head stops Trump is 73,\u00a0Biden is 76\u00a0and Warren is 70. The age of the contenders has been mostly a backburner issue\u00a0in the campaign. Forty-six percent of voters planning to attend Iowa\u2019s Democratic caucuses said it would be a disadvantage for a candidate to be older than 70, and 50% said\u00a0it would make no difference,\u00a0according to a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll\u00a0published in June. Three percent said they were unsure, and 1% said it would be\u00a0an advantage. The stent procedure comes at a moment when Sanders \u2013 despite maintaining a strong fundraising haul \u2013 had found his candidacy in a \u201cslow-moving decline\u201d as fellow progressive candidate Warren has moved up in the polls, said Daniel Schlozman, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University. In his unsuccessful 2016 run for the Democratic nomination, Sanders found success in his head-to-head competition consolidating a range of opposition among Democratic primary voters to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and those on the left who questioned the centrist trajectory of the party. But in a crowded field \u2013 there are still 19 major Democratic candidates vying for the nomination \u2013 Sanders has had more difficulty making headway with voters. He stands in third place in\u00a0national polling, according to a Real Clear Politics' averaging of major polls. Sanders also sits in third place in polling of three of the first four caucus and primary states. \u201cAs of yesterday, Sanders faced strategic challenges in a multi-candidate race, where he faced a closely (ideologically) aligned and fast-rising candidate in Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Schlozman said. \u201cThose challenges haven\u2019t disappeared, and now there is a new concern on top of them. \"How he thinks his way through the issues of age and health is another difficult issue for a campaign that was already facing a ceiling as far as we could see unless something pretty substantial happened to shake the field out.\u201d Contributing: Nick Coltrain in Des Moines",

      "author": "Joel Shannon",
      "content": " When a software engineer employed by Facebook\u00a0asked billionaire Mark Zuckerberg to comment on Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders' position that billionaires should not exist, fellow employees began to laugh. Facebook CEO and co-founder Zuckerberg also chuckled after a moment's pause. Those in attendance at Thursday's\u00a0live-streamed town hall-style internal meeting\u00a0began supportively to applaud. \"It's a good question ... All right,\" Zuckerberg said. In the answer that followed, Zuckerberg \u2013 who,\u00a0with a net worth of $67 billion,\u00a0is listed by Forbes as the fourth wealthiest American\u00a0\u2013 said he was sympathetic to Sanders' views on income inequality. \"I understand where he's coming from,\" he said, noting he couldn't put a threshold on how much wealth is too much. \"At some level, no one deserves to have that much money.\" He went on to say he sees potential advantages to some\u00a0Americans' ability to accumulate even \"unreasonable\" amounts of wealth, too. Forbes 400: Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett remain the richest people in the US Facebook encryption: Here's why the government doesn't want Facebook to encrypt your messages He cited his own philanthropic pledges as an example:\u00a0Zuckerberg and wife Dr. Priscilla Chan have pledged to give away 99% of their Facebook shares in their lifetime. Zuckerberg said that while critics might argue billionaires' charitable gifts would benefit the nation more as tax dollars,\u00a0he says his philanthropy is funding scientific research projects that would likely be ignored by the government. \"I think the alternative would be the government chooses all of the funding for all of the stuff,\" he commented. \"Part of what makes progress happen is people taking different approaches to different things,\" he went on to say. The exchange happened at a weekly\u00a0\"internal Q&A\" that was publicly\u00a0live-streamed on\u00a0Zuckerberg's Facebook page. Usually the sessions are only for employees but a\u00a0previous Q&A session made headlines this week when Zuckerberg was heard saying in leaked audio\u00a0that he would\u00a0\"go to the mat\" to fight efforts aimed at breaking up the social networking giant. That sparked a response from another Democratic presidential hopeful: Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, who defended her plan to break up big tech companies. Zuckerberg was asked Thursday about Warren's plans and responded: \"Let's try not to antagonize her further.\" On Friday, Warren tweeted a video clip of the question and the start of Zuckerberg's response. \"If Facebook finds my scrutiny uncomfortable, here's what Mark Zuckerberg and his team could work on,\" Warren tweeted, listing\u00a0protecting consumers' privacy, ensuring Facebook \"isn\u2019t undermining our election security\" and ending \"his company's illegal anticompetitive practices.\" Contributing: Kelly Tyko, Jessica Guynn,\u00a0Brett Molina",

      "author": "Nick Coltrain",
      "content": " DES MOINES \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders canceled several planned Iowa events to recover from a heart attack, but\u00a0his Iowa campaign staff are\u00a0moving forward\u00a0with or without him on the stump. Sanders, who was hospitalized the night of Oct. 1 to have two stents inserted to clear blockages in his heart, has no current plans to return to Iowa. His only public event scheduled now is Tuesday's televised debate in Ohio. Tuesday evening,\u00a0he\u00a0told reporters\u00a0assembled outside of his home in Burlington, Vermont, that he's going to \"change the nature of the campaign a bit, and make sure I have the strength to do what I need to do.\" The Democratic presidential candidate told\u00a0NBC News on Wednesday he plans to \"get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\" albeit one where \"I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.\" What that means for Sanders' Iowa campaign strategy wasn't immediately clear. Sanders\u00a0canceled one Iowa swing immediately after he was hospitalized\u00a0and a second appearance at an Iowa labor forum,\u00a0planned for Oct. 13. Sanders is slated to participate in a Des Moines forum on issues important to Latino voters on Oct. 24, but his\u00a0campaign staff couldn't confirm if that would happen. Before his heart attack, when Sanders would campaign\u00a0through Iowa, he'd pack his schedule with town halls, forums and rallies. At the end of September, his most recent visit, he held\u00a011 public events over four days, starting in Des Moines before moving from north-central Iowa down to its southeast corner. During those four days, he also\u00a0included two events in Oklahoma. The heart attack\u00a0led the campaign to delay a $1.3 million ad buy on Iowa TV markets. The two-week buy launched Tuesday, four days after it initially planned to air,\u00a0campaign spokesperson Bill Neidhardt said. The Iowa campaign hasn't stopped, however.\u00a0In early October, the campaign's national co-chair, U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna of California, traveled across Iowa\u00a0as volunteers canvassed neighborhoods and worked phonebanks. \"We began this campaign with the intent to win Iowa, and we continue to intend to win Iowa,\" Neidhardt said. Iowa tends to see fewer presidential candidates in the days\u00a0leading up to televised Democratic debates, so Sanders' absence does not stand out as much as it would during other stretches. The Des Moines Register's candidate event tracker showed a bare schedule\u00a0wrapping up October among all candidates. Sanders, so far, has held the most public events in Iowa among\u00a0the top-polling candidates. Among candidates with more than 1% support in the latest\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, only U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has held 85 events, has had more Iowa stops than Sanders. Sanders has held 76 Iowa events this cycle. But campaigns tend to come to Iowa more frequently in the fall and winter leading up to the February caucuses.\u00a0U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris in particular has said she plans to focus on the first-in-the-nation nominating contest to prove her mettle as a candidate. She was in Iowa the first weekend of October and will be back next weekend. Sam Roecker, a Democratic strategist and consultant, said Sanders' absence from the campaign trail likely won't hurt him as much as it would a lesser-known candidate. But Sanders will need to keep his name in the national conversation and pivot focus\u00a0away from concerns of his health and fitness for the job. \"It's up in the air,\" Roecker said.\u00a0\"We're still at that point where people haven't made up their mind on who they're going to caucus for.\" But Sanders' health scare has not dissuaded his most fervent supporters. Alyssa Rooney, a 25-year-old social worker in Waterloo, has supported Sanders since the 2016 race. She points to his demanding schedule, routine of walks and basketball, and general vigor during campaign stops as evidence of overall physical fitness. \"People have health issues all the time,\" Rooney said in an interview.\u00a0\"Young people have health issues. For me, I read that he had this health scare but he was OK. For me, that was the end of it. It happened, but he can move on from it. \"I still believe he's the best person for the job.\"",

Bernie Sanders for president came as he took the stage alongside his 2020 rivals and showed he was still in the game after a health scare. But Sanders got the news from the New York representative herself as he was still recovering in the hospital from a heart attack earlier this month, according to a new report. Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, told\u00a0Politico\u00a0he answered the phone that day and passed it over to Sanders, who was in his hospital bed. \"Think about the courage of this person who says, \u2018You know, I know what you just went through but I have so much trust and confidence in you that you are the one who will fight the fight that I believe in. I'm with you,' \" Shakir said. Minnesota's Ilhan Omar, another freshman Democrat in Congress who announced her support of Sanders Tuesday night, also told the senator about her decision after his heart attack, according to Politico. Sanders\u00a0said during Tuesday's debate that a \"special guest\" would be joining him at a rally this weekend, and it was later confirmed the guest would be Ocasio-Cortez and that she would make her endorsement then. In response to a question about his heart attack and recovery at the debate, the 78-year-old\u00a0said, \"I\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great.\" Sanders had canceled several campaign events after his surgery. He released a video\u00a0in which he said being in a Las Vegas hospital \u201cmade me feel even more strongly the need for us to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system.\u201d 'I'm feeling great': Bernie Sanders reassured voters of his health following heart attack He also said in an NBC interview, \"We're going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings.\u201d Sanders is currently trailing former Vice President Joe Biden, 76, and Massachusetts Sen.

      "content": "All 12\u00a0leading Democratic candidates for president got a chance to demonstrate why they were able to meet the requirements to pack on the stage for the fourth debate Tuesday. Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts stayed feisty and focused in her new role as front-runner. Former Vice President Joe Biden was optimistic and self-congratulatory as he tried to win the John McCain name-dropping contest. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii confounded everyone by spreading the blame for the slaughter of the Kurds in northern Syria that Donald Trump invited to members of \u201cboth parties.\u201d And Andrew Yang got to say lots of things as if no one had ever thought of them before. But the winner of the night was older than the two youngest candidates on stage \u2014 Gabbard, 38, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 37 \u2014 combined. Vermont Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders, 78, returned to the campaign trail after recovering from a heart attack to deliver his strongest debate performance of the campaign. He was lively, funny and persuasive. At one\u00a0point, he even seemed to convince billionaire Tom Steyer that billionaires shouldn\u2019t exist. Sanders also took on Biden\u2019s constant praise of bipartisanship and his pointed boast, \u201cI'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done.\u201d \u201cJoe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut you know what you also got done \u2014 and I say this as a good friend \u2014 you got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements like NAFTA and PNTR (permanent normal trade relations)\u00a0with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs. Now, let's get to 'Medicare for All.' ... If we stood together, we could create the greatest health care system in the world.\u201d A conservative's take: Winners and losers in the Democratic debate from columnist Glenn Harlan Reynolds But Bernie\u2019s biggest moment of the night didn\u2019t happen onstage. In the closing minutes of the debate, news broke that one of the brightest young stars on America\u2019s left, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York,\u00a0will endorse the 2016 Democratic primary runner-up this weekend. This gives the democratic socialist from Vermont the chance to break the momentum of Warren\u2019s steady rise in the polls, though he notably hasn\u2019t taken a shot at the senator from Massachusetts on the debate stage yet. Instead, he sided with her several times as she was cornered, echoing her arguments for systemic change. The format of the debate flowed much better than the previous three. It\u2019s unclear whether\u00a0this\u00a0was because the moderators allowed the candidates more air to answer and rebut each other, or because self-help guru Marianne Williamson wasn\u2019t on the stage. Whatever it is, they should do more of it. While there are still miles to go before anyone actually votes for a nominee, the race for the chance to oppose Trump will likely remain a tossup among\u00a0Sanders, Warren and Biden. This is mostly because the rest of the candidates have done a better job of canceling each other out than breaking through. While the debates have led to some blips in the polls \u2014 most notably for Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris of California after the second debate \u2014 the crowded stage format has the effect of blurring candidates together, especially since every debate seems to rehash the same Medicare for All contentions over and over until even Sanders seems a little bored by the fray. Another huge winner of the night was impeachment, which is now polling\u00a050%. Every candidate on stage backs the inquiry in the House, and no candidate showed any willingness to echo the attacks on Hunter Biden that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into trumping up. Unfortunately, the biggest loser of the night was human civilization. While there was a question about Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 defense of her kindness to former president and torture purveyor George W. Bush, there wasn\u2019t one question about climate change. Future generations will have to be satisfied\u00a0knowing that we were much too busy worrying about rich people getting along in luxury boxes to stop the planet from boiling.

But as the Vermont senator seeks\u00a0to turn his heart attack into a conversation about Medicare for All,\u00a0the scare has renewed questions about whether his age will affect his stamina in the race and in the White House should he win in 2020. A\u00a0Huffpo/YouGov poll\u00a0released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019s physical health.

Sanders said during his speech that he planned to campaign with Ocasio-Cortez, ensuring that Ocasio-Cortez will continue to have a high-profile role in the presidential campaign. President Donald Trump has frequently criticized her, and retweeted a post from the Republican Party Twitter this afternoon that criticized Ocasio-Cortez and Rep.

A person with knowledge of the plans confirmed the endorsement. The Washington Post had first reported the planned endorsement. Nina Turner, a former state senator and current\u00a0Sanders campaign national co-chair, said to The USA TODAY Network that Ocasio-Cortez was returning the favor for the groundwork Sanders' campaign had laid in 2016. \"So the foundation that he laid in 2016 allowed for candidates to stand up and be bold and run their race,\" Turner said.\u00a0\"This is coming full circle. One person doesn't make or break a campaign, but the level of excitement, it's going to take it to the next level for us.\" Later in the evening, Rep. Ilhan Omar, another member of the group of progressive House freshmen colloquially known as \"the Squad\" announced her endorsement of Sanders. Omar cited Sanders' leadership of a \"working class movement to defeat Donald Trump,\" and his leadership on other major progressive issues \u2013 \"And it\u2019s why I believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020,\" she said in a release. Sanders had promoted the rally, which will take place in Queens, New York, during the debate, along with the promise of a \"special guest.\" Ocasio-Cortez's district includes part of Queens, though the rally would take place right outside her district.\u00a0The two also interacted on Twitter during the debate. \"Tax the rich,\" she tweeted, during a debate over income inequality. The Sanders campaign then quoted her tweet with the comment, \"When we are in the White House, that is exactly what we will do.\" The New York congresswoman and liberal firebrand was an organizer for Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign when the senator's insurgent campaign in the Democratic primary caught fire against establishment pick Hillary Clinton. The endorsement by the outspoken progressive could help the Sanders campaign, which has recently lagged in polls amid the rise of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and questions about Sanders' health after he had a heart attack. Contributing: Ledyard King, USA TODAY; Jessie Balmert, Cincinnati Enquirer",
