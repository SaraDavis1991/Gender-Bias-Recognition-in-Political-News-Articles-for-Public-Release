      "content": "   WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 As some Democratic presidential candidates are pushing\u00a0back on blistering criticism from President Donald Trump that their party has become \"socialist,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday doubled down on his embrace of the label. Touting his \"democratic socialism\" approach to politics\u00a0as the best way to address income inequality, the U.S. senator from Vermont sought to rebrand the controversial term during a high-profile address\u00a0\u2013 even as some within his party worry that a leftward lurch could hurt Democrats in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin next year. \"Over 80 years ago, Franklin Delano Roosevelt helped create a government that made transformative progress in protecting the needs of working families,\" Sanders said. \"Today, in the second decade of the 21st century, we must take up the unfinished business of the New Deal and carry it to completion.\" Trump has labeled the entire Democratic field socialist and has repeatedly warned that\u00a0a Democratic president would embrace policies that led to economic ruin in Venezuela. In a crowded field of nearly two dozen candidates\u00a0\u2013 and a strong desire to beat Trump in November\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the criticism has resonated with some. \"I fundamentally disagree that we should do away with the democratic, regulated capitalism that has guided this country for over 200 years,\" said former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democat who is also seeking the presidential nomination. \"This position is shared by many of my Democratic colleagues, but for some reason, our party has been hesitant to express their opposition to democratic socialism.\" More: Bernie Sanders to defend democratic socialism in face of attacks Jim Kessler, executive vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way, said the socialist tag, if it sticks, could be damaging\u00a0to Democrats. In November, both Trump and the Democratic nominee will be fighting for swing voters not tied rigidly to ideology. \u201cWe have never elected a national Democrat to the White House who is far to the left,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cWalter Mondale won one state. George McGovern won two. We are whistling past the graveyard if we think that's changed.\u201d More: Trump looks to pin 'socialism' label on Democrats before\u00a02020. Will it stick? For a nation that became the global counterweight to the Soviet Union after World War II, the term \"socialism\" has long been used as a stand-in for \"communism,\" and it has\u00a0been viewed as anathema to American politics. Sen. John McCain and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, used the word during the 2008 presidential campaign to attack Barack Obama's income tax proposals. During the 2016 Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton sought to use the S-word against Sanders, indicating she had heard from party officials who were \"concerned\" about the his policies. Clinton, who ran as a centrist, won the nomination, but it was Sanders who fired up much of the Democratic base. Sanders acknowledged opponents would continue to use the term socialism as a \u201cslur.\u201d \u201cI have faced and overcome these attacks for decades,\u201d Sanders said. Fifty-one percent\u00a0of U.S. adults say socialism would be a bad thing for the country, and 43% say\u00a0it would be a good thing,\u00a0according to a Gallup poll published last month. That marks a sharp contrast with a\u00a0Roper/Fortune survey in 1942 that found 40% describing socialism as a bad thing, 25% a good thing and 34% not having an opinion. Sanders stands alone among the field of nearly two dozen major Democratic presidential candidates to identify as a \u201cdemocratic socialist.\u201d\u00a0Sanders defined the philosophy as not shaped by Marxism\u00a0but rather embracing the ideals of President Roosevelt's New Deal. In practice, that has meant endorsing \"Medicare for all,\" which would allow\u00a0the government-run Medicare program for seniors to provide health insurance for every American. Sanders has supported\u00a0free\u00a0or debt-free college tuition, paid for by taxpayers, and the ambitious\u00a0Green New Deal to curb climate change. \"Economic rights are human rights,\" Sanders said. \"And that is what I mean by democratic socialism.\" Like what you\u2019re reading?

      "content": " Kid Rock has golfed shirtless in overalls, swigged beers on the links with John Daly, and gone red-white-and-blue for a round\u00a0with the president. But he played it low-key on Tuesday at Detroit Golf Club, where he was part of the 313 Area Celebrity Challenge, a three-team scramble,\u00a0ahead of the Rocket Mortgage Classic PGA tour event. There were no crazy outfits, no wild shenanigans, not even a drink in hand, as the cigar-chomping Michigan rocker joined a team with pro golfer Rickie Fowler, the Red Wings' Justin Abdelkader and Golf Channel host Blair O'Neal. \"There's always tomorrow!\" he told the Free Press ahead of the afternoon outing. He'll be back Wednesday at Detroit Golf Club, where he's a member, for an 18-hole pro-am competition. Shouts of \"Let's go, Bobby!\" and \"American bad (expletive)!\" rang out from the gallery Tuesday as Rock teed off on the competition's fourth hole. An hour later, it was Rock hollering to\u00a0onlookers down the fairway as he hooked his drive left. A team\u00a0led by Dustin Johnson ultimately prevailed on the day, beating Rock and Fowler's team through a tiebreaker. More from Detroit Golf Club: Tom Izzo hard on his golf game, too: 'I didn't maim anybody' As with wild rock 'n' rollers like\u00a0Alice Cooper before him, golf has come to loom large in the leisure life of Kid Rock. He's uncharacteristically modest about his abilities (\"I stay in my lane\"), but said he feels less pressure now than when he started playing in public events a decade ago. He was turned on to the game by his lead guitarist, Marlon Young, with encouragement from drinking buddy Daly. \"These guys were doing it so much on the road,\" he said of his touring band.\u00a0\"And I'm sitting there in the hotel room bored. I had visited every antique shop and strip club when we were younger.\u00a0So it's something productive to do.\" Moreover, Rock said, \"Where else am I going to spend five hours uninterrupted with the (expletive) president? Who gets to do that?\" Kid Rock was alluding to his \"awesome\" March round of golf with President Donald Trump, where they talked politics among \"everything else.\" Trump, he said, was \"down-to-earth and cool.\" \"I always thought Obama was cool as (expletive). I didn't like his politics, but I'm like: That's one cool-ass (expletive). You kind of have to be for president,\" Rock said. \"Trump was just off the map, I have to say. And that's politics aside.\" The May golf outing was Kid Rock's second encounter with President Trump, following a 2017 White House dinner with Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent. More: Michigan rockers Kid Rock, Ted Nugent meet and dine with Donald Trump March also included an\u00a0outing where Kid Rock nailed his first hole-in-one \u2014 with golf giant Jack Nicklaus looking on. \"How do you top that? That's just my stupid luck,\" Rock said, laughing. \"After that, golf seems pretty much (pointless)\u00a0\u2014 like, how do you top that?\" Rock, who splits his time now among Nashville, Florida and his multiple Michigan homes, will be back in front of hometown audiences in September, when he plays four shows at DTE Energy Music Theatre.

Rock is a member of the Bears Club in Jupiter, Florida, founded by Nicklaus, and the two have become buddies. When Rock showed up in camouflage shorts at a pro-am event with Nicklaus, he said he offered an explanation to the 79-year-old legend: \"Make no mistake, Bob Ritchie is a member of this club, and he dresses appropriately. But (expletive), you're golfing with Kid Rock today.\" Contact Detroit Free Press music writer Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com.",

      "content": "  Many people heard of Stephanie Grisham, President Donald Trump's new\u00a0White House press secretary,\u00a0for the first time Tuesday. What they don't know is the bumpy ride\u00a0\u2014 much of it in Arizona\u00a0\u2014 that preceded her move into the national spotlight. Grisham, 42, was born in Washington state and began her professional career in Arizona, records show. She declined to comment about her path to one of the most high-profile jobs in government. Those who know and worked with Grisham describe a woman who brought professionalism and dogged advocacy to her jobs, even as she faced personal challenges behind the scenes. Jobs with increasing pressure, financial problems and drunken-driving arrests shaped her life before she became the new voice of the White House. New WH press secretary: President Trump hires Stephanie Grisham to replace Sarah Sanders as press secretary If Trump seems under siege from his many critics, he has tapped a spokeswoman who has helped manage high-profile\u00a0embattled officials before. Grisham\u2019s mother, Ann Schroder of Nebraska, told The Arizona Republicshe is\u00a0\"excited and thrilled\"\u00a0for her daughter, but otherwise declined to discuss Grisham's life. Similarly, Grisham\u2019s ex-husband Dan Marries told The Republic he\u2019s happy for Grisham. Marries, a former firefighter for the Bureau of Land Management, is an evening news anchor for KOLD News 13 in Tucson. Marries said he and Grisham married in 1997. Court records show the couple filed for divorce in 2004. Marries called the divorce amicable. They have a son. She has a second son. Trump-Putin: Trump defends his exchange with Vladimir Putin over election meddling Grisham began voting in Arizona as a registered Democrat in 1997, when she was in her early 20s, according to the Arizona Secretary of State's Office. She didn't become a Republican for at least a decade. There is no record she voted in the 2016 election in which she was heavily involved. Grisham's rapid\u00a0rise within Arizona Republican politics can be traced to her meeting\u00a0Republican Tom Horne, who was the state's superintendent of public schools. At the time, he said, she was working\u00a0with the Arizona Charter Schools Association. According to Horne,\u00a0Grisham saw how Horne\u00a0handled historical trivia questions from students and decided to work with him after he was elected Arizona attorney general in 2010. She also worked for\u00a0Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, for AAA Arizona, and had formed Sound Bite Public Relations\u00a0LLC. Marianne Williamson: Republicans start donating to Marianne Williamson to keep her in future Democratic debates Grisham's tenure as Horne's press secretary, who served one term as attorney general, thrust her name into the Arizona news. Horne wound up\u00a0the target of an FBI investigation into allegations of campaign-finance wrongdoing.\u00a0Grisham tried to cast him and the office as functional even as\u00a0Horne's political career was unraveling. After Republican Mark Brnovich defeated Horne in the 2014 GOP primary, Grisham landed as a spokeswoman for the Republican caucus for the Arizona House of Representatives. Then-House Speaker David Gowan, R-Sierra Vista, soon found himself under public scrutiny for charging $12,000 in personal and campaign travel expenses to taxpayers. During Grisham's tenure at the state House, Gowan issued a new rule in 2016 that required reporters to undergo extensive background checks in order to access the floor of the chamber. 'Lives depend on it': AG William Barr declares public safety 'emergency' in Alaska The unprecedented order was widely viewed as retribution for hard-hitting coverage by the Arizona Capitol Times\u2019 Hank Stephenson, who broke the story of\u00a0Gowan\u2019s use of state vehicles while running for Congress. Gowan, who said the measure was for security reasons, relented after reporters refused to submit to background checks and after criticism by state lawmakers from both sides of the aisle.\u00a0No other state required a criminal background check for reporters to be issued a press credential or obtain access to the legislative floor. Stephenson\u00a0described Grisham as \"very firm with her opposition or complaints\" about his coverage. The stories triggered apparent retaliation, he said. \"I still don\u2019t know how much of it was her brainchild or her job to deliver orders from her bosses,\" he said. The Democratic debates: 5 things we learned from two nights of debates The newspaper's access to the House floor was revoked\u00a0\u2014 but later reinstated\u00a0\u2014 for opening day ceremonies. Then came the background checks, which were\u00a0widely seen by the Arizona press corps as retaliation for Stephenson's reporting, a view he shared. \"There's no question in my mind that's what that was about,\" Stephenson said. Former Democratic state Rep. Ken Clark\u00a0of Phoenix said Grisham was \"the constant apologist\" for Gowan's \"terrible\" leadership during his tenure as speaker. Former state Rep. Bob Robson, R-Chandler, said Grisham didn't deserve the blame. \"She was very good at getting out the message that she was asked to get out,\" he said. \"She performed very well at a time with a lot of turmoil, quite candidly. I think she was blamed for a lot of things she didn\u2019t do. \u2026 She took \u2026 the hit.\" Sometimes hits\u00a0came from her own party. State Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, a Scottsdale Republican who served in the House in 2015, tangled with Grisham publicly at a party after a political awards show, according to a\u00a0June 24, 2015, write-up of the altercation that relied on anonymous sources in the Yellow Sheet Report, a political insider newsletter published by the Arizona Capitol Times. Jimmy Carter on Trump: Donald Trump blasts Jimmy Carter as a 'nice man' but a 'terrible president' Grisham won the \"Best PR Person\" award from the\u00a0Arizona Capitol Times that year. There were no signs of bad blood this week. \"Look, I'm not interested in tearing someone down,\" Ugenti-Rita said. \"She's a qualified individual who has accomplished some really amazing stuff, and I sincerely wish her all the best and only congratulations are going to come from me.\" Not long after the incident, Grisham connected with Trump's nascent presidential campaign in 2015 as he was set to make an early appearance in downtown Phoenix. State Rep. Travis Grantham, R-Gilbert, dealt with Grisham as she helped organizea later Trump event\u00a0in the hangar of a Mesa business that Grantham owned at the time. When is the next debate?: The next Democratic primary debate is July 30 and 31 in Detroit \"She helped set up the stage, set up the angles, made sure the event ran smoothly,\" Grantham said in an interview from Afghanistan, where he is\u00a0deployed. \"She did a great job. ... We were very happy with how the event turned out.\" So was Trump. He kept Grisham on the campaign and brought her into the White House after his surprise victory. On the campaign, she helped manage the traveling press corps. In the White House, she was named deputy press secretary before becoming first lady Melania Trump's spokeswoman. Even as Grisham's professional success grew, she grappled with\u00a0personal problems at home. On Jan. 9, 2013, when she was working for Horne, Gilbert police arrested Grisham on suspicion of driving under the influence and driving faster than reasonable, records show. She planned to go to trial and the matter dragged out for more than a year\u00a0before she pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless driving in August 2014. She spent a night in jail and was placed on two years' probation. The case returned to court twice over Grisham's failure to pay the $779 in fines and her not completing a session with Mothers Against Drunk Driving about the impact of impaired driving. SCOTUS and abortion: Supreme Court refuses to hear Alabama's defense of abortion ban struck down last year Horne said Tuesday he wasn't aware of Grisham's run-in with the law. \"I don\u2019t know about it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really relevant,\"\u00a0Horne said of Grisham's DUI case. \"She did a fabulous job. She was a great colleague, very friendly, conscientious, great advocate, had a good relationship with the press, and she\u2019ll do a great job.\" On Dec. 5, 2015, months after joining the Trump campaign, Grisham found trouble again. Scottsdale police arrested her that night on suspicion of DUI and driving without her headlights on shortly after midnight. She failed to show in court on Jan. 19, 2016, a day when Trump received the endorsement of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in Ames, Iowa. Her absence in court cost Grisham her driver\u2019s license for a month. Debate winners and losers: The winners and losers from 2 nights of sparring at the Democratic debates in Miami Grisham pleaded guilty to misdemeanor DUI in July 2016, days before her attendance at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where Trump officially became the GOP nominee. As part of that case, she had to pay nearly $1,600 in fines and fees, records show. Two weeks after Trump\u2019s victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, Grisham failed to appear in Scottsdale court again. That was the day Trump convened a meeting with national media figures at Trump Tower in New York to shred them for coverage of his campaign. Grisham finished paying her debt in the case on Jan. 9, 2017, less than two weeks before Trump was sworn into office. She disclosed the DUI arrests to the White House during the transition, according to the Washington Post. Grisham had another debt to settle at that\u00a0time. In March 2017, Capital One Bank sued Grisham in Maricopa County Superior Court over an unpaid debt totaling about $1,700. Three days later,\u00a0Melania Trump named Grisham her communications director. Trump and Kim: Trump on possible Korean DMZ meeting with Kim Jong Un: 'We'll see' The debt wasn't settled until\u00a0April 2018, according to court records. Her co-workers said her work never suffered. Robson recalled Grisham as a professional who worked with the dozens of GOP lawmakers to arrange media interviews, write opinion columns and posts for social media. \"I knew (the arrests) were there, but I didn\u2019t think they inhibited the job,\"\u00a0he said. \"There are people that work with DUIs in newspaper reporting. It\u2019s unfortunate, but that stuff will\u00a0happen. Human frailty\u00a0has to be dealt with.\" Arizona Republic reporter Jeannette Hinkle contributed to this report. Reach Ronald J.

Lindsey Graham angrily told reporters, \"I don't remember John McCain having to go through this crap every day.\" Graham made the remark when CNN's Manu Raju asked him\u00a0how much the Republican Party had changed in light of the \"send her back\" chant that Trump supporters leveled at Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., at a North Carolina rally on Wednesday. Raju contrasted that with how\u00a0McCain famously defended his Democratic opponent in the 2008 presidential race, then-Sen. Barack Obama, from a woman at a rally\u00a0who said she did not trust Obama because he was \"an Arab.\" \"No ma'am,\" McCain said at that Oct. 2008 rally\u00a0before\u00a0taking the microphone from the audience member. \"He's a decent, family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.\" Earlier at that\u00a0rally in Lakeville, Minnesota, another man told McCain, \"We're scared of an Obama presidency.\" \"I want to be president of the United States and obviously I do not want Sen. Obama to be,\" McCain responded. \"But I have to tell you, he is a decent person and a person that you do not have to be scared as president of the United States.\" That response drew boos from some members of\u00a0the audience. \"I was proud of John,\" Graham said Thursday. \"My differences with President Obama were real but I never doubt that he loved the country.\" The South Carolina Republican was a close friend of McCain, who died in August 2018. \"President Trump would never do that,\" Raju said. \"He took a different tack. He's fighting back,\" Graham said. But he said he didn't remember \"anybody treating John McCain the way they're treating Trump. I don't remember John McCain having to go through this crap every day, all the time.\" \"Something I have learned: If you are a Republican nominee for President \u2013\u00a0or President \u2013 you will be accused of being a racist.,\" Graham tweeted later on Thursday. \"John Lewis compared John McCain\u2019s campaign to being like that of George Wallace. It comes with the territory unfortunately.\" The day after McCain's 2008 rally in Minnesota, Rep. John Lewis. D-Ga., said he was \"deeply disturbed by the negative tone of the McCain-Palin campaign\" and accused them \"sowing the seeds of hate and division,\" comparing it to the \"atmosphere of hate\" created by segregationist Gov. George Wallace. Later the same night. Lewis issued a clarification, which said it was\u00a0not his intention to \"compare Sen. John McCain or Gov. Sarah Palin to George Wallace.\" \"I am glad that Sen. McCain has taken some steps to correct divisive speech at his rallies,\" Lewis said, apparently in light of McCain's comments the day before. Trump has faced heavy criticism this week following tweets that told four progressive congresswomen of color to \"go back\" to their\u00a0countries of origin and fix the problems there before\u00a0\"telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run.\" At his rally Wednesday, Trump said Omar, along with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, \"hate our country\" and, \"If they don't like it, let them leave.\" All four women are U.S. citizens. When Trump went after Omar\u00a0\u2013 who was born in Somalia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the crowd began to chant, \"send her back. Though Trump did not object to the chanting at the time, on Thursday he told reporters, \"I wasn't happy with that message.\" \"Let me be clear, my beef is with policy, not personality,\" Graham said Thursday when asked about the chants. \"All of these congressmen won their elections. They're American citizens. This is their home as much as mine. \"I believe their policies will change America for the worse, and that's the debate for me.\" Graham also told reporters he did not believe Trump was being racist with his comments, which he compared to the 1960s refrain of \"love it or leave it\" that was often leveled against protesters opposed to the Vietnam War. \"A\u00a0Somali refugee embracing Trump would not have been asked to go back,\" Graham said. \"If you're a racist you want everybody from Somalia to go back because they're black or they're Muslim.\" Somalia was one of the nations in each version of Trump's controversial travel ban. Before his death, McCain was one Trump's fiercest Republicans critics. In 2016 he told The New Yorker that Trump had \"fired up the crazies.\" \"We have a very extreme element within our Republican Party,\"\u00a0McCain said. \"Now he galvanized them\" and \"really got them activated.\"",

      "subtitle": "On the second night of the second Democratic primary debate, Joe Biden was center stage, and took the brunt of challenger attacks. Biden was prepped.\n    USA TODAY",
      "author": "",
      "content": "Democrats have proved\u00a0they have a big tent. Now it\u2019s time to kick the clowns out. We have now watched four Democratic debates in which\u00a0the vast majority of the participants have about 1% or less support in the polls. And what have we learned from this? Way too many names. With 10\u00a0people on stage answering questions about trillion dollar policies in half-minute blips, the debates resembled AOL\u00a0chat rooms more than a rhetorical standoff between Lincoln and Douglas. Candidates desperate to creep into the next round of debates seek any way to claw themselves into the discourse and end up debating the moderators, spewing questions that often seem\u00a0they were posed by the White House press secretary, as much as each other. Let\u2019s take a breath and focus on what we do know. Barring a miracle or a mass kidnapping, the Democratic nominee to take on President Donald Trump will be Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris or Pete Buttigieg \u2014 if he holds on to the donors who helped him rake in more than any other candidate, $24.8 million, in the last quarter. Four debates have barely changed that. Biden recognized that Harris almost delivered a TKO\u00a0to his campaign in the first debate and decided to greet the senator from California on Wednesday with,\u00a0\u201cTake it easy on me, kid.\u201d It functioned as a variation on Sarah Palin\u2019s \u201cCan I call you Joe?\u201d move that opened the 2008 vice presidential debate. Though it might have come off as smarmy and belittling to some, especially women, it set a tone that Biden would come out swinging, with \u201cP-A-L-OF-O-B-A-M-A\u201d tattooed on his knuckles. The former vice president also fended off telegraphed attacks by Sens.\u00a0Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand. Booker took on his criminal justice record and Gillibrand his comments from the early 1980s when, as a\u00a0senator, he said women working outside the home were \"avoiding responsibility.\" Biden's responses were\u00a0far from impressive. But ties go to the front-runner.\u00a0Biden is nearly doubling his closest opponent in the polls\u00a0and seems to have shaken off the \u201cJeb Bush of 2020\u201d sign that many commentators, including me, tried to pin to his back. Biden\u2019s greatest asset thus far might\u00a0be not having to be on stage with both Sanders and Warren, whose withering critiques of our political and economic system necessarily indict his four decades at the top of American politics. Beyond those leading the field,\u00a0there is a second tier of fine candidates who would be front-runners in a normal year, including Booker, Gillibrand, former Housing\u00a0and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. There are a couple who would be formidable\u00a0were they running for the Senate, namely former Texas Rep.\u00a0Beto O\u2019Rourke and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. And Montana Gov. Steve Bullock deserves some consideration for being the only candidate who has actually won a statewide election in a red state. Detroit Night One: Odd couple: Marianne Williamson, Bernie Sanders were among the Democratic debate standouts The rest of the candidates have so little to lose and such a minuscule chance of winning that they\u2019re wasting all of our time and some of our brain cells.\u00a0But who can blame a politician for seeking free prime time? The Democratic National Committee is doing its best to avoid the debacles of 2016 \u2014as\u00a0Republicans nominated a birther known for his ability to bankrupt casinos and\u00a0Democrats were divided by charges that the party's leadership favored\u00a0Hillary Clinton and Russian hacks amplified those divisions. But the DNC strategy has\u00a0crammed all the candidates into two NCAA-like brackets that pit the top seed against small state schools lucky to make the tournament. The result is a mess that makes a mockery of the seriousness of this moment. This is the most consequential primary of our lifetime for too many reasons \u2014 the foremost being that Donald Trump is the president of the United States. He has an attorney general who has all but declared that if a Republican president does it, it\u2019s legal. He wants to appoint a man to run our intelligence community who seems to think investigating attacks on our democracy is a bigger threat\u00a0than the attacks themselves. And then there\u2019s the climate crisis. Inslee\u00a0has centered his campaign on confronting carbon pollution. As he put it Wednesday night,\u00a0\u201cI am running for president because the people in this room and the Democrats watching tonight are the last best hope for humanity on this planet.\u201d This is both true and \u2014 if you tried to digest all four of these messy debates \u2014 terrifying. Ideally, this will be the last Democratic primary for the next eight\u00a0years, and not because Trump\u00a0declared martial law and refused to leave office. There is still time to get this right. Time to cull:\u00a0Winners, losers and who needs to drop out Relegating\u00a0the also-rans to earlier, separate debates in 2016 might\u00a0be the only good idea Republicans have come up with in this century. The next Democratic debates are scheduled for Sept.\u00a012 and 13 in\u00a0Houston. Only Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, Buttigieg, O\u2019Rourke and Booker have qualified so far. Let\u2019s hope the DNC sees the wisdom of one debate with just the top contenders from now on. One clown in the White House is plenty. Let\u2019s clear out the center ring and have a real debate.

      "content": " Sarah Palin called it a \"gut punch\" to be \"publicly disinvited\" to Sen. John McCain's funeral last year. Palin, the former Alaska governor, was McCain's running mate in the 2008 presidential election\u00a0and was the first woman nominated by the Republican Party to be vice president. In a\u00a0television\u00a0interview on \"Good Morning Britain\"on Monday, Palin said she was surprised to find she was on the list of people who had been close with McCain\u00a0who didn't get an invite\u00a0to the funeral. \"They didn't have to embarrass me and embarrass others,\" she said. \"And it wasn't just me, it was other good people in our campaign back in 2008 who were very, very loyal to Senator McCain.\" Cindy McCain: Late senator's wife tweets aggressive message she received about husband, Meghan McCain McCain-Trump feud: What's driving the feud? War record, Obamacare among the themes In \"The Restless Wave,\" his final memoir, out\u00a0in April 2018, McCain, R-Ariz., said he regretted choosing Palin as his running mate. He said he wished he had gone with his friend\u00a0former Sen. Joseph\u00a0Lieberman, I-Conn. But in the same book, McCain defended Palin. \"She stumbled in some interviews, and had a few misjudgments in the glare of the ceaseless spotlight and unblinking cameras,\" McCain wrote. \"Those missteps, too, are on me. She didn't put herself on the ticket. I did. I asked her to go through an experience that was wearing me down, that wears every candidate down. I made mistakes and misjudgments, too.\" Palin attributes the ridicule she faced during and after the 2008 race to a poorly run presidential campaign. The GOP ticket lost to Democrats Barack Obama and Joe Biden. \"They were looking for someone to blame for the really crappy type of campaign they ran,\" she said. \"And I was a scapegoat. So that's just in the past, though. Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn, and I certainly learned through that.\" Palin said she and the six-term senator had \"a perfectly fine relationship,\" and their families got along. She said she corresponded with Meghan McCain, McCain's daughter, expressing her condolences about McCain's illness, a deadly form of brain cancer. McCain died Aug. 25. \"I heard it from the media \u2013 I didn't hear it from him \u2013 that he was disappointed,\" Palin said. While he was alive, McCain was\u00a0always complimentary of Palin in his public remarks. \"Sarah and I have maintained a very close and warm relationship,\" he told The Arizona Republic in 2014.

      "content": "NEW DELHI \u2013 Indian lawmakers passed a bill Tuesday that strips statehood from the Indian-administered portion of Muslim-majority Kashmir, which remains under an indefinite security lockdown, actions that archrival Pakistan warned could lead to war. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist-led government submitted the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill for a vote by the lower house of Parliament a day after the surprise measure was introduced alongside a presidential order. That order dissolved a constitutional provision, known as Article 370, which gave Kashmiris exclusive hereditary rights and a separate constitution. \u201cAfter five years, seeing development in J&K (Jammu and Kashmir) under the leadership of PM Modi, people of the valley will understand drawbacks of Article 370,\u201d Indian Home Minister Amit Shah said just before the bill was passed. Kashmir is claimed by both India and Pakistan and divided between them. Two of the three wars the nuclear-armed neighbors have fought since their independence from British rule were over Kashmir. Yemen: Airport closure is 'death sentence' for thousands of sick civilians How the 7 million people in the Kashmir Valley were reacting was unclear, because the Indian government shut off most communication with it, including internet, cellphone and landline networks. Thousands of additional troops were deployed to the already heavily militarized region out of fear the government\u2019s steps could spark unrest. Kashmir is India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state and most people there oppose Indian rule. Indian TV news channels in Srinagar, the main city in India\u2019s portion of Kashmir, showed security personnel including armed soldiers in camouflage standing near barbed wire barricades in the otherwise empty streets. Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police Dilbagh Singh said Srinagar was \u201ctotally peaceful,\u201d the Press Trust of India news agency reported. Hundreds of people around Pakistan and the portion of Kashmir it controls rallied against Modi, burning him in effigy and torching Indian flags to condemn India\u2019s moves. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said in an address to Parliament on Tuesday night that he feared the Kashmiri people could attack Indian security forces out of anger and New Delhi could blame Pakistan for it. \u201cIf India attacks us, we will respond,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe will fight until the last drop of blood.\u201d Back from the dead: Sarah Palin's defamation lawsuit against New York Times In February, a bombing in Indian-controlled Kashmir killed 40 Indian troops. India responded with an airstrike inside Pakistan, blaming a Pakistani group for the attack. The Pakistani military was on high alert Tuesday following reports that New Delhi was continuing to send additional troops to its portion of Kashmir. Pakistan\u2019s top military commanders met in the garrison city of Rawalpindi to discuss the changes in Kashmir. China, which also lays claim to a portion of Kashmir, is \u201cseriously concerned\u201d about the situation, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. \u201cThe relevant sides need to exercise restraint and act prudently. In particular, they should refrain from taking actions that will unilaterally change the status quo and escalate tensions,\u201d she said. The bill passed in India\u2019s Parliament changes Jammu and Kashmir from a state to a union territory with a legislature, and carves out Buddhist-majority Ladakh, a pristine, sparsely populated area that stretches from the Siachen Glacier to the Himalayas, as a separate union territory without a legislature. The lower house approved the bill Tuesday, a day after upper house approved it by a two-thirds majority, with many opposition lawmakers voting with the ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. It was unclear when the security measures would be eased in Kashmir, but an outpouring of condemnation by Kashmiris living outside the region or who were able to access the internet despite the government blocks suggest the population will resist the New Delhi government\u2019s actions. El Paso wasn't the first incident: Walmart wrestles with how to respond to active shooters Ordinary Kashmiris have feared the measures would be a prelude to intensifying an ongoing crackdown against anti-India dissenters. Rebels have been fighting Indian control for decades, and most Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 demand that all of Kashmir be united under Pakistani rule or become independent. Security lockdowns, general strikes and civilian street demonstrations against Indian control are routine. About 70,000 people have been killed in the rebel uprising and the ensuing Indian crackdown.

China\u2019s move to stabilize its currency helped to calm jittery investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up around 312 points, or 1.2%, to nearly 26,030, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 rose 37 points, or 1.3%, to almost\u00a02,882 on Tuesday.

China allowed the yuan to drop to seven per U.S. dollar, an 11-year low and a politically sensitive level, while its central bank blamed the devaluation on \"trade protectionism.\u201d News that the country also planned to halt purchases of all U.S. agricultural goods further fueled the sell-off on Monday.

      "content": " Sacha Baron Cohen is done going undercover. Instead, he\u2019s playing Israel\u2019s most famous spy. \u201cI am done with the undercover work,\u201d Cohen says\u00a0in an interview this week. The English actor\u2019s character-driven comedies \u2013 which often doubled as political satire\u00a0\u2013\u00a0spanned films (2006's \u201cBorat,\" 2009's \"Bruno,\u201d 2012's \"The Dictator\") and TV shows (HBO's \"Da Ali G Show,\u201d Showtime's \u201cWho Is America\u201d). But those prankster-driven passion projects, which had Cohen interviewing everyone from Sarah Palin to O.J. Simpson, took a toll on the 47-year-old actor, who has three children with his actress wife, Isla Fisher. \u2018It\u2019s incredibly consuming in every aspect,\" he says.\u00a0\"It\u2019s draining.\u00a0It can be dangerous. It\u2019s often unrewarding. You\u2019re living a fairly miserable life. Obviously, when you produce good stuff, then it\u2019s rewarding in the end. But the process itself is not fun.\u201d Friday, Cohen ditches his comedy roots for \"The Spy,\" a chilling\u00a0six-episode Netflix series created by Gideon Raff (\u201cHomeland\u201d). Cohen plays real-life Mossad agent Eli Cohen, who went undercover\u00a0in Syria in the 1960s as a wealthy businessman who swiftly climbed\u00a0the\u00a0political ranks. (Despite sharing a last name, the late spy and the Jewish actor, whose mother was born in Israel, are not related.) Memorable Sacha Baron Cohen moments: From Borat's mankini to the Ryan Seacrest ash-dumping Over six years, the real Mossad agent provided intelligence to Israeli forces that helped stop Syria\u2019s burgeoning nuclear program, ultimately helping\u00a0Israel prevail in 1967\u2019s Six-Day War.\u00a0But it also required living apart from his young family, eventually resulting in his capture and public hanging. \u201cI see Eli Cohen as perhaps the greatest character actor of the past century, because he stayed in character for many years. I think he puts Daniel Day-Lewis to shame,\u201d says Cohen, whose family had a copy of a book about him, \"Our Man in Damascus,\"\u00a0on its bookshelf in London. Cohen\u00a0took the Netflix role six months after his own father died. Cohen, who has dabbled in dramatic roles including \u201cLes Miserables\u201d and \u201cHugo,\"\u00a0says he was not wholly unprepared to play an at-risk spy. Going undercover in his comedic characters, \"if I make a mistake, if there\u2019s a tell, the interview has ended and the subject walks out. And there can be worse repercussions:\u00a0The rodeo in \"Borat\" or the cage fight in \"Bruno\" \u2013 had people seen through it, the results could have been quite violent,\" he says. \"I was never risking my life,\u00a0\u00a0but I could imagine the stakes of an interview or an encounter going wrong. A lot of what I do when I\u2019m in character is I am trying to read the other person \u2026 which obviously Eli was doing as well.\u201d In \u201cThe Spy,\u201d Cohen builds such a rich double life as a fat-cat Syrian businessman that he struggles when returning to his humble life with wife Nadia in Israel. In his own life, Cohen says, he sheds his characters easily. \"It can be a matter of seconds at the end of the shoot day,\" he says, though playing\u00a0Bruno, the\u00a0Austrian fashionista,  gave off a bit of PTSD\u00a0for months after the 2009\u00a0film wrapped.\u00a0\"Whenever I heard a police siren, I experienced a little bit of anxiousness because I was so used to the police coming to arrest me.\" Cohen\u00a0remains invested in politics, though he calls \"The Spy\" a story about \"three-dimensional people, rather than (just) enemies and heroes.\" On the Moroccan set,\u00a0Cohen quizzed cast members, including Arab Muslims, Palestinian Arabs, Israeli Arabs and African Muslims, on whether they felt the script was biased, and he engaged in casual conversations about political solutions in the Middle East. But publicly, Cohen is keeping his cards closer to his chest.\u00a0Despite\u00a0the looming 2020 election and his native country\u00a0agonizing over Brexit, he has no plans to add his voice, comedically or otherwise. \u201cI\u2019m still very frustrated about\u00a0the news, and there are still things I read that worry me deeply or get me angry,\u201d says Cohen, who will next play activist\u00a0Abbie Hoffman in Aaron Sorkin\u2019s \"Trial of the Chicago 7.\" \"'Who is America?'\u00a0was a way to do something personally. I had to make that show to deal with the stress of what was going on with the country at the time. Whenever I do these things, I don\u2019t know if anyone will ever agree with me, or find it remotely interesting or even funny. But they are often projects that I feel compelled to do.\" He pauses. \"We shall see.\"",

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals restored the lawsuit Tuesday, saying Palin must be allowed to collect evidence to support her claims. Still, it said Palin's burden of proof was high to show the Times acted with actual malice when it published an editorial titled \"America's Lethal Politics\" in 2017. The onetime Republican vice presidential nominee sued over the editorial published after a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers in Virginia, wounding U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise. The Times' editorial was corrected twice when readers complained it appeared to blame a political action committee belonging to Palin for \"political incitement.\" A Times' spokesperson says the newspaper is disappointed and will vigorously fight the lawsuit.

Here's the news everyone's talking about Tuesday. But first, everything's bigger better in Texas:\u00a0West University Place, Texas, was named\u00a0one of the best cities to live in. Did your city make the list? President Donald Trump fired\u00a0John Bolton as his national security adviser\u00a0Tuesday, noting that the two\u00a0\"disagreed strongly\" on many issues.\u00a0Trump wrote in a tweet,\u00a0\"I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House.\"\u00a0But Bolton said\u00a0he offered to resign,\u00a0contradicting Trump's characterization\u00a0of his departure. He texted several reporters that he had not been fired, as the president said. Bolton's departure comes amid internal tension at the White House, particularly\u00a0over negotiations with the Taliban and the president's hopes for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Other things he said, they said: Apple unveiled the brand-spanking-new iPhone 11\u00a0on Tuesday during its annual event at its\u00a0headquarters in Cupertino, California. Apple is rolling\u00a0out three new phone models: a lower-priced iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max.\u00a0Dare I say I want them all? Because I do. All three smartphones will be available for preorder\u00a0Friday, and you can get your hands on one\u00a0for $699. Let's talk about this camera situation (look at the image below).\u00a0The Pro editions will sport a redesigned camera with a third lens that can capture extreme wide-angle shots. Hello, group selfies.\u00a0But wait! There's more: Apple unveiled new versions of its iPad and Apple Watch. The Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition released a few images from its\u00a02019 contest \u2013 and they're incredible.\u00a0The photo contest, representing plant and animal life from across the globe, is developed annually by the Natural History Museum in London.

One Short List reader got a close-up look at the overturned vessel with her dog, Samuel. \"I was out playing ball, and you can see the cargo ship in the background,\" Denise Rocawich, who lives in Brunswick, Georgia, said.\u00a0\"Glad to hear that all the crew has gotten out safely.\" As Hurricane Dorian approached\u00a0the Bahamas, John Slack knew better than to stay in his house.

The court documents\u00a0appear\u00a0to show that Todd Palin asked to dissolve the 31-year-marriage, citing \u201cincompatibility of temperament between the parties such that they find it impossible to live together as husband and wife,\u201d according to the Anchorage Daily News. The documents use\u00a0their initials instead of full names: T.M.P against S.L.P, respectively, as Todd\u2019s middle name is Mitchell and Sarah\u2019s is Louise, the AP reported. The documents accurately cite the Palins' marriage date as August 29, 1988, and the birthdates for the couple correspond as well, the AP also reported. The documents also list a child under initials T.P.V.P born April 18, 2008, also according to the AP.\u00a0The youngest Palin child, Trig Paxson Van Palin, was born that day. The rest of the couple's children are over the age of 18. Sarah Palin rose overnight to national prominence when John McCain tapped her to run as his VP in 2008 on the GOP ticket against Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The divorce filing was first reported by Anchorage blogger Craig Medred and the Anchorage Daily News.",
