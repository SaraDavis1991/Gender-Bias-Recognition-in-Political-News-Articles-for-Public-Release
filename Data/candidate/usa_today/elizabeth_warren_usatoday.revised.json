      "content": "Polling shows one of the most decisive factors for Democratic primary voters is which candidate\u2019s the best equipped to defeat President\u00a0Donald Trump in a general election They understand that the country cannot afford four more years of Trump\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that failure\u2019s not an option, although it\u2019s still a clear possibility. It\u2019s now increasingly clear that Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0of Massachusetts is the Democratic candidate most likely to beat Trump in 2020. To understand why, take a close look at what really happened in 2016. The Trump victory didn\u2019t result mainly from a mass exodus of blue-collar Democratic voters to the Republican candidate. It\u2019s true that 9.8% of voters changed their votes from 2012 to 2016. But only 3.6% of voters moved from President Barack\u00a0Obama to Trump.\u00a0More than half of these were offset by the 1.9% who switched from Mitt Romney to Hillary Clinton \u2014 leaving a net loss of only 1.7%. The lion\u2019s share of vote-changers\u00a0were the 4.3% of the voters who moved from Obama in 2012 to a third-party candidate or to not voting for any presidential candidate\u00a0in 2016. Of course, much of the net loss of vote-changers\u00a0was concentrated in critical electoral states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio. The loss of white working-class voters to Trump was definitely a component of Clinton\u2019s defeat. But a greater component was that so many former Obama voters elected not to vote at all or vote for a third-party candidate. There are five reasons why Warren is best equipped to deal with these challenges: \u25baPolls show Warren\u2019s message that the economic system is rigged against ordinary people \u2014\u00a0and her willingness to unapologetically call for fundamental structural changes in the rules of the economic game \u2014\u00a0are very attractive to white working-class vote-switchers\u00a0in the upper Midwest who haven\u2019t had a raise that outstrips inflation in 30 years. These voters don\u2019t want continuity or stability,\u00a0they want change. That\u2019s why many switched their vote in 2016.\u00a0They believed Clinton represented the economic status quo. Elizabeth Warren's choice: 'Medicare for All' purity or a path to beating Trump? Warren\u2019s call to voters in the most recent debate couldn\u2019t be clearer: \u201cThe paths to America\u2019s middle class have gotten a lot smaller and a lot narrower. ... I know what\u2019s broken. I know how to fix it and I\u2019m going to lead the fight to get it done.\u201d Warren correctly understands that a populist economic message is necessary to move swing voters \u2014\u00a0not just the base. That message won\u2019t alienate 2016 vote-switchers\u00a0who moved from Romney to Clinton. They were motivated mainly by their disgust for Trump\u2019s cultural agenda.\u00a0That disgust isn\u2019t going away regardless of the Democratic candidate. Many pundits question whether voters in states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania will identify with a Harvard Law professor.\u00a0They forget that Warren grew up in Oklahoma.\u00a0The personal stories she tells are the stories of voters raised in places like small-town Iowa, not around Harvard Square.\u00a0Warren connects with working people because she can talk firsthand about their personal experiences\u00a0and her own. Her story \u2014\u00a0her University of Houston education\u00a0and her grit and tenacity to succeed\u00a0\u2014 inspires them. \u25baWarren\u00a0not only inspires white working-class voters, she inspires people of all sorts, particularly young people. She\u2019s the candidate best equipped to deal with the most critical factor that gave us Trump: low turnout. She\u2019ll inspire people to vote because they\u2019re inspired by people who stand tall for their beliefs\u00a0and are willing to fight for them. Voters are inspired by her passion,\u00a0her grasp of the problems they face,\u00a0her ability to formulate clear, understandable solutions\u00a0and her willingness to stand up for progressive values. \u25baIn 2020, being a woman is a political asset. It\u00a0promises to be the year that women strike back. Women are overwhelmingly disgusted by Trump. They\u2019re disgusted by his sexism, lack of empathy, macho blustering and crude disrespectful language.\u00a0They\u2019re disgusted when they see children ripped from mothers\u2019 arms at the border.\u00a0They\u2019re furious that he\u2019s placing anti-abortion justices on the Supreme Court. Women are mobilized like never before in American politics.\u00a0A woman heading the ticket gives American women one more reason to work their hearts out\u00a0and turn out in record numbers next fall. \u25baWarren and her team have demonstrated that they know how to organize a winning campaign. Her\u00a0campaign has crafted a strategy that has\u00a0lifted her consistently in the polls. Her team knows how to execute. They refuse to leave any stone unturned,\u00a0understanding that showing up is half of politics, and they know how to communicate respect for voters. The campaign\u2019s loaded with inspired, fired-up organizers and it\u2019s exciting and fun. Those are qualities of winning campaigns. \u25baFinally, voters don\u2019t commit to candidates just because they think they\u2019re smart\u00a0or make good speeches. They certainly don\u2019t evaluate candidates simply by comparing lists of issue positions. Voters commit themselves to candidates the same way people fall in love: They commit to candidates who make them feel good about themselves. That happens when candidates have \u201ccharisma.\u201d Experience shows there are four elements that make a candidate charismatic:\u00a0The candidate must be warm. She\u00a0must be approachable and communicate empathy.\u00a0Second, she must have presence, and be \u201cin the moment\u201d at all times \u2014\u00a0laser-focused on the people she's\u00a0with. The woman with a strategy: Elizabeth Warren knows what we're facing and she has plans, from Fox News to Facebook Third, she must exude true self-confidence \u2014\u00a0the kind that comes from overcoming ordinary self-doubts that pop up like devils in practically everyone. Finally, the candidate must be inspiring. That means making people feel they\u2019re part of something bigger than themselves, but also that they can each play a truly significant role in achieving that larger goal. Warren does all of these. For all those reasons, Elizabeth Warren is our best choice to defeat Trump. She\u2019s the most likely Democratic candidate to be the next U.S. president.

      "author": "Jeanine Santucci",
      "content": " The fourth round of the Democratic primary debates saw a record 12 candidates battling it out over top issues, while\u00a0the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is underway. The focus shifted from former Vice President Biden to Sen. Elizabeth Warren for attacks from 2020 rivals, which is surely in response to her mounting support in national polls. As with previous debates, personal attacks were on display despite some calls for civility. Here are a few of the top moments from Tuesday's debate: As expected, the first focus of this debate was the impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats. At its center is the allegation that Trump pressured Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden. When asked about his son's business interests in Ukraine during his vice presidency, Biden redirected the focus to Trump. The question came after Biden's declaration over the weekend that his family members won't have foreign business relationships if he is elected. Foreign business deals: Hunter Biden says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president \u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he (Hunter)\u00a0made.\u201d Hunter Biden\u00a0said in an interview with ABC News earlier in the day that he made a \"mistake\" and exercised \"poor judgement\" regarding the political consequences of his seat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company during his father's time in office. He denied any misconduct. Ukraine explainer: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases This debate was the first opportunity for Democratic candidates to come together on stage after the announcement of the impeachment probe, and candidates reaffirmed their support\u00a0with varying levels of enthusiasm. Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked why voters shouldn't be the ones to\u00a0determine whether Trump stays in office. \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d she said. \"I\u2019m still waiting to find out form him\u00a0how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in our election\u00a0makes America great again,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar. But Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard cautioned against purely political motives\u00a0while pursuing impeachment:\u00a0\"If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide a terribly divided country.\" Sen. Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long. \u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d Warren has slowly inched her way up in national polls, which most recently have shown her on top. She has narrowly overtaken Biden, who was the target of rivals' verbal attacks on the debate stage in the past. At this debate, it was\u00a0Warren's turn to take some hits. Warren was repeatedly pressed by moderators and opponents alike to address whether her universal health care plan will raise taxes for the middle class. As in previous debates, Warren refused to give a \"yes or no\" answer. Costs will go up for the most wealthy, Warren said, but \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.\" South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg called it \"a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer.\" \"No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole... is supposed to get filled,\" Buttigieg said regarding Warren's plan. Polls: Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in recent Democratic presidential primary polls More data: Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren lead the pack in polling before fourth Democratic debate in Ohio Klobuchar in particular used several opportunities to call out Warren. Klobuchar has long tried to distinguish herself in the primary field as a more moderate choice and electable against Trump. \"At least Bernie\u2019s being honest,\" Klobuchar said of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has acknowledged a tax hike for the middle class but overall lower costs after out-of-pocket health care expenses are eliminated under his plan. \u201cI\u00a0appreciate Elizabeth's work, but again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,\" Klobuchar said. On wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her \u201dultra-millionaire tax\u201d as the best plan.\u00a0\"I want to give a reality check to Elizabeth,\" she said. \u201cWe just have different approaches,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d According to CNN's tracker, Warren\u00a0had by far the most speaking time of the evening at over 22 minutes. Biden was behind her at about 16 minutes. At the last Democratic debate, O'Rourke made waves when he proclaimed, \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\" And he did not back down from that statement in this debate. O'Rourke's gun control plan includes a mandatory buyback program for military-style assault weapons. And while some of the candidates support that idea, Buttigieg has led Democrats in shooting down O'Rourke's proposal as unrealistic, calling it a\u00a0\u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support. More on\u00a0buyback debate: Chuck Schumer said Democrats don't agree with Beto O'Rourke on gun buybacks. Some do. \u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they\u2019re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups. Buttigieg said the problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cEveryone on this stage is determined to get something done. Everyone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don't agree with your particular idea of how to handle this.\u201d Calling Buttigieg's \"shiny object\" comment a mischaracterization, O'Rourke said,\u00a0\"I\u00a0don\u2019t care what that meant to me or my candidacy.\" Rather, he cares about the loved ones of those whose lives have been\u00a0lost to gun violence. \u201cI just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,\u201d Klobuchar weighed in on her opposition to mandatory buybacks. \u201cLet\u2019s not mess this up with this fight.\u201d In a first for the primary debates, moderators asked a few candidates whether their relatively old\u2014or young, in the case of Gabbard\u2014ages are strikes against them in this election. \"I'm healthy. I'm feeling great,\" Sanders, 78, said when asked if he is\u00a0\u201cup to the stress\u201d of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month that made his presence at this debate remarkable. Candidates' ages: 4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates. Here's what that looks like. Sanders, Biden and Warren were all asked whether their ages are in play in their ability to take office, but all said they consider it an advantage. Biden, 76, said that his age comes with the benefit of advanced wisdom. \u201cI will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office,\" he said. Warren, 70, said she'd\u00a0\"out-work, out-organize and outlast anyone,\" including Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. On the flip side, Gabbard, 38, is one of the youngest candidates along with Buttigieg, 37.\u00a0She said it was not fair for those questions to only go to the three oldest candidates and pointed to experience over age as important. After a September debate that didn't touch the issue of abortion, Harris drew applause from the crowd when she brought up the topic of women's health early in this debate. \"This is the sixth debate we've had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women's access to reproductive health care, which is under full on attack in America today,\" Harris said. She said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color \u201cwill die\u201d because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being \u201cout of touch\u201d with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker added his voice to that call. \"God bless Kamala, but women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight,\" he said. Later in the debate, some candidates pushed for protecting Roe v. Wade using the Supreme Court. Harris brought up her plan to pass \"preclearance laws\" that would require Justice Department\u00a0review before states passed anti-abortion laws. Klobuchar addressed Trump, who she said has attacked women's rights. \"You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women,\" she said.

      "subtitle": "Thursday night's Democratic presidential debate in  Houston, Texas made clear that there are three main candidates leading the field, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, according to AP Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace. (Sept. 13)\n    AP, AP",
      "author": "Susan Page",
      "content": " Elizabeth Warren has pulled within striking distance of Joe Biden for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk\u00a0University/USA TODAY Network\u00a0Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year.\u00a0Bernie Sanders is at 14%. While Warren trailed\u00a0Biden, the Massachusetts senator was\u00a0within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. It is the second poll in recent days to show her gaining on Biden in a key state:\u00a0She also has surged in Iowa, edging ahead of Biden in a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll released over the weekend. \"Nevada was Elizabeth Warren's weakest early state but this finding is validation that Warren has reached an important inflection point,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk Political Research Center. \"The Democratic nomination could now become a two-person race between Warren and Joe Biden, as she is positioning herself for a first or second place finish in the first three Democratic contests.\" Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 4%\u00a0and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and activist Tom Steyer at 3%. The poll of 500 likely Democratic caucus-goers, taken by landline and cell phone Sept. 19-23, has a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points. Issues in Nevada:: Poll respondents said top issues are health care, climate change. The race remains fluid. Nearly six in 10 of those surveyed, 58%, said they might change their mind before the caucuses, scheduled for February. Just 37% said their minds were \"firmly made up.\" The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the \"second choice\"\u00a0of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris. Warren insists it's too early to pay much attention to polls. \"I don't do polls,\" she told reporters when asked about the Iowa Poll. \"We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary election.\" Let's vote: When are the 2020 presidential election primaries? In national polls, Biden continues to have a durable lead among Democratic voters, now at 30% in the RealClearPolitics average of September surveys. Warren has moved into second place, at 19%, three points ahead of Sanders.\u00a0In New Hampshire, which holds the first presidential primary, the top three contenders are bunched within a few points of one another. Biden continues to have a yawning lead in South Carolina, which holds its contest a week after Nevada. National look: USA TODAY/Suffolk poll: Americans dread the 2020 election Nevada Democrats, like those across the country, care more about electability than ideology. By 20 points, 58%-38%, they said the most important thing for Democrats was to nominate a candidate who can defeat President Trump, rather than a candidate \"who reflects my priorities and values.\" Warren was boosted by her performance in the Democratic debate this month, the third of the series. Among those who watched the forum, she was the candidate most often cited as one who did better than they expected, by 23%. Biden was the candidate most often cited as one who did worse than they expected, at 22%. That could raise the stakes for both candidates in the next debate, slated for Oct. 15 and 16 on the campus of Otterbein University near Columbus, Ohio. And the spate of good news for Warren could carry a cost: Her\u00a0rise could well make her the target for her Democratic rivals on stage.",

      "content": "When it comes to doing things, Elizabeth Warren has a plan for everything \u2014 and she\u2019s happy to tell you all about it. But when it comes to paying for things, I'm sorry to say, the Massachusetts senator\u00a0dodges and deflects like a Donald Trump defender. It\u2019s estimated that \"Medicare for All\" will cost the federal government an extra $3 trillion a year.\u00a0That\u2019s more than $9,000 annually from every man, woman and child in America.\u00a0Despite being asked, again and again, Warren refuses to acknowledge that paying for this is going to require an across-the-board tax increase\u00a0\u2014 and a pretty massive one, at that. Instead, she keep talking about how \u201ccosts\u201d will go down\u00a0before she changes the subject to how stressful it is to have your insurance canceled when you get sick or when you have to cope with your mom having diabetes. That\u2019s very true, I\u2019m sure. But we\u2019re talking fiscal policy here. There\u2019s a very unpleasant collectivist feel to this. It\u2019s all very well to say you can\u2019t make an omelet\u00a0without breaking some eggs \u2026 unless you\u2019re the egg. About\u00a056% of Americans \u2014 more than 180 million \u2014\u00a0have private health insurance through an employer. Medicare for All would sweep that all away, whether the people who have that insurance like it or not, in the name of the common good. Perhaps worse, as Warren knows perfectly well but steadfastly refuses to admit, there are going to be winners and losers. Costs might\u00a0go down in the aggregate, but individuals and families aren\u2019t aggregates. Elizabeth Warren's choice:\u00a0'Medicare for All' purity or a path to beating Trump? For example, Warren keeps saying that the total you pay for health care would end up being less under Medicare for All because it will eliminate out-of-pocket costs like premiums and copays. That\u2019s an oversimplification at best, especially since she hasn\u2019t said how she would finance this enormously expensive project. But it is a given that everyone will pay higher taxes, and it\u2019s older people who spend more in premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs \u2014 a lot more. Consequently, older people will be far more likely to see these higher taxes offset by a decrease in the cost of their health care. By contrast, younger people and families at healthier stages of their lives would still be paying new taxes\u00a0but will see fewer benefits. On average, would people be better off with lower taxes and more disposable income to buy a home, invest, or raise a family when they were younger and then absorb higher health care costs when they are older? Or would they be better off forgoing that income and avoiding those health care costs later? I don\u2019t know, and neither does Sen.\u00a0Warren. But this is exactly the kind of thing we need to have an open and honest debate about. Warren is treating the American public like children and insisting that she knows best. This is foolish in the extreme. Even if she doesn\u2019t want to discuss the costs and trade-offs of Medicare for All, she can be sure that, should she become the Democratic nominee, the Republicans will do it for her. Her refusal to admit the obvious makes her look dishonest. Doing it wrong: 2020 Democrats, stop arguing about health care and show leadership. Medicare for All is not a good idea. It\u2019s just an idea. It\u2019s up to the American people, after considering the pros and cons \u2014 which, yes, do include much higher taxes for everyone \u2014 to decide whether, on balance, the trade-offs make it worthwhile or whether something else, like an expanded and fortified Obamacare or a public insurance option, would be better. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, is exactly correct when he says that Americans want choices,\u00a0and that we should trust them to make the right decisions for themselves, for their families \u2014 and for the country. You do that by being straight with them. There are\u00a0many possible paths to beating Donald Trump in 2020, but I can guarantee you that trying to out-spin and out-dodge him is not one of them.

She was center stage in this week's Democratic debate,\u00a0following recent poll numbers that showed her leading the field. Her third-quarter fundraising total\u00a0of $24.6 million\u00a0exceeded former Vice President Joe Biden's and\u00a0put her on par with Sen. Bernie Sanders,\u00a0a top fundraiser this year.

Typical was this Warren response\u00a0at\u00a0Tuesday night's debate: \u201cMy question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax. It's why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d What Warren\u00a0says may not\u00a0be that distinct from other progressives in the 2020 Democratic nomination race, but she built her political stardom as a crusader against corporate malfeasance, and she strikes a particular nerve among those who work in industries she has gone after. In recent weeks, I have talked\u00a0with a dozen senior executive women at top financial services, technology, consumer product and health care companies. They all acknowledged Warren\u2019s formidable talents but expressed the same concerns: They want Warren to stop relentlessly vilifying corporate America. The women I spoke to were all Democrats who had passionately backed and bundled for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama. They dream of a woman president\u00a0and spend time and resources advocating for women\u2019s advancement at work and beyond, and yet,\u00a0they\u00a0are anxious. They particularly worry that Warren\u2019s attacks on industry\u00a0paint everyone with one brush stroke, lumping in hardworking, well-intentioned, often middle-class workers at big companies with bad actors or self-interested multimillionaires. Many corporate executives, especially in tech, finance and the pharmaceutical industry, have concerns about the prospect of Warren as the Democratic nominee, but she will likely need many of these people if she wants to win the general election. The concerns of the left-leaning working women I spoke to reflect both a changing tide in Democratic politics\u00a0and an abiding fear that any big negatives could sink Warren's\u00a0chances in a closely divided country. They fear that if\u00a0offended, big-company employees stay home in 2020, especially women, President Donald Trump\u00a0could win again. Here comes the squad: Bernie Sanders is big winner in Democratic debate, and not all because of his performance Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, running for president in 2012,\u00a0famously said that\u00a0\u201ccorporations are people\u201d and was lambasted for it.\u00a0The fact is, he was right. Large corporations employ millions of Americans at every level of the economic spectrum. The finance and insurance industries\u00a0employ 6.1 million people.\u00a0The pharmaceutical\u00a0industry supports 4.7 million jobs,\u00a0which include manufacturing and other middle-income occupations, and the tech sector is estimated to employ\u00a011.8 million people.\u00a0These include middle-income folks working IT, back offices, retail services and administration. And among those millions are, of course, millions of women who have steadily risen in the corporate ranks over the past 40 years and are paying close attention to this election. And yet\u00a0those women, so essential to a Democratic win in 2020, could stay on the sidelines if they feel attacked or vilified by the nominee. It\u2019s not just people working in targeted industries who may find that Warren\u2019s attacks don\u2019t resonate. There is evidence that the general public does not view companies broadly as bad actors.\u00a0An\u00a0Edelman\u00a0poll released this year found that trust in companies is rising. At the same time, according to the Pew Research Center, trust in government is near historic lows. That trust in business has risen for good reason. Over the past decade, big companies have stepped up to fill voids where government has failed. On everything from paid leave and LGBTQ equity\u00a0to environmental stewardship\u00a0and philanthropy, the banking industry and other large corporations have\u00a0been essential to progress on many issues that candidates like Warren care about. Let's break it down: 5 reasons why Elizabeth Warren has the best chance to beat Donald Trump Should companies be held to account when they pollute, corrupt or break the public trust? Of course. But they also should be given credit where it\u2019s due. Warren has shown a remarkable ability to read the mood and passions of voters, and it has paid off in big ways. But to win the presidency, she might\u00a0need to consider a more inclusive, even nuanced approach. It remains to be seen if she\u2019s willing.

      "content": " White House hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants to impose a massive tax on lobbying activities, creating a new levy that she hopes will nudge some of the nation\u2019s biggest companies and special interest groups toward curtailing federal lobbying. \u201cMy new lobbying tax will make hiring armies of lobbyists significantly more expensive for the largest corporate influencers like Blue Cross Blue Shield, Boeing, and Comcast,\u201d Warren said. \u201cSure, this may mean that some corporations and industry groups will choose to reduce their lobbying expenditures, raising less tax revenue down the road \u2013 but in that case, all the better.\u201d The proposal might face long odds\u00a0\u2014 a seeming longshot in a divided Congress in which both sides of the aisle have deep ties to lobbyists \u2014 \u00a0but it marks Warren\u2019s latest effort to press her case to voters that she\u2019s the candidate most in tune with looking out for working-class\u00a0Americans. It also comes amidst growing angst in tech and financial sectors about her growing popularity in polls Under the the Massachusetts senator's\u00a0legislative proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million per year on lobbying Congress and federal agencies would pay a 35% tax on those expenditures. For every dollar above $1 million spent on lobbying, the rate will increase to 60% \u2013 and for every dollar above $5 million, it would increase to 75%, Warren explained in a Medium post.\u00a0Under data compiled from the Center for Responsive Politics, Warren\u2019s proposal\u00a0would have resulted in companies such as Koch Industries, Pfizer, Boeing, Microsoft, Walmart, and Exxon being subject to the 75% rate for lobbying spending above $5 million in every year over the last decade. Warren\u00a0in March unveiled a plan  that called for regulators to roll back big tech mergers such as Amazon acquiring Whole Foods and Facebook purchasing the messaging platform WhatsApp and Instagram. Warren then\u00a0slammed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Tuesday after The Verge published leaked audio in which he lamented that if Warren were elected president Facebook would find itself caught in a legal battle with U.S. government. \"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" Zuckerberg said in the audio that was among snippets from two meetings held with Facebook employees in July. \"And does that still suck for us? Yeah.\" Big tech clash: Warren hits back at Facebook's Zuckerberg after he criticized her plan to break up big tech More: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders slam Big Tech but their campaigns spend heavily on them She took to Twitter last week to push back against a CNBC report citing anonymous Democratic Wall Street donors who told the financial network they would sit out the election or support Trump in Warren becomes the nominee. \u201cI'm fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cI'm not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don't get to buy this process. I won't back down from fighting for the big, structural change we need.\u201d Warren has steadily climbed in the polls. She hovered in the single-digit percentages in most national and early voting states\u2019 polls early in the year. Two recent polls \u2014 one in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa and a national survey of voters \u2014 found her slightly ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden. Warren says revenue generated by her lobbying tax would be poured into a \u201cLobby Defense Trust Fund\u201d that would be used to reinstate the dormant Office of Technology Assessment and increase the budget for congressional support agencies, such as the Congressional Budget Office. The senator said she\u2019d also push to have revenue used to fund a public advocate\u2019s office tasked with helping Americans \u201cengage with federal agencies and fight for the public interest in the rule-making process.\u201d Warren\u2019s plan also calls for using the money to bolster federal agencies that are being inundated by companies or industries lobbying against a rule. She noted that having such a mechanism would have been helpful during the Obama administration when financial industry lobbyists successfully stymied the Department of Labor\u2019s proposed \u201cfiduciary rule,\u201d which would have limited brokers abilities to put fees and commissions ahead of earning returns for their clients\u2019 retirement accounts. After a public hearing on the rule, the agency received more than 100 comments \u2014including 45 from members of Congress \u2014 that seemed to repeat industry talking points. Under law, agencies much respond to all concerns laid out in the public comments; the Obama Labor Department ended up withdrawing the proposed rule amid the flood of comments. \u201cEvery time a company above the $500,000 threshold spends money lobbying against a rule from a federal agency, the taxes on that spending will go directly to the agency to help it fight back,\u201d Warren wrote of her proposal. \u201cIn 2010, DOL could have used that money to hire more staffers to complete the rule more quickly and intake the flood of industry comments opposing it.\u201d Contributing: Rebecca Morin",

A phone call with Xi on June 18 was stored in the same highly-secured electronic system used to hold the\u00a0phone call with Ukraine\u00a0President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky at the center of a whistleblower complaint\u00a0that has led to an impeachment inquiry against Trump, CNN reported. Earlier Thursday, Trump publicly declared that\u00a0China should investigate Biden. \"By the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\" Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn. Warren was reportedly\u00a0mentioned in the phone call as she was beginning to gain traction in the crowded field of 2020 contenders, often emerging as a front-runner along with Biden in polling. \u201cTrump can say what he wants about me, but it's outrageous that any president would sell out the people of Hong Kong behind closed doors,\u201d Warren wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe public must see the transcript of Trump's call with Xi. And we need a leader who will stand up for our values.\u201d According to CNN, \"In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on\u00a0Hong Kong protests\u00a0as trade talks progressed.\" Biden responded on Twitter after Trump first mentioned China, accusing him of attempting to\u00a0\"rig the primary and pick your opponent,\" adding that the president\u00a0\"cannot extort foreign governments\" in his effort to win reelection. \"It\u2019s an abuse of power.

      "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has taken over the top spot in several recent national presidential primary polls as candidates prepare to debate\u00a0Oct. 15. Most national polls since the end of September have found Warren \u2013 not former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0\u2013\u00a0leading the pack, but by relatively narrow margins. Biden had led in almost every national poll, usually by double digits,\u00a0going back to 2018. But Warren has come out on top in four of the past five\u00a0and six of\u00a0the past 10. And she recently pulled ahead in the RealClearPolitics average, a frequently cited polling benchmark. Though she is in front of Biden only by 0.2%, it marks the first time Biden has not held the lead in the race's RCP average since the site began comparing\u00a0the polls\u00a0in December. The most recent poll to place her at the top was released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University. That poll found her ahead of Biden 29%-26%. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont came in third at 16%. Among those who described themselves as \"very liberal,\" Warren led Biden 38%-26%, and among the \"somewhat\" liberals she led 37%-23%. Biden led among moderate and conservative Democrats 35%-22%. Democratic primary: Elizabeth Warren is on the rise and so is the criticism from her Democratic rivals \"Warren maintains her strength in the Democratic primary, which has been consistently growing since the start of her campaign. This poll confirms her status as a co-frontrunner with Biden,\"\u00a0said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy. The poll found that Warren held narrow leads with both men and women\u00a0and that she had a 12-percentage-point lead with white voters. Biden was favored by black voters 36%-20% and by voters over 65 by a 41%-26% margin. The survey was conducted  Oct.\u00a04-7 from among 1,483 self-identified registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus\u00a03.1%. Warren also has performed well in the early primary states that can be key to securing the nomination. Last month, a\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found her leading in the\u00a0first-in-the-nation caucus state, and a Monmouth University poll put her narrowly ahead of Biden in New Hampshire.\u00a0A\u00a0 Suffolk\u00a0University/USA TODAY Network Poll released on Sept. 24 placed her just 4 points behind Biden in Nevada, the third state where primary voters will cast their ballots. Elizabeth Warren: Elizabeth Warren leads Iowa Poll for the first time, besting Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders Biden maintains a comfortable 41%-12% lead over Warren in South Carolina, the fourth state on the primary calendar, according to a recent Fox News poll. The former vice president's\u00a0drop in the polls comes as President Donald Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have mounted a public campaign accusing Biden of impropriety in Ukraine during his time in office. Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine to dig deeper into the matter has sparked an impeachment inquiry. Warren\u2019s latest hurdle to the presidency: Democrats' belief women face tougher fight against Trump Tuesday's poll from\u00a0Quinnipiac shows that voters approve of the impeachment inquiry 53%-43%\u00a0and that 45% think Trump should be removed from office while 49% do not. The margin had been 37%-57% in a Quinnipiac poll before the inquiry launched. Only 34% said they approved of the way Trump has responded to the impeachment inquiry, compared with 57% who disapproved. But 43% agreed with the president that it was a \"political witch hunt,\" while 51% said it was a \"legitimate investigation.\" Though Trump has said\u00a0his effort to push Ukraine to investigate Biden was motivated by a desire to battle corruption rather than taint a political opponent, only 33% of voters bought that explanation, and 48% said he was out to hurt a rival. Twenty percent weren't yet certain or thought both reasons were true. Polls have consistently found that Democratic voters care more about picking a candidate in 2020 who can defeat Trump than any particular policy issue. When asked whom they would vote for if the election was held today,\u00a0Quinnipiac found that both Warren and Biden would beat the incumbent president\u00a0\u2013 Biden by a margin of 51%-40% and Warren by a margin of 49%-41%. Trump indirectly acknowledged Warren's rise in the polls in a tweet Tuesday in which he called on his 2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton to \"enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.\" Speaking to House Republicans in Baltimore last month, Trump said\u00a0Warren had \"emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she can beat Sleepy Joe (Biden).\" \"He has no idea what\u2019s going on,\" Trump said.

      "content": " One story that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has repeatedly told on the 2020 campaign trail is about how she was let go from her first teaching job when she was 22, after school officials realized she was pregnant. But now Warren is on the defense with her account after an interview\u00a0from over a decade ago resurfaced in which she\u00a0described\u00a0the circumstances around her departure from the school district in a different way, and conservative outlets acquired\u00a0meeting notes from the school board of the time showing that her contract was extended. The Democratic presidential hopeful is now using her circumstance to highlight the stories of other women in the United States who have faced gender-based\u00a0discrimination. \"We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours,\" Warren said in a tweet on Tuesday. Warren's story goes like this: In 1971, she was offered an extra year to her contract after completing her first year as a teacher, before the school knew that she was pregnant. But after a couple months, once her pregnancy became obvious, \"The principal did what principals did in those days\u2014wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.\" This all occurred before pregnancy discrimination was outlawed by Congress in 1978. More: Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in recent Democratic presidential primary polls In an interview\u00a0from 2007, Warren said\u00a0that she left her job and stayed home with her new family. \"I actually didn't have the education courses, so I was on an emergency certificate, it was called, and I\u00a0went back to graduate school and took a couple courses in education, and said 'I don't think this is going to work out for me,'\" she said. \"And I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years, and I Was really casting about thinking, 'What am I going to do?'\" In a statement to\u00a0CBS News, Warren attempted to clarify\u00a0the discrepancy. \"After becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life and this was one of them. I wrote about it in my book when I became a U.S. Senator,\"\u00a0she said. The school board meeting notes, which CBS also reviewed, include mention of her resignation. Conservatives have latched on to the changes in her account as yet another example of a \"made up\" story,\u00a0along with the now infamous\u00a0claim\u00a0to Native American ancestry. \"What you have here is a pattern of someone who's been successful\u2014and by the way she has been successful, she's a U.S. senator\u2014but rather than say, 'I've been successful,' she has claimed repeatedly to be the victim of discrimination,\" said Fox News' Tucker Carlson. But many women have come forward with their stories of pregnancy and gender discrimination to show that they believe Warren. \"I think of how this resonates with so many millions of women across this country and people who have been in, if not that exact\u00a0situation, similar situations,\" Warren told CBS.

      "content": "    Twelve\u00a0Democratic presidential candidates sparred\u00a0Tuesday over healthcare, guns and other issues at a debate in Westerville, Ohio. Here's a play-by-play of the event: 11 p.m. EDT Welcome to the lead, Elizabeth Warren. Throughout a feisty three-hour Democratic debate in Ohio on Tuesday, the Massachusetts senator, who has risen to frontrunner status in recent polls, drew sharp and repeated attacks from other candidates on how to pay for health care, whether to tax the wealthy and what has caused the erosion of American middle class jobs. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea,\u201d Amy Klobuchar said at one point as she turned to Warren during an exchange over taxing billionaires. The sixth debate night of the 2020 presidential election cycle came during an inflection point in the race, as Joe Biden\u2019s longstanding status as the frontrunner has been battered by Warren\u2019s momentum. A common and telling refrain from the moderators throughout the debate: \u201cI want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond.\u201d The piling on began almost immediately, on the issue of health care. After five debates in which health care has been a top issue, the candidates drew sharper battle lines over how they would pay a Medicare-for-All system that has divided the field. Warren once again declined to say explicitly whether more government involvement in health care under Medicare for All would require Americans to pay more in taxes. \u201cSo let me be clear on this,\u201d Warren said. \u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down.\u201d Pete Buttigieg jumped, noting the lack of concrete response. \u201cWell, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,\u201d he said in response to Warren. \u201cLook, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.\u201d Bernie Sanders acknowledged that taxes would go up but said that families would save more than enough money in their health insurance plans to make up for it. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d Klobuchar said at one point. \u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d It was a frontrunner\u2019s debate, with Warren and Biden getting far more airtime than the other candidates on stage. The two had one of their first extended scuffles over a fundamental rift in the field: Whether the nominee should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering to a progressive wing that\u00a0wants major change, versus the more pragmatic approach favored by Biden and others on stage. President Donald Trump remained a central theme throughout the debate. Democrats were unified in their support of the impeachment inquiry launched this month by House Democrats. On the other hand, the flap over Joe Biden\u2019s son \u2013 Hunter Biden \u2013 and his business ties to Ukraine was addressed quickly in the debate and then dispensed with. Biden said his son \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d and that his interview on ABC earlier Tuesday \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d Other Democrats on stage did not seek to attack Biden over the issue. Quite the contrary, in fact. \u201cThat was so offensive,\" Cory Booker said of Biden having to answer a question on his son\u2019s foreign business. Another theme in the debate was criticism of Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, which\u00a0cleared\u00a0the way for Turkey to invade and battle with U.S.-allied Kurds. The Democratic candidates largely agreed that Trump\u2019s decision was a betrayal of the Kurds, but they disagreed on what to do next. Biden indicated that he would maintain a troop presence in the region. \u201cI would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being \u2013 having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they're not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds,\u201d Biden said. The debate about what to do in Syria drew in others into a clash on stage. \u201cSo really what you\u2019re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d Eight of the candidates on stage Tuesday had already qualified for the next debate \u2013 to be held Nov. 20 near Atlanta. That meant fewer of the lesser-known candidates this time around needed a breakout moment to stay alive. But the Iowa caucuses are fast approaching, and the window for moving from \u201cstaying alive\u201d to potentially clinching the nomination is narrowing. Four candidates who were on stage Tuesday aren\u2019t yet a lock for November: Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard, Julian Castro and Beto O\u2019Rourke. \u2013 John Fritze, Maureen Groppe, Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 10:47 p.m. EDT In one of the more tense moments in the debate, Joe Biden sparred with Elizabeth Warren over how to get things done in Washington. The back-and-forth came during a debate over whether Democrats should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering liberal elements of the party that want major structure change, versus Biden\u2019s more pragmatic approach and argument that the party should not overreach. To underscore her argument that Democrats should pursue bold ideas, Warren touted her role in setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 after the Great Recession and 2007-2009 financial crisis. The effort required a big fight. Republicans bitterly opposed the idea, viewing it as government overreach. \u201cI went on the floor and got you votes,\u201d a visibly upset Biden told Warren. \u201cI got you votes.\u201d Warren looked past Biden\u2019s remarks and instead thanked his former boss, President Barack Obama. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama for fighting so hard,\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou did a hell of job in your job,\u201d Biden acknowledged. \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren said. \u2013 John Fritze, Maureen Groppe, Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 10:40 p.m. EDT Democrats name check ... Robert Bork? The most unusual name check of Democratic debate night: The late conservative jurist Robert Bork. Cory Booker first invoked his name in mocking proposals to enforce antitrust law, saying that\u00a0\"Robert Bork is just laughing in his sleep.\" Numerous commentators pointed out an inconvenient fact. \"Bork has been dead for six years. He\u2019s more than asleep,\" tweeted political writer Walter Shapiro. (Bork actually died in December of 2012, almost seven years ago.) Political scientist Jack Pitney invoked the words of writer Raymond Chandler:\u00a0\u201cYou were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that, oil and water were the same as wind and air to you.\u201d Later in the debate, Joe Biden also jumped on the Bork bandwagon. Biden noted that, in 1987, he led the Senate effort to reject Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, a pivotal event in the hyper-partisanship that has marked so many judicial nominations. \u2013 David Jackson 10:29 p.m. EDT In the middle of his criticism of big corporations, Cory Booker playfully chided the moderators for asking older candidates \u2013 Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 about their health. \u201cI feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage,\u201d the New Jersey senator said. \u201cIt\u2019s rich to me that we asked three people about their health when, looking at this stage, we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.\u201d In February, after Trump took his annual physical exam, then White House press secrer Sarah Sanders said Trump is \u201cin very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond.\u201d A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019 physical health. \u2013 Ledyard King 10:15 p.m. EDT When pressed about whether he\u2019s \u201cup to the stress\u201d of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month, Sen. Bernie Sanders responded, \u201cI\u2019m healthy. I\u2019m feeling great.\u201d The 78-year-old canceled several campaign events after undergoing surgery, releasing a video in which he said lying in a Las Vegas hospital \u201cmade me feel even more strongly the need for us to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system.\u201d But as the Vermont senator seeks\u00a0to turn his heart attack into a conversation about Medicare for All,\u00a0the scare has renewed questions about whether his age will affect his stamina in the race and in the White House should he win in 2020. A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate\u2019 physical health. Sanders said he\u2019s reassuring Americans about his fitness by \u201cmounting a vigorous campaign\u201d across the country and he plugged a rally in Queens he is planning on Saturday. The Vermont senator also drew cheers after he thanked his supporters and those who sent prayers and well wishes for his recovery. The same question was put to another septuagenarian \u2013\u00a0Joe Biden, who would be 78 if elected to office. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience \u2013 with it comes wisdom,\u201d Biden said. 9:55 p.m. EDT Beto O\u2019Rourke and Pete Buttigieg got into an extended personal debate in a continuation of an argument they\u2019ve been having over O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal to require people to give up assault-style weapons. Asked how he would enforce a mandatory buyback program, O\u2019Rourke said he expects \u201cmy fellow Americans to follow the law.\u201d Buttigieg, who has called O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal a \u201cshiny object\u201d that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support, said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s response makes clear that he doesn\u2019t know how the plan would work. \u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they\u2019re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups. Buttigieg said the problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cEveryone on this stage is determined to get something done.\u201d O\u2019Rourke then said Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cshiny object\u201d description of the buyback plan was a slap in the face to every survivor of a mass shooting. Buttigieg responded that the best response for gun shooting survivors is to \u201cactually deliver a solution.\u201d Amy Klobuchar echoed Buttigieg\u2019s criticism when asked what\u2019s wrong with a mandatory buyback program. \u201cI just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s not mess this up with this fight.\u201d Kamala Harris, when\u00a0asked why she supports a mandatory buyback program, replied by saying there are 5 million assault weapons are on the streets. \u201cI have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims that I care to tell you,\u201d the former prosecutor\u00a0said. \u201cI\u2019m done and we need action.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 9:46 p.m. EDT It\u2019s hard to make the argument on why voters should support you when you don\u2019t get much of a chance to talk. While Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg got most of the air time, Andrew Yang, Julian Castro, Cory Booker and new-to-the-stage Tom Steyer are having a harder time making their case. According to a word count of the first hour of the debate, candidates at the top of the poll led the scramble for air time Warren dominated speaking times for the first parts of the debate, based on a USA TODAY analysis of preliminary transcripts. She spoke about 1,251 words during the first two parts of the debate, followed by Biden, who spoke 668 words. Buttigieg had the third-most speaking time, at 658 words. On the other end, Beto O\u2019Rourke (190 words) Tulsi Gabbard (157 words), and businessman Tom Steyer had the least speaking time so far, with about 140 words. \u2013 Ledyard King and Nicholas Wu 9:42 p.m. EDT Elizabeth Warren used the debate to make a statement about the Middle East that is sure to get some attention in coming days as the Democrats clashed on stage over how to respond to the ongoing conflict in Syria. \"I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East,\" Warren said during a discussion of Turkey's invasion of northern Syria. \"I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.\" Commentators on social media clamored for Warren to be more specific. \"Warren is making big news when she says we should have no troops in the Middle East,\" tweeted Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton. \"We have important bases all over the region that are important to our national security.\u201d Warren\u2019s comments came during an extended debate how to proceed in the region. Democrats largely agree that President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria was an abandonment of U.S.-allied Kurds, but they disagreed somewhat on what to do next. \u201cSo really what you\u2019re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d Gabbard and Buttigieg are the only two Democrats on stage who served in uniform. \u2013 David Jackson and John Fritze 9:38 p.m. EDT Steyer: Trump\u2019s America First \u2018worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard\u2019 Tom Steyer, who has spent millions trying to combat climate change, made it clear how little he thinks of President Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d platform that champions the massive development and expansion of carbon-causing fossil fuels to power the U.S. economy. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve the climate crisis by ourselves,\u201d the one-time California hedge fund billionaire said. \u201cWe have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the word.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to lead the world morally,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to lead it technologically, financially and commercially. This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard, and I would change it one day one in every single way.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King 9:29 p.m. EDT Kamala Harris got in one of her signature lines on Donald Trump while criticizing his foreign policy. Harris said Trump has given 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card, calling what\u2019s happening in Syria a crisis of Trump\u2019s own making. And he has a long list of those, she added. \u201cThat\u2019s why Dude gotta go,\u201d Harris said. 9:27 p.m. EDT Joe Biden came out swinging on Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria but declined to answer a direct\u00a0question: Would he, as president, place special forces troops back in the region? Biden called Trump\u2019s decision the \u201cmost shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,\u201d as he excoriated the president for clearing the way for Turkey to attack U.S. allied Kurds in Syria. Biden said he believed the U.S. should be involved in air support, but declined to say whether he would order troops back. The issue is a complicated one for Democrats, many of whom have criticized Trump\u2019s move in Syria but who have also called for the U.S. to withdraw from entanglements in the Middle East. Trump has defended the move by saying he wants to extract American soldiers from overseas commitment. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg. \u2013 John Fritze and David Jackson 9:08 p.m. EDT In the first debates, Joe Biden who led the polls was the target of rivals\u2019 slings and arrows. On Tuesday, riding polls that show her now on top, Elizabeth Warren discovered that she\u2019s wearing the bullseye. On health care, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden took turns hitting Warren on her Medicare For All\u00a0plan that they said was costly and unrealistic. On wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her \u201dultra-millionaire tax\u201d as the best plan. \u201cWe just have different approaches,\u201d Klobuchar told Warren. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke piled on: \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the solution but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up and sometimes I think Sen. Warren is focused on being punitive or pitting one side of the country against the other.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King and Courtney Subramanian 9 p.m. EDT Democrats on stage largely agreed on at least one thing: Tax the rich. Even the rich agreed. Bernie Sanders took a question directly in his wheelhouse: Does he believe the billionaires should be taxed out of existence? Sanders didn\u2019t go that far, but he did say that the country could not \u201cafford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality.\u201d Tom Steyer, a philanthropist and longtime Democratic donor making his first appearance on the presidential debate stage, said he largely agreed with Sanders\u2019 assessment. \u201cSanders is right,\u201d Steyer said during an extended debate about whether the candidates supported a wealth tax. \u201cThere have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government.\u201d Amy Klobuchar captured the sense of the debate a minute later: \u201cNot even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d \u2013 John Fritze 8:53 p.m. EDT Bernie Sanders' support of the Green New deal and its guarantee of federal work for millions of Americans didn\u2019t sit well with businessman Andrew Yang, whose signature campaign proposal would give Americans\u00a0a $1,000 monthly \u201cdividend.\u201d Yang said he likes the \u201cspirit\u201d of a federal jobs guarantee, which Sanders said is needed with the onset of automation. But \u201cthe fact is most Americans don\u2019t want to work for the federal government,\u201d Yang said. \u201cAnd saying that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most American would embrace.\u201d Yang said he\u2019s rather put money directly in American\u2019s pocket\u00a0than rely on government to address the problem because \u201cit will result in failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants.\u201d \u2013 Ledyard King 8:51 p.m. EDT Senator Kamala Harris was asked to weigh in on the back-and-forth over Medicare for All and instead turned the conversation to abortion rights. \u201cThere are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare,\u201d she said. She said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color \u201cwill die\u201d because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being \u201cout of touch\u201d with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights. \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 8:37 p.m. EDT Elizabeth Warren, the candidate who boasts that she has a plan for everything, was pushed on why she hasn\u2019t said how she would pay for expanding health are to all Americans. Bernie Sanders, who like Warren supports Medicare for All,\u00a0has acknowledged that taxes would need to go up to pay for it, but has said premiums would go down. Asked whether her plan would require higher taxes on the middle class, Warren said costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations but down for middle class families. \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.\u201d Warren said. Buttigieg, who has criticized Warren on the issue, said she dodged the question \u2013 what he called an example of why people are \u201cso frustrated with Washington.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage for everyone is by obliterating private plans,\u201d Buttigieg said. Warren said Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d proposal is really \u201cMedicare for All Who Can Afford It.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the problem we\u2019ve got,\u201d she said. \u201cMedicare for All is the gold standard.\u201d Amy Klobuchar, another contender trying to distinguish herself by warning that the more liberal candidates are going too\u00a0far, said Warren was handing Republicans a gift by offering up a plan they can attack as too expensive.\u200b \u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice,\" Klobuchar said. \"The difference between a plan and a pipe dream, is something that you can actually get done,\" she said. Joe Biden argued that taxes increases for some would exceed what they would save on health care costs. \"The issues is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry,\u201d Sanders shot back. \u2013 Maureen Groppe and Courtney Subramanian 8:23 p.m. EDT Everyone knew the question was coming: Why was it okay for Hunter Biden to have a business interest in Ukraine when, as vice president, Joe Biden was the Obama administration\u2019s lead on that country? Biden largely demurred on the question. \u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment (Hunter) he made.\u201d The question had been guaranteed to come up early in this debate, the first since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry and the Trump campaign began firing back with television ads highlighting Hunter Biden\u2019s former business dealings in the Ukraine and China. Hunter Biden hours earlier acknowledged he made a \"mistake\" and showed \u201cpoor judgement\u201d in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. Speaking to ABC News, Hunter Biden denied doing anything \"improper\" in the Ukraine. Some Democrats saw the flap as a chance for Joe Biden to hit back at Trump, including by noting that Trump\u2019s children also have overseas business tied to Donald Trump\u2019s real estate empire. The former vice president didn't raise the issue. \u2013 John Fritze 8:20 p.m. EDT Steyer pushes his signature issue: impeachment Billionaire Tom Steyer, who launched his campaign in July, has long pushed for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment before the formal inquiry began and made that his first point in his debut on the Democratic debate stage tonight. Before calling every candidate on the stage more patriotic than the president, Steyer pointed out he launched the Need to Impeach, an online campaign focused on Trump\u2019s impeachment in October 2017, two years before House Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s interactions with Ukraine. \u201cImpeaching and removing the president is something the American people are demanding,\u201d he said. \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 8:17 p.m. EDT President Donald Trump has faced considerable blowback for his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria this month, a move that all but paved the way for Turkey to begin airstrikes against U.S.-allied Kurds. It didn\u2019t take long for that issue to pop up at the Democratic debate. Amy Klobuchar raised it in the answer to her first question, tying it to a question about whether the president should be impeached and removed from office. Klobuchar asked how \"leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter\" would make \"Make America Great Again.\" Look for this issue to come up a lot more over the next three hours. \u2013 John Fritze 8:11 p.m. EDT The debate launched with a question about House Democrat\u2019s impeachment inquiry, which all the Democratic presidential candidates support. But with a presidential election year coming up, why shouldn\u2019t voters determine whether Trump stays in office, Elizabeth Warren was asked. \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d she said. Up next, Bernie Sanders called Trump the most corrupt president in history. \u201cI agree with Bernie,\u201d Joe Biden echoed. Because the White House has refused to cooperate with Democrats\u2019 investigation, Biden added, Congress has no choice but to act. Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long. \u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 8 p.m. EDT The latest debate of the Democratic presidential primary is underway in Ohio. With the impeachment inquiry in full swing, fighting along the Syria-Turkey border, Bernie Sanders\u2019 recent health trouble and questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the Ukraine, the moderators of the three-hour CNN/New York Times debate will have plenty to ask about. Stay tuned here (and hit refresh often) for up-to-minute developments. \u2013 John Fritze 7:50 p.m. EDT Democrats will be on the debate stage Tuesday, but President Donald Trump's campaign is still looming large. The Trump campaign, campaign committees, and the Republican National Committee announced a $125.7 million fundraising haul for the third Federal Elections Commission filing quarter as Democrats prepared to take the stage for the fourth Democratic presidential debate. In a release, the campaign said all of the groups would have $158 million cash on hand. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s campaign is a juggernaut on an unstoppable path to victory in November 2020,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said. According to the Trump campaign, it received 1,056,126 individual donations last quarter, with an average donation of $44.50. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., raised about $25 million last quarter, the most out of any of the Democratic contenders. \u2013 Nicholas Wu 7:40 p.m. EDT Expect sharper elbows from South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has already\u00a0called out Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this week while trading barbs with former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke. The Indiana mayor launched a digital ad Monday explicitly attacking Sanders and Warren for their support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and instead touting his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d plan. Earlier this week, Buttigieg faced off with former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke over a mandatory buyback program for assault rifles, a policy O\u2019Rourke made headlines over in the last debate. Earlier this month O\u2019Rourke slammed Buttigieg for his hesitancy over support for the program. The mayor responded to the criticism earlier this week in an interview with Snapchat\u2019s \u201cGood Luck America.\u201d \u201cI get it. He needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant,\u201d Buttigieg said Monday. O\u2019Rourke responded in a tweet: \u201cPete can belittle the grassroots; he can call buybacks a \u2018shiny object.\u2019 He can say whatever he wants, but guns kill 40,000 people year.\u201d \u2013 Courtney Subramanian 7:15 p.m. EDT The dozen Democrats on the debate stage in Ohio will have to answer a boatload of uncomfortable questions Tuesday about health issues, the age of the field's frontrunners and foreign entanglements in the Ukraine \u2013 to name a few. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just threw another touchy issue into the queue: Should the House hold a vote to formalize the impeachment\u00a0Democrats announced at a press conference three weeks ago?\u00a0Less than two hours before the debate got underway, Pelosi announced that he House would hold off on that vote for now. Republicans have noted that every previous impeachment inquiry was preceded with a vote in the House to set up a special committee to conduct the investigation. Democrats say they don\u2019t need to do that \u2013 and the Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly require it \u2013 but Republicans have raised process questions to hammer away at the inquiry and the White House has said it won\u2019t provide documents absent a vote. \u2013 John Fritze 7:05 p.m. EDT President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016 by 8 points, rebranding a state long seen a presidential battleground into one that is older, whiter and more Republican. When\u00a0Trump won the state it raised questions about Ohio's ability to mirror the national mood, according to Kyle Kondik, author of \"The Bellwether.\" By holding their debate Otterbein University outside of Columbus, Democrats are signaling they\u2019re not conceding the state. \"I am absolutely confident that battleground Ohio will once again be in Democratic hands,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez told reporters from state and national news organizations. Democrats see hope in the suburbs, which have swung their way. That\u2019s why Tuesday night\u2019s debate will take place in an Ohio suburb that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 but switched to Hillary Clinton in 2016. The reason Ohio has become much more Republican relative to the nation? It's significantly whiter with a smaller share of college graduates than average.\u00a0That\u2019s not the case in Westerville, however, the town where the debate is being held. So unless Democrats can improve their standing with white voters without four-year college degrees, they'll have a hard time carrying Ohio in 2020, Kondik concludes in an analysis for the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. -- Cincinnati Enquirer, Maureen Groppe, Maureen\u00a0and John Fritze 7 p.m. EDT Is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg still considering a run for president? Based on an op-ed published hours before the debate Tuesday in the Washington Post, it sure looks like he\u2019s eager to remain in the mix. Bloomberg\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who initially announced he wouldn\u2019t run but who more recently has reportedly told allies he\u2019d consider it if Biden falters \u2013 writes that the current field of candidates is talking about the wrong things. \u201cRarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,\u201d said Bloomberg, who is known for overseeing a technocratic administration that came on the heels of another former New York leader who\u2019s been in the news a lot lately: Rudy Giuliani. \u201cThe job\u2019s essential skills primarily involve leadership and management, not policy analysis,\u201d Bloomberg writes. \u201cThe country elects a commander in chief, and yet based on the campaign so far, one might think we are electing a legislator in chief.\u201d Bloomberg also uses the piece to take a swipe at Trump. Bloomberg says he spoke with the president shortly after the 2016 election and advised him to hire people \u201cwho are smarter than you.\u201d So how did Trump do? A few good hires, Bloomberg opines, otherwise not very well. \u201cMostly he hired cronies, ideologues and sycophants,\u201d Bloomberg wrote, \u201cwhile also leaving hundreds of important senior level positions unfilled and paying less attention to many agencies than he does to cable TV news.\u201d \u2013 John Fritze 6:50 p.m. EDT Betting sites are taking all kinds of wagers on tonight\u2019s debate, including on whether Bernie Sanders will withdraw from the race, whether anyone will curse on stage, who will be tweeted about most, and how many times certain words will be said. Can you rank these words by the frequency in which SportsBetting.ag thinks they will be uttered? Billionaire. Impeach. China. Obama (as mentioned by Biden). If you guessed China, impeach, billionaire and then Biden references to Obama, you\u2019re thinking like a bookie. (The over/under on the China mentions is 40.5 and the over/under on Biden references to Obama is 3.5.) \u2013 Maureen Groppe 6:45 p.m. EDT A growing battle between Pete Buttigieg and the party\u2019s progressive wing escalated in the lead-up to the debate. Buttigieg released a new digital ad drawing a distinction between his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d health care plan and the proposal backed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The ad says Sanders and Warren \u201cbelieve that we have to force ourselves into `Medicare for all,\u2019 where private insurance is abolished.\u201d The ad is running in Iowa where a new poll from Firehouse Strategies has Buttigieg in third place, having moved ahead of Sanders. Buttigieg\u2019s increased attempts to go after the frontrunners include this comment he made Monday about Warren\u2019s eschewing small donor strategy: \u201cWe're not going to beat Trump with pocket change.\u201d In a tweeted response, Progressive icon Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the grassroots campaigning that Buttigieg \u201cinsults\u201d has outraised him. And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee boasted that \u201cnumerous progressive voices sent warning flares to Mayor Pete before Tuesday's debate.\u201d \u201cMayor Pete has been a rising star. But he needs to stop this,\u201d the political action committee wrote in a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday. 6:40 p.m. EDT The Trump campaign\u2019s response to the Democratic debate can be summed up in one word: socialism. In a full-page ad in today\u2019s Columbus Dispatch the campaign argues that Democrats\u2019 \u201cbig government socialism will wreck Ohio\u2019s economy.\u201d Banners scheduled to fly above the city of Westerville during the afternoon shouted \u201cSOCIALISM DESTROYS OHIO JOBS.\u201d The campaign says Democrats would raise taxes, eliminate private health insurance and increasing electrical bills by \u201cending fossil fuels.\u201d \u2013 Maureen Groppe 5:50 p.m. EDT The Westerville\u00a0debate is the first since\u00a0House\u00a0Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump last month over the Ukraine scandal. Joe Biden will have a chance to push back forcefully on the president's efforts to get officials in Ukraine to investigate him and his son, Hunter. But Biden also may face\u00a0questions about the appropriateness of his son's having served on \u00a0the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0will take the stage\u00a0two weeks after having a heart attack. And Elizabeth Warren has been making a strong case\u00a0\u2013\u00a0through fundraising, organizing and poll numbers\u00a0\u2013 for why she should be considered the frontrunner. Still, Biden will stand in the center of the stage, flanked by Warren and Sanders, based on the average of the 10 most recent qualifying polls as of Oct. 2. October Democratic debate: Will Sanders attend? What are the issues? Here are 4 things you need to know The nine other candidates on stage will make the debate the largest presidential primary debate in the nation's recorded history, according to the New York Times. They will have three hours, in snippets of 75 seconds or less, to make their case to the voters. \u2013 Maureen Groppe On stage for the first time will be billionaire Tom Steyer who has pumped millions of dollars into a campaign to impeach Trump. A half dozen Democrats still in the race didn't make tonight's cut, including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, the only remaining governor running, and self-help author Marianne Williamson. The polling numbers and fundraising support required to participate will ratchet up further for the November debate. Impeachment: 5 ways the Trump impeachment inquiry will loom large at Tuesday's Democratic debate \u2013 Maureen Groppe Joe Biden told supporters at a California fundraiser last week that he's had a target on his back at the debates because he began\u00a0the race as a frontrunner. He's facing competition for his frontrunner status, though. Elizabeth Warren has been climbing in the polls. In some surveys, she polls slightly higher than him while in others Biden maintains an edge. Biden also enters the debate facing questions about how well he's handled the Ukrainian controversy and having just been outraised by three of his opponents in the last quarter. Plus, in an interview that aired Tuesday morning, Hunter Biden\u00a0repeatedly admitted\u00a0he made a \"mistake\" in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. So should we expect a different Biden from the last three rounds? \u201cOne of the problems I\u2019m finding, I\u2019ve got to be more aggressive,\u201d Biden said at the fundraiser.\u00a0\u201cWhich is good, I\u2019m not complaining, I\u2019m a big boy,\u201d he said, while explaining that the debates' time restraints don\u2019t allow time for full answers. \u2013 Maureen Groppe While debates offer a chance for contenders to stand out by attacking an opponent, that can be difficult to do while remaining likable. And a poll out Tuesday underscores why Democrats need to stay in good graces with voters. The latest findings from the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Battleground Poll show Trump isn\u2019t the only one who has a higher unfavorability than favorability rating. For six of the seven Democratic hopefuls tested, more voters had a negative opinion than a positive one. The exception was Pete Buttigieg, but 39% of respondents had no opinion of him or had never heard of him. \u2013 Maureen Groppe Contributing: Nicholas Wu",

      "content": " I know this seems wild. But it's true: I'm 44, and within my lifetime, it was legal to fire women because they were pregnant. It's difficult to imagine.\u00a0But a few short decades ago, it was an unquestioned reality that pregnant women didn't belong at work, a conjunction of cultural norms\u00a0that strictly defined women's priorities as domestic, regardless of the circumstances of that woman's life. And in some workplaces, because of\u00a0even harder-to-understand ideas about sex. My mother is 87, and she taught school in the 1950s, one of few professional options for women who wanted or needed to work.\u00a0At the schools where my mother taught, she told me, it was simply understood that you wouldn't be able to keep teaching while pregnant, and the same norms applied in other professions. Why are we talking about this now? Because some media reports have questioned\u00a0a story Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0Elizabeth Warren tells on the campaign trail, about being \"shown the door\" at her first teaching job in 1971\u00a0after becoming pregnant with her first child. Some outlets have dug\u00a0up school board meeting minutes that show Warren's contract was extended (Warren says that happened before she revealed her pregnancy),\u00a0and a politely phrased district announcement of her departure as evidence that this story just can't be true. Policies make some choices easier:: I shouldn't have had to fight to be a stay-at-home mom. We need family-friendly policies. But that's kind of the point, my mother said. Firing a pregnant woman wasn't an extreme or objectionable act. \"They didn\u2019t want pregnant women in the classroom,\" she said. For\u00a0folks who lived through this era, that was as clear as it was unremarkable. \"When someone suddenly was missing during the school year, or the word came out that this year that so-and-so wouldn\u2019t be back,\u00a0it was because she was pregnant,\" my mother said. \"I\u2019m quite sure they didn\u2019t say 'Now that you\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re being fired.'\" Things hadn't changed much by 1971. \"In the late 1960s and 1970s, you\u00a0have all this legislation pouring out that\u2019s trying to address political equality, social equality, economic equality, but you still haven\u2019t dislodged all these unwritten norms that try to nudge people into behaving in a certain way,\" said Janine Lanza, an associate professor of history at Wayne State University. And most of these norms were\u00a0aimed at constraining the agency women could exercise, whether in the workplace or with regard to their own sexuality. Treatment is out of reach for most: As a new mom, postpartum depression made the most wonderful time of my life also the worst \"They didn\u2019t have to write it down. It would be a very clear subtext of this conversation that if she was pregnant, her place was to be at home with the child, and not in the workplace. That was the assumption.\" Women's connection to work was presumed to be tenuous, Lanza said, and secondary to their responsibilities to their husbands and families. \"It was this idea that\u00a0men belong in public space, and women belong in private space,\" she said. There was also, my mother said, a weird sex thing. Unmarried women who had obvious sexual relationships faced steep social and economic penalties. But it was also dicey for married women, particularly women who taught young children, during\u00a0an era in which most couples on television were shown sleeping in separate beds, and a ground-breaking episode of \"I Love Lucy\" written to accommodate star Lucille Ball's second pregnancy couldn't use the word \"pregnant,\" considered too vulgar for the airwaves. \"Pregnancy would have brought up the question of sex, and at that point there were no sex ed classes, none of that,\" my mother said. \"They didn\u2019t want married women flaunting their marriages by being pregnant. They really didn\u2019t want the word 'sex'\u00a0ever mentioned. \"It was weird.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t as horrible as the Victorian age. But there were a lot of holdovers.\" After the U.S. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act\u00a0in 1978, women who had lost or were at risk of losing a job\u00a0because of pregnancy had some legal resource. In a way, I suppose it's good that things have changed so much\u00a0\u2014 that an absolute fact of life for women a half-century ago is so outrageous now that we struggle to grasp it. But it's also true that in some ways, we're still laboring under the assumption that men belong in public life, and that women are there on tolerance. That's why female candidates like Warren have to defend their own stories. And why it's so important not to let the bad old days fade from memory.

      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has been in a feud with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and now she's using his own platform against him with a new ad\u00a0calling out the Facebook policy against fact-checking politicians. \"Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,\" the ad begins. \"You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?'\" it continues. \"Well it's not. (Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Trump free rein to lie on his platform -- and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\" Warren is referring\u00a0to a Facebook advertising policy that allows for politicians to present false or misleading information in ads due to the belief that any statement from a political figure is important to the public interest. Facebook ads, in general, are subject to a third-party fact-checking system. Ads with claims debunked by the fact-checkers are prohibited. Facebook says that ads are reviewed prior to being made public. Politicians, however, are exempt from that fact-checking program. A senior Facebook official explained that policy in a speech last month. \"We rely on third-party fact-checkers to help reduce the spread of false news and other types of viral misinformation, like memes or manipulated photos and videos,\" Vice President of Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg said. \"We don\u2019t believe, however, that it\u2019s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician\u2019s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny,\" Clegg added. Rather, Facebook \"demotes\" politician-generated ad content that has previously been determined false. The politician advertising policy has\u00a0come under recent scrutiny because of a Trump campaign ad featuring claims about former Vice President Joe Biden's involvement with Ukraine that is not supported\u00a0with credible\u00a0evidence. The Biden campaign requested that Facebook and other sites remove that ad due to misinformation, but Facebook refused, citing its policy. \"Joe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company,\" Trump's ad claimed. In fact, the prosecutor in question was considered by the United States and\u00a0international\u00a0groups to be ineffective at rooting out corruption in Ukraine.\u00a0There is no credible evidence\u00a0for the assertion that the ouster of the prosecutor was intended to benefit Hunter Biden. More: CNN says it won't air a Trump campaign ad featuring 'false' claim against Biden Warren said in her ad, \"If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks.\" CNN and NBCUniversal both refused to air Trump's ad targeting Biden with the Ukraine claims. The Trump campaign spent more than $1 million on Facebook\u00a0ads in one week in September\u00a0to beat back the impeachment inquiry, ABC News reports.\u00a0The ads come as House Democrats push their impeachment inquiry over whether the president pressured Ukraine's leader to investigate Biden in exchange for military aid. Warren's ad is the latest in her battle with big tech companies over her plan to promote competition in the tech industry and roll back tech company mergers, such as Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp. In leaked audio published by\u00a0The Verge, Zuckerberg said\u00a0\"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\" Warren replied in a\u00a0series of\u00a0tweets, saying she is \"not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable.\" More: Warren hits back at Facebook's Zuckerberg after he criticized her plan to break up big tech \"Facebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They\u2019ve decided to let political figures lie to you\u2014even about Facebook itself\u2014while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies,\" Warren tweeted\u00a0Saturday about her new Facebook ad. \"If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech,\" a Facebook spokesperson told CNN in a statement.

Elizabeth Warren took on a lot of that heat on Tuesday. Biden thinks that's a good thing, but questioned Warren's standing as a frontrunner in comments to reporters in Ohio on Wednesday. \"Well, it's kind of about time other people get questioned,\" he said. \"You know, I haven't seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a frontrunner. You guys keep talking about that.\" \"I think Elizabeth Warren's done very well,\" Biden added. \"She's moved, but now that she has moved and is taken more seriously, people are going to ask her about a little candor here.

Just ask her Democratic rivals The Massachusetts senator has led\u00a0Biden by a slim margin in several national polls and in some\u00a0early voting states like Iowa. While Biden had a significant lead on both Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earlier this year, data shows Warren steadily closing that gap. Warren faced attacks at the debate from South Bend, Indiana,\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who both pressed her on issues such as her Medicare for All plan. Warren has repeatedly skirted a direct answer when asked if her plan will require tax increases on the middle class, something Biden has criticized her for heavily. But she maintains that overall costs will go down. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential thing in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board,\" Biden said Wednesday. At the debate, tensions flared between Biden, whose vision for the Democratic Party includes an approach akin to the Obama-Biden administration, and Warren, who is an icon for some in the more progressive wing in the party. When Warren discussed her work on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama era, Biden jumped in, saying he had rounded up votes in the Senate for it. \"Let's get that straight,\" he said. Warren responded after a pause, \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\" Biden later cut her off, \"You did a hell of a job in your job.\" \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren deadpanned.",

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are at the front of the pack, according to polls. Who's leading between Biden and Warren? It depends on which polling outfit you ask. Biden leads Warren 32%-21% in the latest update from Politico-Morning Consult and 32%-22% in a poll released last week by Fox News.\u00a0 Warren leads by 3 percentage points in a Quinnipiac University poll published\u00a0Monday and by 4 points in an Economist-YouGov poll published last week. Until recently, Biden had led in virtually every major poll published since the\u00a0end of 2018, but\u00a0Warren has come out on top in eight\u00a0of the past 15 national polls. Monday's poll is the third survey\u00a0in a row from Quinnipiac in which Warren finished ahead of Biden. \"For Sen.\u00a0Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,\" Quinnipiac polling analyst Tim Malloy said. \"Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.\" October Democratic debate: Will Sanders attend? What are the issues? Here are 4 things you need to know Voters have the highest\u00a0expectations for Warren\u00a0heading into Tuesday's debate:\u00a029% of Democrats and those who lean Democrat\u00a0say\u00a0they think she will perform the best, 25% say\u00a0Biden and 13% say\u00a0Bernie Sanders, according to a Politico-Morning Consult poll conducted from Oct. 11-13. Fifty-eight percent of those voters say they are motivated to watch the debate, and 27% say\u00a0they are not motivated. Among all registered voters, 49% say\u00a0they are motivated to watch, and\u00a046% say\u00a0they aren't. Fifty-eight percent of registered voters say the debate is at least \"somewhat important,\" and\u00a033% say\u00a0it is \"not very important\" or \"not important at all.\" Among Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters, 71% say it is important, and 12% say\u00a0it is not. Last month, Warren began to pull ahead of Vermont Sen. Sanders, who\u00a0has come up third in most recent polls. More: Tulsi Gabbard says she will attend Tuesday Dem debate after considering a protest Since July, Warren and\u00a0Sanders had been locked in a virtual tie for second place in a majority of polls. The two have been the favorites of liberal voters in contrast with Biden who is the choice of more moderate Democrats. As Warren\u00a0surged to compete with Biden for the top spot, Sanders\u00a0\u2013 who suffered a heart attack\u00a0this month\u00a0\u2013 faded, finishing third in all but four of 22 polls conducted since mid-September. Warren is the choice of 50% of Democratic voters\u00a0and independents who lean Democratic\u00a0who identify as \"very liberal\"\u00a0in the poll from Quinnipiac. Sanders and Biden are tied at 14% within that group. Among those who call themselves \"somewhat liberal,\" Warren finishes\u00a0first at 34%, Sanders comes in at 17% and Biden at 15%. Biden is\u00a0the clear favorite among those who identify\u00a0as conservative Democrats at 36%;\u00a0Warren comes in  second at 19%, and Sanders is third at 6%.

But Democratic voters indicate\u00a0defeating President Donald Trump in the general election is their top priority, and about half of Democratic voters see Biden as the candidate best equipped to pull that off. Forty-eight percent say Biden has\u00a0the best chance of defeating Trump, and 21% see\u00a0Warren as the candidate with the best shot. While Biden has hovered at 42% to\u00a056% in Quinnipiac polls on this question, Warren had never finished higher than 9% in previous surveys from the pollster. More: Elizabeth Warren leads\u00a0Joe Biden in Democratic presidential primary polls When asked which Democratic candidate they think would be the best leader, 32% say\u00a0Biden and 28% say\u00a0Warren. On the question of impeachment, 46% say\u00a0Trump should be removed from office, and\u00a048% oppose\u00a0such a move. A\u00a0narrow majority of 51% approve\u00a0of the Democrat-controlled House's move to open an impeachment inquiry, and 59% say\u00a0they disapprove\u00a0of the way Trump has responded to the inquiry. Fifty-one percent say the impeachment is a \"legitimate\" investigation, and\u00a043% say\u00a0it is a \"political witch hunt.\" Though 66% say it is \"not acceptable\" for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival, as Trump encouraged\u00a0Ukraine to look at\u00a0Biden, only 44% say\u00a0that is a good enough reason to remove a president from office. The Quinnipiac poll was conducted Oct. 11-13 among 1,195 registered voters. It has\u00a0a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%.

For your weekend reading, we've started\u00a0in-case-you-missed-it compilations of some of the week's top\u00a0USA TODAY Opinion\u00a0pieces.\u00a0As always, thanks for reading, and\u00a0for your feedback. \u2014\u00a0USA TODAY Opinion editors By\u00a0Lauren Leader \"It has\u00a0been a big month\u00a0for Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren. ... But rising along with Warren is anxiety among corporate leaders, especially the growing number\u00a0of women working in the corporate sector, who fear her strident anti-corporate rhetoric could actually cost Democrats the presidency if she is the nominee. ... They fear that if\u00a0offended, big-company employees stay home in 2020, especially women, President Donald Trump\u00a0could win again.\" By\u00a0The Editorial Board \"(House Speaker Nancy Pelosi)\u00a0needs to call for a vote on launching an inquiry \u2014 sooner rather than later. ...\u00a0Americans should know where their elected representatives stand\u00a0on launching an inquiry. This isn't an impeachment vote.\u00a0And it isn't a mystery whether it would pass. ...\u00a0Moreover, such a vote would give the House impeachment investigation a stronger hand in court for obtaining White House documents and testimony.\" By\u00a0Kevin Gover \"The observance of Columbus Day is the outgrowth of a whitewashed history, perpetuated in public discourse and in our schools, where native and nonnative children, from the earliest age, are taught simplistic, incomplete and inaccurate information about American Indians. ... These narratives, in turn, influence government policies and shape how nonnatives respond to their Native American neighbors.\" By\u00a0Tom Nichols \"When (Democrats and I)\u00a0watched CNN's\u00a0LGBTQ town hall for the\u00a0Democratic candidates Thursday, we had very different reactions. ...\u00a0You thought it was great. You saw a ringing defense of LGBTQ rights and a reaffirmation of what Democrats stand for. I saw it and thought: Are these people insane? Are they trying to lose the election?\" By\u00a0Ross K. Baker \"Presidents have often been nettled by congressional committees but no president has ever successfully challenged the right of committees to take testimony from witnesses\u00a0thereby obstructing their ability to function as the framers intended. ...\u00a0\u00a0This act of subversion by President Donald Trump ...\u00a0is a frontal attack on a time-honored power of a legislative body handed down to us from centuries of British lawmakers.\" By Bandy X. Lee \"I have been compelled to blow two whistles: first, by publishing a book to alert the public that Donald Trump was more dangerous than perhaps any president in history, for psychological reasons; and second, on the American Psychiatric Association's actions that have effectively silenced those of us trying to fulfill our professional responsibility to society as outlined in its own code of ethics.\" By Yolonda Wilson \"Convicted murderers don\u2019t usually get hugs from the family of the victim. But last week,\u00a0Brandt Jean\u00a0explicitly told former Dallas police officer\u00a0Amber Guyger that he forgave her for shooting his brother Botham and asked the judge for\u00a0permission to hug her. ...\u00a0Jean has every right to do the thing that helps him heal and honor the memory of his brother. But in instances of unjust killings of black victims, why does the public laud\u00a0responses of forgiveness and criticize\u00a0those that include anger?\"",

      "content": " Meet the new front-runner: Elizabeth Warren. National polls still show Joe Biden with an edge over the rest of the Democratic presidential field, but the folks most intensely attuned to the contest \u2013 that would be the rivals competing for the nomination \u2013 were targeting Warren Tuesday night at the fourth of the Democratic debates. Flattering, perhaps, but a focus that she never had to handle in the previous debates, and one that sometimes put the Massachusetts senator on the defensive as she dodged questions about whether her Medicare for All plan would result in higher taxes on the middle class and if her proposed \u201cwealth tax\u201d could fly. \u201cI understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\u201d Warren declared.\u00a0Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar responded with a pointed\u00a0\u201creality check\u201d on Warren. \u201cI'm sorry, Elizabeth,\" Klobuchar said, although she didn't really sound sorry. \"I think we need to be honest here and tell the American people where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\" Winners and losers: Klobuchar, Buttigieg land some punches; billionaires on defense The debate didn\u2019t fundamentally shape or reshape the Democratic race, perhaps something not even a forum that stretched for more than three hours could do. But the more frontal challenges to Warren on various issues by almost everyone else\u00a0\u2013 Klobuchar,\u00a0South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, entrepreneur Andrew Yang\u00a0\u2013\u00a0came amid new questions about whether Biden could be deposed as the moderate alternative to the party's liberal heroes, Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. And Sanders had a prize in his pocket that could boost him, rather than Warren, among voters on the left.\u00a0During the debate, he teased that he would have a \"special guest\" at a campaign rally in Queens on Saturday.\u00a0That turned out to be New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as The Washington Post quickly reported, one of the party\u2019s most influential young liberal voices. All of the presidential candidates arrived on stage at Otterbein University in Ohio with things to prove: Biden about his family\u2019s ethics. Sanders about his personal health. Warren about her political electability. And the other contenders, now polling in single digits, about whether they could break through\u00a0\u2013 in some cases, whether they could even qualify for next month's debate, where the thresholds on fundraising and poll standing get higher. And when the debate was over? The political landscape for the debate was defined by this core question: Which candidate would be best able to defeat President Trump? That was the case Biden repeatedly tried to make for himself. He touted his age as a sign of wisdom and his experience as invaluable. \"I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,\" he said, citing the Violence Against Women Act and other legislation he helped enact while a senator from Delaware. That got Warren's attention. In the wake of the Great Recession, she noted, she had been instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an idea she said skeptics had dismissed as unrealistic. Biden jumped in, saying he had rounded up votes for it. \"Let's get that straight,\" he said. Warren made it clear that wasn't how she saw it. Speaking slowly and with deliberation, she replied: \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\" Sanders fired back at Biden, too. \"I say this as a friend,\" he said, \"but you got the Iraq war done.\" Biden vs. Warren: Two rivals debate whether party should strive for pragmatism or sweeping change The stage was crowded with a dozen Democrats, the biggest debate to date, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times.\u00a0Warren scored an overwhelming win by one measure: Who got the most time to speak, in large part because the moderators repeatedly gave her\u00a0time to respond to attacks.\u00a0In the end, she spoke for close to 23 minutes, far longer than Biden, a distant second at about 16-1/2. Which seems only fair. After all, she is, apparently, the new front-runner.",
