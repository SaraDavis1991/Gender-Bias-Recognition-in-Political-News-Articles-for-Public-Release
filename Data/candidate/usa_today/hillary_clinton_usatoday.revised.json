      "content": "It has long\u00a0been said that Republicans ought to\u00a0put country over party and stop defending the indefensible behavior of President Donald Trump. For the most part, this argument has\u00a0fallen on deaf ears for the obvious reason that\u00a0Trump still enjoys the support of the very same rank-and-file voters whom\u00a0Republican lawmakers\u00a0face in primary elections. A better argument might be that Republicans need to stand up to Trump \u2014\u00a0for the sake of their party's future. Some GOP lawmakers have, to their\u00a0credit, challenged\u00a0the president\u00a0on foreign policy issues such as Russian sanctions and Trump's hasty, ill-conceived decision to withdraw from Syria. But in repeatedly\u00a0turning a blind eye to his abuses of office, the GOP is branding itself as\u00a0bankrupt of principle and\u00a0interested only in clinging to power. More ominously, the GOP\u00a0is\u00a0turning\u00a0independent voters against it and abandoning\u00a0positions \u2014\u00a0such as support for law and order, fiscal responsibility, science, free trade, ethics in government and standing up to dictators abroad\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that long formed its political high ground. For much of Trump's first 1,000 days in office, a party that supposedly values the rule of law sat by as the\u00a0president attacked\u00a0prosecutors and judges who dared to question his actions. More recently, nearly all of its ostrich-like officeholders have put their heads in the sand\u00a0as\u00a0Trump used the power and prestige of the United States to pressure\u00a0Ukraine to investigate a potential general election opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden. This is the same party that tried to politicize a tragedy\u00a0at a\u00a0U.S. compound\u00a0in Benghazi, Libya,\u00a0in 2012 to make it look like a Hillary Clinton scandal. It\u00a0is also the party that impeached President Bill Clinton in 1998\u00a0after he had an\u00a0affair with a former White House intern. As the chart below\u00a0shows, many of the same Republicans who were quick to impeach or convict\u00a0then are now drooling poodles on Trump's lap. RNC: The future for Republicans, and America, has never looked brighter If the GOP doesn\u2019t recover its values, it will be hard to take the party seriously when it claims that a Democrat is doing something wrong. Its candidates, moreover,\u00a0will struggle to articulate what their party stands for: \u25baFamily values? Not when the president brags of grabbing women\u00a0and\u00a0pays\u00a0hush money to a porn star. \u25baThe rule of law and constitutional governance? Not when the president misuses\u00a0his powers for political gain. \u25baLimited government? Not when the president uses levers of power\u00a0to go after the head of Amazon, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the state of California, the auto industry, America\u2019s closest allies and many others \u2014\u00a0simply because they refuse to carry his water. \u25baConcern for conflicts of interest?\u00a0Not when the president selects one his own resorts to host\u00a0the summit\u00a0of the Group of Seven\u00a0major industrial nations. (One can only imagine how Republican politicians and conservative media outlets would have reacted if a Democratic president had done the same.) To be sure, Republican lawmakers are politicians who can't ignore their constituents.\u00a0But they are also the stewards of the GOP\u2019s future who shouldn't be cowering in fear of nasty tweets. How is it going to help conservatives get elected if their party has offended large swaths of the electorate? How\u00a0is toleration for self-dealing\u00a0and misuse of power going to be a selling point? As they contemplate these questions, they might actually find that doing the right thing turns out to be the\u00a0politically expedient thing. Rep. Robert Aderholt, Ala. Sen. (then-Rep.)

Trump had said on Twitter that because of Google's misdeeds, \"Google must be sued\" and added that his electoral victory should have been larger. PolitiFact, a nonpartisan fact-checking website, rated Trump's claim \"false.\" The site noted that Trump appeared to be referring to a 2017 research paper by psychologists Robert Epstein and Ronald Robertson. The paper had claimed that users' search results were biased in favor of Clinton, which could have possibly shifted votes to her. The paper's methodology and findings have been\u00a0questioned by other academics. who said the paper had failed to adequately explain its methodology or even define what \"bias\" was.

More: FEC chair Ellen Weintraub on Trump claims: 'No evidence of rampant voter fraud in 2016' When reached by the outlet, Epstein said Trump mischaracterized his work. \"I have never said that Google deliberately manipulated the 2016 election,\" he told PolitiFact. Epstein and Robertson had hedged their findings in their paper, too. \"We don\u2019t know what caused these patterns of bias,\" wrote Epstein and his co-author in the paper. Trump has frequently vented about his loss in the popular vote to Clinton. Trump won the electoral vote but lost the popular vote to Clinton by several million votes, and Trump has claimed that millions of Americans voted illegally for Clinton. The president has not provided evidence for these claims.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2013 A new report released by the Senate Intelligence Committee on Russian interference in the 2016 election has concluded that Russia acted to boost Donald Trump at the expense of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and delivers a call\u00a0for future action to prevent foreign election interference. The report's release comes as controversy swirls around President Donald Trump's requests to foreign nations to open investigations into his political opponent former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump asked Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family\u00a0and has also called on China to investigate them as well, though China said it would reject the request. The report says that the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency (IRA) \"sought to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election by harming Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of success and supporting Donald Trump at the direction of the Kremlin.\" Russia has denied any involvement in the 2016 election interference, though Russian President Vladimir Putin has joked about future interference in the 2020 election. The IRA's activities were\u00a0part of \"a broader, sophisticated, and ongoing information warfare campaign designed to sow discord in American politics and society\" the committee wrote. More: China rejects Trump's request to investigate Joe Biden, hoping to steer clear of U.S. politics More: 'Don't tell anyone': Putin jokes about Russia meddling in 2020 election Among other controversial issues, Russia attempted to inflame tensions around race and \"targeted African-Americans more than any other group or demographic.\" Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a Democratic presidential candidate, warned of future efforts to suppress African American voters and called on social media companies to hire more diverse staff in order to recognize future attempts to exploit racial tensions. \u201cRussian operatives fraudulently posed as Black Americans to actively discourage the Black community from voting,\" Harris said in a statement.\u00a0\"Social media companies must step up their efforts to fight disinformation and remove inflammatory content on their platforms, including by ensuring their workforces are diverse enough to identify and understand the cultural nuances that foreign actors exploit to divide and harm Americans. According to the Committee, the election interference efforts did not end with the 2016 election. The IRA actually increased its efforts after the conclusion of the 2016 election, in what Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr described as a \"broader\" goal \"to\u00a0sow societal discord and erode public confidence in the machinery of government,\" said Burr, warning of other election interference efforts by countries like China, North Korea, and Iran.\" The Committee concluded its findings with a call to action and efforts to fight back against future election interference. More: Donald Trump defends Syria policy, saying US is not abandoning Kurds by withdrawing troops As part of an effort to fight back against future interference, the Senate Intelligence Committee says \"the Executive Branch should, in the run up to the 2020 election, reinforce with the public the danger of attempted foreign interference in the 2020 election.\" They recommend the creation of an interagency task force to combat misinformation efforts and a public information campaign against foreign interference. Additionally, the Committee wants Congress to \"establish guardrails\" around social media to prevent future efforts. \u201cCongress must step up and establish guardrails to protect the integrity of our democracy. At minimum, we need to demand transparency around social media to prevent our adversaries from hiding in its shadows,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Committee.",

      "author": "Savannah Behrmann",
      "content": " WASHINGTON-- Hillary Clinton, former secretary of State and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, spent time Tuesday leafing through her emails that were on display at an art exhibit in Italy. Clinton, whose 2016 campaign was shadowed\u00a0by lingering questions after an\u00a0FBI investigation into her use of a private email server while leading the State Department, sat at a replica of the Oval Office Resolute Desk and thumbed\u00a0through thousands of emails during a\u00a0visit to an\u00a0art exhibit in Venice\u00a0titled \"HILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails.\" According to the description from exhibit co-organizer Zuecca Projects, the exhibit makes public \u201cfor the first time in printed format\u201d some\u00a060,000 pages of Clinton\u2019s emails which, according to WikiLeaks, \u201cwere sent from the domain clintonemail.com between 2009 and 2013.\u201d \"Hillary Clinton spent an hour yesterday reading her emails at my exhibition of all 62,000 pages of them in Venice,\" Artist Kenneth Goldsmith tweeted. The former Democratic presidential candidate and first lady was \u201cguided on a closed-door visit\u201d of the exhibition, the curators say in a statement. \"I think the scene was so extraordinary that many customers believed that she was just a lookalike at first,\" the show's curator, Francesco Urbano Ragazzi, told the Huffington Post. Clinton posted a picture of herself at the exhibit\u00a0Instagram, saying that she \"found\" the emails, so someone needed to \"alert the House GOP.\" Answering reporters questions outside the exhibit, Clinton told Italian news outlet TGR Veneto, \"It was and is still one of the strangest, most absurd events in American political history.\" \"And anyone can go in and look at them -- there's nothing there,\" Clinton says. \"It's an artistic way of making the same point that I made in the book I wrote, 'What Happened,' and that is, there was nothing wrong, there was nothing that should have been so controversial.\" On Twitter on Thursday morning, she said: \"Found my emails at the Venice Biennale. Someone alert the House GOP.\" During the 2016 White House race, then-candidate Donald Trump highlighted the long-simmering controversy surrounding\u00a0Clinton\u2019s usage of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of State,\u00a0and chants of \u201clock her up\u201d would often break out at his campaign rallies. Then-FBI Director James Comey\u00a0penned a letter to lawmakers after the\u00a0investigation that stated the FBI stood\u00a0by its original findings, made in July of 2016, that Clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information over email while\u00a0secretary of State. The often-derided refrain of \"but her emails\"\u00a0was\u00a0heard on the trail and on social media during the 2016 campaign to justify support for Donald Trump over Clinton. The remark was often attributed to Clinton opposers who were searching for a way to offset\u00a0the latest negative news about Trump. Clinton was reportedly already in Italy to attend an economic forum. In a statement provided to the Hill, the curatorial\u00a0team said\u00a0\u201cThe exhibition is a way to allude to an alternative world that will never exist. We are happy that the real Hillary Clinton has been part of this image full of possibilities. \"The exhibition is indeed the portrait of a powerful woman, but also the portrait of a historical change in our understanding of notions such as transparency, propaganda, public and private space,\u201d they also said.

After all, rumors of Clinton, 39, being groomed for New York's 17th Congressional District, have long been circulating. The district represents Rockland County and part\u00a0of Westchester County, including Chappaqua, where her parents, former president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, live. In an interview with The Journal News/lohud.com last year, Chelsea Clinton said she would consider a political run under certain circumstances. \u201cI think if someone were to step down or retire and I thought I could do a good job and it\u00a0matched my talents, I\u2019d have to think if it\u2019s the right choice for me,\u201d she said. While she didn\u2019t have any immediate plans to run for office, she told the paper,\u00a0it was something she thought about. \u201cIf you care about what\u2019s happening in the world, you have to care about running for and holding elected office,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cI hope it\u2019s a question that we ask ourselves.\u201d Chelsea Clinton's spokeswoman did not respond to an email this week about her plans, but whether she'll run is a question many are asking. On Twitter, PopularismUpdates\u00a0posted a side-by-side photo of Chelsea and Hillary Clinton (who\u00a0recently caused a Twitter storm of her own with her \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me\u201d response to President Donald Trump tweet urging her to run) tweeting:\u00a0\u201cToday Nita Lowey the Democratic representative for NY 17th Congressional District announced she is retiring. Chelsea Clinton has been speculated to run for this seat. America, it's not too late. Come 2020 we could have them BOTH in office at the same time.\u201d Chelsea Clinton does not live in the district, but unlike her mother, who had to establish residency in New York when she ran for a Senate seat in 2000, she would\u00a0not have to engage the services of a real estate agent any time soon. Members of the House of Representatives are not required to live in the district they represent; they are required\u00a0to be at least 25 years old, have been a U.S. citizen for at least seven years, and live in the state they represent. Chelsea Clinton\u00a0lives in Manhattan with her husband and three children, but could easily relocate\u00a0to the 17th District by moving\u00a0next door to her parents in Chappaqua. The Clintonsbought the\u00a0neighboring 3,600-square-foot home at 33 Old\u00a0House\u00a0Lane for $1.16 million in August 2016. Referring to reports it would be used as a getaway home for the couple's daughter and her family, Roni Jacobson, who has lived on Old House Lane since 1984, said when the Clintons bought the house:\u00a0\"It's a perfect house for (their daughter) Chelsea. Perfect mother-daughter situation. The neighbors are delighted for them.\" What does Lowey, the first woman to lead the powerful House Appropriations Committee, think about a possible Clinton run? \"She can do whatever she wants. She\u2019s an adult,\" said Lowey in an interview with The Journal News/lohud last November. \"When I decide to retire, I am sure the list will be very long (of people interested in the seat).\u201d More: Here are the lawmakers who aren't running again in 2020 On Sunday, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton will be in Hyde Park\u00a0where Chelsea is set to receive the\u00a0Eleanor Roosevelt\u00a0Val-Kill\u00a0Medal \u2014\u00a0which honors\u00a0the legacy of the late first lady \u2014\u00a0at the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site in Hyde Park.

      "content": " Chelsea Clinton ended speculation that she might\u00a0run for Congress next year during an appearance on the talk show \"The View\" on Wednesday. Clinton, 39, emerged as a\u00a0possible candidate\u00a0immediately following 30-year Rep. Nita Lowey's announcement on Thursday she\u00a0wouldn't seek reelection in 2020. She was considered a frontrunner in what is expected to be a crowded field, even though Clinton herself never said she was considering entering the race. On Wednesday, she directly addressed the rumors. \"I'm not considering running for Congresswoman Lowey's seat,\" Clinton said in response to a question from co-host Whoopi Goldberg. Chelsea Clinton: Could Chelsea Clinton run for a New York House seat? Clinton, daughter of former President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,\u00a0said she understood why people asked her about running. \"Someone has asked me some version of this question literally as long as I can remember,\" she said before recounting that she remembers being asked if she'd run for governor of Arkansas at age 3 or 4. \"I share that because I think it\u2019s a question that shouldn\u2019t just be asked of people whose last name is Clinton or Huntsman,\" she said, referring to co-host Abby Huntsman, the daughter of former Utah governor and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Hunstman. \"It\u2019s a question we should be asking kids, like, 'Do you think about running for office one day?'\" she said. \"I hope that if the answer to\u00a0that question is, 'Yes, I'm considering it,' that you'll really think about doing it and go to run for something.\" She said she wasn't sure if she'd run for office one day, but \"right now, the answer's no.\" October debate: Here are the winners and losers from Tuesday's Democratic debate Lowey, 82, is a longtime fixture in New York's 17th Congressional District, which includes Rockland County and part of Westchester County. Clinton's parents have lived in the ritzy hamlet of Chappaqua in the Westchester part of the district since leaving the White House at the turn of the century. Chelsea Clinton lives outside of the district in New York City, but the U.S. Constitution doesn't require a House member to live within the district he or she represents. Lowey, chairwoman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, is the first woman to head the committee. Since the district is reliably blue and overwhelmingly Democratic, her retirement has sparked interest from a number of local Democrats. 'To me it will always be Columbus Day.': Trump dismisses criticism of Christopher Columbus But the Clinton name\u00a0propelled her to the front of the pack\u00a0without so much as a public statement from the would-be candidate, and drew comparisons to Lowey's own abandoned\u00a0U.S. Senate race in 2000. The congresswoman, a Harrison resident, had eyed a run for the Senate seat that year but stepped aside to allow Hillary Clinton a clear path to the nomination. Hillary Clinton went on to win election against Republican Rick Lazio. In 2006, she won reelection to the Senate against former Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, now a Fox News host and friend of President Donald Trump. Clinton left the Senate in 2009 after running unsuccessfully for president to become President Barack Obama's Secretary of State. With Chelsea Clinton out of the running for the seat, there are two Democrats who are officially seeking the party nomination:\u00a0David Buchwald, a state Assemblyman from White Plains\u00a0who once interned for Lowey, and\u00a0Mondaire Jones,\u00a0who launched a primary challenge from the left in July well before Lowey's announcement she wouldn't seek reelection. Debate: CNN slammed for asking about Ellen, but not climate change, at Democratic debate Jones, 38, grew up in Spring Valley and attended Harvard Law School, raised $218,000 since launching his candidacy with the goal of becoming the first gay black man elected to Congress. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 2-to-1 in the 17th district, according to state Board of Elections figures. Registered voters without party affiliation also outnumber Republicans in the district, 110,000-103,000, according to state active voter numbers.

The interview was published minutes after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump over the president's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former vice president\u00a0Joe Biden and his son's business dealings in the Eastern European country. More: Read Nancy Pelosi's full remarks as she called for an impeachment inquiry of President Trump \"The president must be held accountable. No one is above the law,\" said Pelosi, who accused Trump of betraying his oath of office and endangering national security. Additionally, Clinton's comments\u00a0for impeachment came after a flood of Democrats, some of whom had previously held out against impeachment, joined the effort. Trump tweeted after Pelosi\u2019s announcement that the inquiry was \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d\u00a0and a \u201ctotal witch hunt.\u201d Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have pushed claims for months that Biden as vice president sought the\u00a0ouster in 2016 of Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to stop an investigation into Burisma Group, a Ukrainian energy company where his son\u00a0Hunter\u00a0served on the board of directors. The push by the vice president came alongside calls for Ukraine to get rid of Shokin from European diplomats and the U.S. State Department\u00a0because international leaders said Shokin did too little to fight corruption in the Eastern European country. The Ukrainian Parliament voted Shokin out. Ukrainian officials have found no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son. Contributing:\u00a0Bart Jansen and\u00a0Christal Hayes",

While Bill Clinton was president, he engaged in a\u00a0sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and was eventually\u00a0impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice in the wake of the extramarital affair. However, the Senate acquitted him of both charges, and Clinton went on to serve the remainder of his second term in office. Chelsea Clinton, when asked the same question after her mother, said\u00a0she was \u201coverwhelmed by my mother's answer that I'm a bit out of words.\u201d Clinton also told ABC that she had not been questioned in relation to recent reports\u00a0that the Trump administration is investigating the email records of dozens of current and former State Department officials who sent emails\u00a0to her private email address. \u201cI think it's an unfortunate diversion,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cYou go and you talk to people who've been experienced diplomats for many years, and then you retroactively classify what they said 10 years ago? I think it's really a shame that they're doing that, and hopefully people will not be distracted.\u201d On Tuesday, Clinton also sarcastically responded to\u00a0Rudy Guiliani,\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer,\u00a0who invoked the Clinton Foundation while defending his involvement in the Ukraine controversy\u00a0that has led to an impeachment inquiry into Trump. \u201cWP [Washington Post], NBC, and CNN are going after me because I\u2019m the messenger, and covering up the message, Dem corruption,\u201d Giuliani tweeted. \u201cMeanwhile, they have yet to ask Biden difficult questions because he is protected and immune like the Clintons and crooked Clinton Foundation!\u201d Clinton quote-tweeted his statement and quipped, \u201cYes, I am famously under-scrutinized.\u201d",

George Bush, his administration, and his colleagues actively discriminated and worked against the LGBT community.\" DeGeneres made light of\u00a0the situation on\u00a0\"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\"\u00a0Tuesday, calling for more tolerance and kindness. \"I\u2019m friends with George Bush,\" she said.\u00a0\"In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have. We\u2019re all different, and I think that we've forgotten that that\u2019s OK.\" Oh, and apparently Bush still owes her cash for nachos.

The U.S. ambassador to the European Union flew all the way from Brussels to speak to congressional investigators about his role in urging Ukraine's president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\u00a0But Gordon Sondland was a no-show.\u00a0The State Department directed Sondland not to appear before House Democrats pursuing\u00a0an impeachment inquiry of the president. Trump defended the decision to block the testimony, saying the Democrats' inquiry is illegitimate. The Dems called\u00a0the order to block the testimony obstruction\u00a0of justice, and they plan to subpoena the ambassador for his testimony, as well as documents.

      "content": " Hillary Clinton is not fond of the way the British media\u00a0has treated Duchess Meghan of Sussex. In an interview with The Sunday Times the former Secretary of State was asked about Prince Harry's decision to sue media outlets for their \"relentless\" and \"malicious\" coverage of his wife. \"I do want to say that the way she\u2019s been treated is inexplicable,\" Clinton told the outlet. The former presidential candidate was asked if she believed race was a factor in the media's portrayal. \"It\u2019s certainly part of it... Well, I think if the explanation is that she\u2019s biracial, then shame on everybody,\" Clinton said. Chelsea Clinton, who was also interviewed, noted that the media's treatment of the former Meghan Markle\u00a0is probably due to her advocacy work and willingness to break the mold of what a royal is expected to be like. \"She proudly had a career first and has a voice that she thankfully continues to use,\" Clinton said. \"\u00a0Anyone who has the temerity to break the mold of what has previously been established and expected often, unfortunately, receives criticism and bile that I don't understand. We've seen this pattern repeatedly.\" Chelsea Clinton added that while she doesn't personally know Meghan, she respects her. \"I\u2019m so grateful that she persists, and is unbowed, and is doing work she feels called to do,\" she said.\u00a0\"And isn\u2019t willing to be bullied.\" Earlier this month, Prince Harry issued an open letter\u00a0denouncing the coverage of his wife. \"Unfortunately, my wife has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences \u2013 a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son,\" he\u00a0wrote in a statement. The royal, 35, continued: \"I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\" Harry compared the media treatment of Meghan to that of his late mother, Princess Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 while evading\u00a0paparazzi. \"My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\" he wrote. \"I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\" Contributing: Cydney Henderson",

      "content": "MANCHESTER, N.H.\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 It's Hillary Clinton vs. Tulsi Gabbard on the sidelines of the 2020 presidential race. The Hawaii congresswoman fought back unsparingly after Clinton appeared to call her \"the favorite of the Russians\" in a recent interview and said she believes the Russians have \"got their eye on somebody who's currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.\" Clinton, the former senator, U.S. secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, did not name Gabbard directly. In a series of tweets Friday, Gabbard called Clinton the \"personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\" Gabbard also alleged there has been a \"concerted campaign\" to destroy her reputation since she announced her presidential run in January. \"It's now clear that this primary is between you and me,\" Gabbard tweeted about Clinton. \"Don't cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\" More: Mueller sounded an alarm on Russian meddling in the 2020 election. Here is what happened last time There is lingering trepidation in the Democratic Party of a repeat of the 2016 presidential race, when Russia interfered in the U.S. election in an effort to help Donald Trump defeat Clinton. U.S intelligence agencies have warned that Russia intends to meddle in the 2020 presidential election, as well. Russian President Vladimir Putin has mocked that possibility, joking earlier this month that Moscow would \"definitely intervene\" again. During a Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday, Gabbard criticized a TV commentator who she said had called her \"an asset of Russia.\" She called the comments \"completely despicable.\" Without naming Gabbard, Clinton seemed to echo the commentator's remark during a podcast appearance this week on \"Campaign HQ with David Plouffe.\" Plouffe was campaign manager for President Barack Obama in 2008 and served as served as a senior adviser to the president. \"She's the favorite of the Russians,\" Clinton said, referring to the person she had earlier identified as a woman \"who's currently in the Democratic primary.\" ''They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\" Clinton also called Trump \"Vladimir Putin's dream\" in the interview. She went on to say that Trump's inauguration speech was \"like a declaration of war on half of America.\" Clinton also describes 2016 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein as \"a Russian asset.\" The Russians know they can't win without a third-party candidate, Clinton added. Stein, who ran against Trump and Clinton as a Green Party candidate, received about 1% of the vote in the 2016 election, but some Democrats said her candidacy syphoned votes away from Clinton and helped Trump win, particularly in states like Wisconsin. The Senate Intelligence Committee asked Stein for documents as part of its probe into Russian interference in the election because she attended a 2015 dinner in Moscow sponsored by Russian television network RT with Putin. Stein has said she attended \"with a message of Middle East peace, diplomacy and cooperation.\" In a tweet Friday, Stein accused Clinton of \"peddling conspiracy theories to justify her failure instead of reflecting on real reasons Dems lost in 2016.\"",

      "content": " As U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard walked around tailgate parties for Homecoming weekend at the University of Iowa, one man gave her a Hawkeyes-themed Russian cossack hat. Another shouted \"screw Hillary!\" as Gabbard drove from party-to-party on a golf cart. Some Iowans showed their support for Gabbard after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested that Russians are \"grooming\" a Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0to run as a third-party candidate Friday. While Clinton did not name Gabbard, the comment appeared to be directed at the Democrat from\u00a0Hawaii. On Saturday, Gabbard said the past 24 hours had \"a lot of news,\" but it brought to the forefront the reasons why she believes her campaign is important: it threatens the party's establishment. More: Tulsi Gabbard fires back at Hillary Clinton suggestion that she's Russia's pawn Gabbard has said multiple times she is not considering a third-party run, both before and after Clinton's statement. \"She knows she can't control me,\" Gabbard told the Des Moines Register on Saturday.\u00a0\"She knows that if I'm the nominee, if I become president, she can't have any influence or any control over the kind of foreign policy I would lead our country in. Both her and her proxies and the foreign policy establishment.\" Gabbard said Clinton was the \"queen of warmongers\" on Twitter Friday in response to her comments. Despite the back-and-forth between Gabbard and Clinton, Gabbard was met with good cheer by Hawkeyes fans Saturday morning. A group of people at a tiki bar tailgate drank a round of Fireball whiskey shots in her honor, shouting \"Tulsi time!\" as she mingled with the crowd. Maria Frazer, a 21-year-old University of Iowa student, is still deciding who she wants to support in the Iowa caucus. She's heard allegations about Gabbard's ties with Russia, but while she doesn't \"necessarily buy into it,\" Frazer said Americans should be wary of foreign governments' influence in the presidential election. \"I am concerned, not necessarily about Tulsi,\" she said. \"But it's something I'm very cautious about. I think we need to be cautious about in the future.\" Chris Forbes, a 52-year-old man in Iowa City, gave Gabbard a Twinkie as they talked politics. He already committed to caucus for U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, but said it's important for foreign policy to take a bigger role in the presidential election\u00a0\u2014 something Gabbard brings. He doesn't agree entirely with Gabbard's positions. Forbes said\u00a0the U.S. military should still play some role in foreign conflicts, especially in cases when allies are at risk, like the Kurds in northern Syria following President Donald Trump's decision to leave the region. \"I agree that steps should be made to pull away from some of the actions of being the world's policemen,\" Forbes said. \"But I also believe the\u00a0standard of American democracy for 240 years has been to be a beacon of freedom for the rest of the world. And as such, we need to have just enough present\u00a0to represent that freedom and world leadership toward democracy so that all groups can feel safe in being free to stand openly for what they believe.\" Gabbard said Clinton and other Democrats accusing her of being a \"Russian asset\" is a strategy to stop Americans from criticizing U.S. foreign policy decisions. \"This threatens our freedom of speech and is very revealing about the real motives behind this smear campaign that literally began the day I announced my candidacy for president,\"\u00a0Gabbard said.

      "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 The State Department has completed its internal investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of private email and found violations by 38 people, some of whom may face disciplinary action. The investigation, launched more than three years ago, determined that those 38 people were \"culpable\" in 91 cases of sending classified information that ended up in Clinton's personal email, according to a letter sent to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley this week and released on Friday. The 38 are current and former State Department officials but were not identified. Although the report identified violations, it said investigators had found \"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.\" However, it also made clear that Clinton's use of the private email had increased the vulnerability of classified information. The Associated Press sent an email seeking comment to a Clinton representative. More: Fact check: 12 questions and answers about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails The investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public. The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified but could not assign fault in 497 cases. For current and former officials, culpability means the violations will be noted in their files and will be considered when they apply for or go to renew security clearances. For current officials, there could also be some kind of disciplinary action. But it was not immediately clear what that would be. The report concluded \"that the use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of State Department networks.\" The department began the review in 2016 after declaring 22 emails from Clinton's private server to be \"top secret.\" Clinton was then running for president against Donald Trump, and Trump made the server a major focus of his campaign. Then-FBI Director James Comey held a news conference that year in which he criticized Clinton as \"extremely careless\" in her use of the private email server as secretary of state but said the FBI would not recommend charges. The Justice Department's inspector general said FBI specialists did not find evidence that the server had been hacked, with one forensics agent saying he felt \"fairly confident that there wasn't an intrusion.\" Grassley started investigating Clinton's email server in 2017, when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Iowa Republican has been critical of Clinton's handling of classified information and urged administrative sanctions.",
