      "subtitle": "Kenneth Vogel and Hadas Gold write in Politico about the latest trouble to strike Glenn Beck\u2019s media empire, as Beck and one of his advertisers sue each other over unpaid bills and claims that the radio talker\u2019s\u00a0endorsement of Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign and increasingly shrill denunciations of Donald Trump alienated his audience. Politico notes that Beck\u2019s diminished relevance is juxtaposed by the rising influence of Breitbart News, which \u2014 along with Matt Drudge, Sarah Palin, and Sean Hannity \u2014 Beck has repeatedly attacked during this election cycle.",
      "author": "Breitbart News",
      "content": " From Politico: Glenn Beck\u2019s dreams of building a dominant conservative media empire are faltering amid a tangle of lawsuits, financial challenges, plunging on-line readership, firings and political feuds. Beck, who in his days as Fox News host was among the leading voices of the anti-establishment right, invested heavily to parlay that influence into a wide-ranging media enterprise including not just a syndicated radio show, but also his own television network, news website, movie studio, book publishing imprint and clothing line. And now a lawsuit claims that perhaps Beck\u2019s biggest bet of all \u2014 his endorsement of Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 further undermined his appeal. People who previously worked with Beck described his decision to devote himself to electing Cruz \u2014 for whom he hit the campaign trail and turned his shows into de facto infomercials only months after renouncing politics and the GOP \u2014 as a last-gasp bid for renewed relevance. But as Cruz started falling behind eventual nominee Donald Trump, Beck grew increasingly strident, calling Trump a \u201cnarcissistic psychopath\u201d who would lead the country into civil war, and picking fights with big name Trump supporters on the populist right. [\u2026] \u201cEndorsing Cruz was a last-ditch attempt to get back into the spotlight by a guy who craves attention, but it actually made it impossible for him to run the business,\u201d said a former associate who was close to Beck. Some advertisers complained to Beck\u2019s representatives that the host\u2019s increasing combustibility was becoming bad for business, two people familiar with the complaints told POLITICO. One longtime advertiser, a solar survivalist company called Solutions from Science (SFS), allegedly stopped paying its advertising invoices after unsuccessfully trying to pull its ads from Beck\u2019s syndicated radio show. [\u2026] And lately, other conservative media outlets have become more influential, most notably the populist conservative website Breitbart News, which backed Trump while openly antagonizing Beck. Breitbart\u2019s executive chairman Steve Bannon, who has taken a leave to help run Trump\u2019s campaign, has arguably supplanted Beck as the leading media visionary on the anti-establishment right. Beck in turn has peddled wild conspiracy theories about Bannon, whom he called \u201cpossibly the most dangerous guy in all of American politics.\u201d In his interview with POLITICO, Beck said he was getting ready to launch a comeback plan for The Blaze, which he dubbed \u201cProject Phoenix, Blaze 2.0.\u201d But he also suggested that his enemies on the right and left were working to stymie him after his endorsement of Cruz. \u201cThe world currently is punishing anyone who takes a stand. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a guy who\u2019s used to being called names. But I was shocked at how the right plays exactly the same game as the left. I\u2019ve always known that there were dirtbags on both sides, but the exact same tactics used to try to discredit me from the Soros left was used by the Bannon right,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthere is no difference between those two, practically.\u201d The attacks on Soros\u2019s tactics seem to echo the theme of Beck\u2019s 13th book, \u201cLiars: How Progressives Exploit Our Fears for Power,\u201d which was released recently and became a New York Times bestseller. A Soros spokesman declined to comment on Beck, as did Bannon. Bill Heid, the CEO of Solutions from Science, who has known Beck for years, asserted \u201cdelusions of grandeur got the best of Glenn Beck.\u201d The host \u201cbecame a man possessed when it came to Ted Cruz,\u201d Heid said.

      "subtitle": "Tuesday night\u2019s vice presidential debate in Farmville, Virginia between Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine is not a fair fight. Pence will\u00a0dominate \u2014 while the country will worry anew about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health, given her replacement.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Back in July, when Clinton and Donald Trump\u00a0announced their respective running mates, it seemed that\u00a0the vice presidential debate might actually overshadow the presidential bouts, given that Pence and Kaine have more impressive resum\u00e9s in public life than either of the people that selected them.\u00a0Both men have been governors; Pence built a solid reputation as a leader on Capitol Hill, while Kaine was one of the Democrats\u2019 more respected voices on foreign policy on the Sunday talk show circuit. But since then, Pence\u00a0has rocked the campaign trail, while Kaine has been\u00a0a wet rag. While Pence has played\u00a0to packed houses across the country, Kaine has struggled to draw anyone at all, even in swing states where the contest is closest. Thus far, Kaine\u2019s only noteworthy contributions to his side\u2019s efforts have been his repeated, shrill accusations that Donald Trump is associated with the Ku Klux Klan, and his lies defending Clinton on her mis-handling of classified information. Overall, Pence has been a net positive for the Trump campaign, reassuring the public that Trump will a) appoint competent people to high posts, and b) be replaced by a capable leader, should the worst happen. By contrast, Kaine has been a net negative for the Clinton campaign. He seems to have been chosen for the sole reason that he would not overshadow her on stage. In fact, when they appear together, she seems more likely to lose. It is difficult to imagine Kaine running the country. The pattern is unlikely to change on Tuesday. Kaine will be sent onstage with a set of attack lines against Trump to reinforce Clinton\u2019s talking points from the last debate. Pence\u2019s job will be to look presidential, a task Kaine will make easier for him. The conventional wisdom is that vice presidential debates do not matter much. But they do affect a campaign\u2019s momentum. In 2008, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin stunned a skeptical media, which expected her to fail, by outperforming then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE). The result was renewed zeal on the campaign trail for a ticket that appeared to be flagging since the first debate and the disastrous decision of Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) to suspend his campaign during the financial crisis. In 2012, Biden put Barack\u00a0Obama\u2019s re-election effort back on track after the president was beaten badly by Gov. Mitt Romney in the first debate. Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, who had prepared well for a genteel\u00a0battle of wits and policies, was stunned by Biden\u2019s antics and outbursts, which seemed clownish but successfully conveyed contempt for Ryan to a national audience. Pence will not only\u00a0give the Trump campaign a boost, but also force the media to consider, once again,\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s health issues, which remain shrouded in mystery, as well as her judgment, which Trump has repeatedly called into question. That, in turn, will set Trump up for the remaining two debates \u2014 and, perhaps, for one last, and decisive, surge in the polls. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Palin recalled: Obama was leading by double digits [in Michigan], but the Grand Rapids meeting gave me hope that we could bounce back and turn the state around. I got to tell Michigan, \u201cThank you for taking care of my son\u2014now he\u2019s taking care of you!\u201d \u2026 We kicked the next morning off with a lot of prep for the day\u2019s events, including an on-camera interview atop the hotel with Fox News reporter Carl Cameron, with the St. Louis Gateway Arch framed in the shot behind me. Among his other questions, he asked what I thought of the campaign pulling out of Michigan. \u201cYes, I read that this morning,\u201d I answered, then said I wished we weren\u2019t pulling out of Michigan\u2014that every single person and every single vote mattered, and I sure didn\u2019t want anyone to give up anywhere. No harm giving a little shout-out to the Great Lakes State, I thought. No one had mentioned to the VP staff or me that the campaign was even considering pulling out of Michigan, much less that we already had. So when I was asked about it, I was caught a bit off guard, but I answered truthfully about having read about it in the newspaper. We moved on to the next question and wrapped up the interview. No big deal. But we soon heard that back at headquarters, it was a big deal. The word came hurtling down that I had been \u201coff script\u201d with Cameron. Of course, it\u2019s pretty easy to issue candid, off-script messages when there is no script to begin with. It wasn\u2019t the end of the world, though, and I hoped headquarters would forgive me and move on. They didn\u2019t. One or more McCain senior staffers would later anonymously tell reporters that I was \u201cgoing rogue.\u201d The VP team had been scheduled to do another event in Michigan, but it was canceled, disappointing a lot of us who had appreciated that September 17 town hall meeting with John. Still, we understood that funding was limited, so I suggested to the VP staff that the next time we had an official event near Michigan, we pass the hat for gas money and just do a quick trip across the border to snap one off-the-record photo at a caf\u00e9 or gas station, maybe hold a quick grassroots rally. I thought we would send a positive message to the state that way, show the people that our campaign really did care about their votes. It would be fast, it would be free, it would be\u2026mavericky. What was the worst that could happen? We\u2019d maybe get a few more votes? Headquarters said no. With the strange pushback we were getting by then, we were tempted just to sneak across the border. More than once, Nicolle had summarized the\u00a0campaign organization well when, during chaotic moments, she turned to the B Team and said with a resigned smile, \u201cWelcome to the pirate ship.\u201d But we didn\u2019t want our throats cut, so we dropped the road trip idea and tried to find a copy of the script so we could stay on it. \u2026 I can\u2019t help but think of Michigan\u2014the state where I \u201cwent rogue\u201d trying to reach out to during the campaign. Some of the people in Michigan are hurting the most right now in our\u00a0economic downturn.\n\nMichigan is a good example of why we must stand up and not give up! We must fight for reform and fight to reclaim these places suffering under the weight of decades of failed big-government policies\u2014the very policies that now threaten to overtake us all. We can\u2019t abandon Michigan and places like it. We\u2019re Americans. We don\u2019t give up on each other. \u2026 I\u2019ve been asked a lot lately, \u201cWhere are you going next?\u201d Good question! I\u2019ll be heading home to Alaska, of course. Back to that kitchen table. We\u2019ll discuss the day\u2019s news and the next stop. I always tell my kids that God doesn\u2019t drive parked cars, so we\u2019ll talk about getting on the next road and gearing up for hard work to travel down it to reach new goals. I\u2019m thinking when I get back I\u2019ll bake the kids a cake. And I\u2019ll pull out a road map\u2014I want to show Piper the way to Michigan. Update: Palin has released a statement on Facebook: Going Rogue, again! Finally. Hitting the trail with Willow and Piper to get out the vote for our next President, Donald J. Trump. We\u2019ll hit Michigan, North Carolina, New York. When asked to travel this time, I knew it had to be Michigan \u2013 such a special place that can soon be \u201cThe Comeback State\u201d with robust industry again. Love it. Personally close to the heart as my son lived there for AAA hockey. Politically, long story but this is where the whole \u201cshe went rogue!\u201d thing started in \u201908, leading to my book, \u201cGoing Rogue\u201d (even kicked off the most fun book tour ever there!). Now, Michigan, it\u2019s up to you and every one of these United States to Go Rogue for America.

      "subtitle": "The first time I attended a professional football game two USFL squads rather than NFL franchises played. The Michigan Panthers and the New Jersey Generals collided in the Garden State, and for a boy who had never been to a game until then, it may as well have been the Super Bowl.",
      "author": "Kevin Scholla",
      "content": " For Millennials and others not in the know, the USFL was legit; real football in the spring and summer. The United States Football League competed with the old guard. When it eventually folded, countless USFL stars took their talents to the National Football League. From Steve Young to Reggie White to Jim Kelly, the upstart league gave these future Hall of Famers their start. But the stars of the USFL weren\u2019t only the players. The Generals owner did quite well for himself, too. This week he may be elected president of the United States. From a sports standpoint I have only fond memories of the USFL. My most personal reflection on the league, however, pertains to the kindness of Donald Trump. Yes, that Donald Trump. Trump owned the Generals franchise. The club possessed no shortage of stars with NFL futures, such as Herschel Walker and Doug Flutie, or NFL pasts, such as Brian Sipe. Playing in the world\u2019s biggest media market the team did things big. No one was more Big League than their owner. It was the mid-1980s and I was taking in my first football game with my grandfather. To say I was excited would be a gross understatement. Despite poor weather conditions I was Gung Ho for a big day at the Meadowlands. Honestly, I don\u2019t remember much about the game itself, but I do remember the wonderful time I had with my grandfather. I also remember my first encounter with Donald J. Trump. As the weather worsened at Giants Stadium, fans started to file out of the facility. Surely, my grandfather who had already seen his share of Jets games at Shea over the years would have probably followed suit if not for his grandson, who wouldn\u2019t want to leave under any circumstances. So, we stuck it out. Our seats weren\u2019t bad that day but we were pretty far back in the lower seating bowl\u2014until Mr. Trump stepped in. A Generals employee approached my grandfather and me and thanked us for staying when most of the crowd had cleared out. He then informed us that Mr. Trump would like to move us to the front row behind the end zone because of our loyalty to the game. Wow. Anyone would surely appreciate this move, but for an elementary school kid this was beyond Yuge. We enjoyed the rest of the game that day from the first row. I never forgot it. About a decade later, the U.S. Open came to my hometown. I\u2019m not a golf guy now and wasn\u2019t then, either. But the event was almost in my backyard. Everyone wanted to go to Baltusrol, the home of the 1993 open. The town of Springfield, New Jersey, buzzed. I remember golf superstars walking the neighborhood and patronizing our local businesses. I remember my parents considering selling parking spaces in our driveway. But what I remember most was another encounter with Donald Trump. Yet again, his kindness shined through. I scored passes to the U.S. Open through some family friends in local government. I headed to the links with a few buddies. We were a bunch of rogues. All of us either in or just out of college. We were basically beer and football guys who somehow descended on a golfing major. While I didn\u2019t care much about who sat atop the leader board, I did get a kick out of seeing the event unfold. The mass of people and media was not the norm for our town. My friends and I took it all in. We strolled from hole to hole and more importantly we moved from party tent to party tent. For young men in their early twenties on a beautiful spring day, this was the life. Then things got even cooler. We were just hanging out on a ramp that led to one of the tents when I noticed who I thought was Donald Trump. The hair was instantly recognizable. After all, Trump\u2019s face was in our homes all the time. We saw him on TV commercials and we saw him at pay-per-view boxing events. Even though he moved our seats at the Generals game all those years ago, this was the first time seeing the man face to face. When I told my friends it was Trump, they thought it was great but they all knew I\u2019d be the one to take things further. Never shy, even back then, I yelled \u201cHi, Mr. Trump\u201d across the course. I didn\u2019t realize he was on his mobile phone. No one had mobile phones in the early \u201990s, but of course Trump did. I expected him to ignore us or perhaps even tell us to get lost since he was on a phone call. He did neither. The billionaire businessman instead hung up his call and talked to us\u2014yes, us. A man friends with world leaders and world champions stopped to take the time to hang with idiot college kids. Trump asked us if we were having fun and where we were from. Then he told us where the \u201cgood tent\u201d was. Apparently it was a tent he had set up for one of his relatives. We thanked him and absolutely took him up on his offer. We headed to the private tent with Trump\u2019s blessing. Sure enough the tent had Trump all over it. The fare was similar to the other tents, featuring great barbecue and the like, but unlike the other tents there was real silverware and flatware. No paper plates and plastic forks in a Trump tent\u2014well, of course not. Just like at that football game years ago, the fun day I had on the links was made even more memorable thanks to Donald Trump. A couple years later, I saw Trump again. Again, major pro sports provided the backdrop. It was the U.S. Open Tennis Open in Flushing, New York. It was my first time at this event, but regulars such as Don Imus and Donald Trump attended. Our seats were relatively close to Trump\u2019s box seats. As I walked by him we said hello and shook his hand. Nothing earth shattering, just a quick hello. But again Trump was genuinely friendly. As I sat down to take in the greatest tennis players in the world, I told the woman who accompanied me that night about the other two times Trump demonstrated great warmth toward me, my friends, and my family. As far as I was concerned, this was a good man. He was three-for-three with me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a mistake that I met Trump at several sporting events. It speaks to the normalness of the man. He really is that blue-collar billionaire people talk about. He is a sports fan just like the construction worker, the bus driver, and the police officer. Unlike those who need a teleprompter for every word they say or who pretend they are sports fans when it\u2019s the popular thing to do, Trump is not phony. He wont be a Cubs fan one minute and a Yankees fan the next like his opponent. Trump keeps it real. I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019ve been a supporter of Trump\u2019s run for the White House from the start. In fact, this is the first time in my life that the person I voted for in the primary (non-incumbent) is actually the nominee for president. That\u2019s exciting. I\u2019m backing Trump because I know he is the best man for our security, our economy, our children, and our country. But, knowing that the man has great character played a role in this as well. The Clinton campaign has been all about smearing Mr. Trump. Hillary and friends have painted a false narrative about the man Trump truly is. Democrats, Never Trumpers, phony Republicans, and the media have lied at every turn. Most of these people do not know Mr. Trump. Many of them have never met him. During this historic race for the presidency, I had the honor of interviewing Donald Trump. I told him on the air and off the air about my past run-ins with him. I was happy to let him know that his kindness was appreciated, even decades later. In my interview with Mr. Trump and during our chat off the air, he lived up to the memories I had of the man. The guy who moved a crazed football kid down to better seats, the man who took the time to hang with college guys on a golf course, the man who was happy to exchange pleasantries at a tennis match, was the same man now. He just happens to be oh so close to becoming our 45th president. Trump haters like to point to that ridiculous Access Hollywood tape when trying to bring Trump down. One example of a private conversation. A man who\u2019s been in the spotlight forever, yet that\u2019s all they have. I have four examples that paint quite a contrary picture. I have only been around Mr. Trump briefly. My daughter and I got to meet him at his big rally in Newtown, Pennsylvania, recently. Though, the meetings have been few, Trump has always been amazing. But, if you don\u2019t want to believe me, I can recommend some people you can talk to. Trump\u2019s children, his employees such as Lynne Patton and Katrina Pierson, and his supporters including Sarah Palin and Ben Carson all know Mr. Trump very well. I\u2019ve interviewed all of these people. These are honest, real folks. They all vouch for Trump. They all have confirmed that my snapshots in time with the man are the real articles. Trump is a good guy. Trump is a great man. In the remaining hours leading up the election, we know what\u2019s coming. Relentless attacks will be fired at Trump. Hillary Clinton will attempt to tear down his character. He will be called disgusting things, even though he was never labeled with any of these awful traits before he decided to seek office. Funny, how he is suddenly a monster when he\u2019s this close to shaking up Washington. These are lies. When Tuesday rolls around ladies and gentlemen, vote on issues, vote with your heart, and vote based on the person. But don\u2019t fall for the false narratives. Don\u2019t believe the outright lies. Don\u2019t get tricked by those that say Donald Trump is a horrible person. Take it from me, Mr. Trump has been a good sport from way back.",

      "author": "Sarah Palin",
      "content": " Michigan really can be the \u201cComeback State.\u201d I told people at my recent rallies there that they are blessed with every element of a perfectly positive storm that could, finally, rev up their state\u2019s economy like they deserve: the natural resources, the industrial infrastructure, and most importantly the manpower and work ethic. And now, finally, Michigan has chosen a pro-private sector presidential candidate who knows how to create jobs. I\u2019ve felt this way about Michigan for many years, including in 2008 when the McCain/Palin campaign staffers shocked us with unexpected news that the campaign was pulling out of the Great Lakes State. I remember my jaw dropped when I was asked on the air what I thought about us \u201cgiving up\u201d on Michigan. I believe it was FOX News\u2019 \u201cCampaign Carl\u201d Cameron who caught me like a Michigan deer in the headlights, asking me that question. The campaign had forgotten to give me the memo evidently. I remember candidly responding something like, \u201cWhat? We\u2019re not going to Michigan? Why? Every vote counts!\u201d It was a rotten decision to bail on Michigan. That night our small \u201cJV Team\u201d (they called the VP campaign the \u201cB Team\u201d or \u201cJV\u2019ers\u201d) had a better idea than that A-Team, which seemed to be giving up on not only\u00a0Michigan but the entire campaign at that point. The campaign was just going to land at a hotel on the road anyway that night, so we decided we\u2019d rent a car and zip to Michigan instead of sleeping. We\u2019d campaign there on our own and show Michigan some love and respect, then zip back to make it in time for our next rally. We\u2019d ask for forgiveness later. I figured the A-Team would never be the wiser because some of them didn\u2019t know what their own plans looked like, much less what a good plan looked like. Somebody leaked our plan, then someone told someone else at \u201cheadquarters\u201d (we ask each other still today where \u201cheadquarters\u201d was) that whomever was driving the rental car would be arrested if we \u201cwent rogue\u201d and drove over the state border, and that I\u2019d better never think of \u201cgoing rogue\u201d again. What a day. It pretty much changed my life. The whole Michigan experience empowered many of us because we knew that to disrespect a state in our union \u2014 when professional politicos had nothing better planned anyway that night \u2014 was disrespecting the hardworking patriots who weren\u2019t asking much of their government; they just wanted opportunity to work. After that day the \u201cshe\u2019s going rogue\u201d mantra stuck, especially every time I spoke candidly and ignored the TelePrompTer. I wrote the bestseller\u00a0Going Rogue with Michigan as an inspiration. So, watching those Trump numbers come in from Michigan \u2014 knowing it was a key state to flip for victory and, more importantly, knowing that Michigan deserves her turn at prosperity again \u2014 was an answer to prayer. Those Michigan Independents, Republicans and good Reagan Democrats, who know the political status quo has to go, put their faith in the GOP ticket. They\u2019re putting faith in those they elect to not jump off the planks in the America First platform. They cannot be let down again. The whole nation is pulling for the once robust industrial cities like Detroit. We want to buy American-made everything. And once government gets off our back and gets back on our side, we can do it. At a recent Trump rally in Michigan, I told the crowd that Hillary\u2019s decision to play the woman card wouldn\u2019t work in Michigan. Voting her the first woman president wasn\u2019t going to happen, not because of sexism, but because she\u2019s out of touch. She admitted that she hasn\u2019t\u00a0driven a vehicle in decades. I said, \u201cI want the first woman president to be connected to the people and to at least have driven a car lately. Heck, better yet \u2014 I want our first woman president to drive a truck. Made in Detroit!\u201d",

Maggie Hassan, who ran as future partner to her party\u2019s nominee for president Hillary R. Clinton\u2013while Ayotte struggled to describe her own place in relation to Trump, her party\u2019s nominee. \u201cAs you all know, I entered public service as an advocate for people who experience disabilities,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople whose voices are too often not heard. I believe we are stronger when we listen to all voices and all perspectives. We are stronger when we are working to ensure that every person has the opportunity to share in our nation\u2019s success.\u201d The governor declared victory before the final ballots were counted and without a concession from the Ayotte campaign, whose spokeswoman offered this statement:\u201cThis has been a closely contested race from the beginning, and we look forward to results being announced by the Secretary of State, and ensuring that every vote is counted in this race that has received an historic level of interest.\u201d The New Hampshire Secretary of State certified 100 percent of the state\u2019s ballots counted, giving Hassan the nod over Ayotte by 1,023 votes. Clinton beat Trump by 1.437 votes in the battle for the state\u2019s four electoral votes. In an Oct. 3 debate with Hassan, Ayotte said she thought Trump was a role model for children, but soon walked it back: \u201c\u201dI corrected that because I made a mistake. I mean debates many people are \u2014 you\u2019re asked a lot of questions at a debate. But it\u2019s clear to me that neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton, unfortunately, are role models.\u201d In her final construct, the former state attorney general said: \u201cI will stand up to Donald Trump, but I will vote for him.\u201d The senator never campaigned with Trump. Ayotte was a distant third in the GOP primary for Senate in 2010, when she was plucked up by Sarah Palin, who called her a \u201cmama-grizzly\u201d and made her the front runner.\u00a0In those days, Ayotte campaigned as a member of the Tea Party and disciple of Palin. But, over time in Washington, Ayotte drifted away from her mentress, who in 2013 denounced Ayotte for supporting the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty bill for illegal aliens. When Capitol Hill conservatives forced the partial shutdown of the federal government in September-October 2013, the senator joined with Democrats to undercut conservatives. New Hampshire law allows candidates to request a recount if the deciding margin is at least 20 percent of the votes cast.",

He\u2019s a patriot; a military veteran and proud Army dad. Bannon\u2019s talents are on display in many venues, my favorite being his production of the documentary \u201cThe Undefeated.\u201d Please, watch the film \u201cThe Undefeated.\u201d Bannon understood the media\u2019s coverage of the 2008 election defined \u201cinjustice\u201d and \u201cdouble standard.\u201d More importantly, he did something about it. I\u2019ll be forever grateful, as will other Commonsense Conservatives who will not stand for the press\u2019s politics of personal destruction.

The film charts her rise as a corruption fighting mayor and governor in Alaska, her entrance on the national stage as Senator John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2008, and\u00a0her leadership in the grassroots Tea Party movement that ushered in historic electoral victories for the GOP. The film opened on a montage of leftwing hate and smears directed at Palin as a result of her energizing the Republican base in 2008. Earlier in her post, Palin noted, \u201cObviously we look forward to a fundamental restoration of American exceptionalism under a President beholden to no one but we the people, but in addition, be thankful for the coming monumental change in journalism. Ready to stop rewarding the media\u2019s engagement in politics of personal destruction? Demand and declare it changes now.\u201d",

      "content": " Palin said the 2016 election was vindication for \u201cme and millions of other Americans who, for years and years, have been saying smaller, smarter government is the answer, and we need someone who is politically incorrect enough to say what needs to be said, and do what needs to be doin\u2019, to fix the problems that we\u2019re in in our nation.\u201d LISTEN:  Marlow said he thought Trump\u2019s campaign theme of \u201cdraining the swamp\u201d in DC was \u201cchanneling Sarah Palin.\u201d She countered that the concept was \u201cpretty universal, when people understand what our Constitution actually means, and that it is to restrain federal government, and not incentivize growth of the federal government \u2013 more control, more shackles over the people.\u201d \u201cSo draining the swamp is so necessary on the local government level, the state government level, and of course the federal government level. We need to not allow the will of the people to be ignored, and the only way to do that is, presently the status quo is so far from wanting to drain the swamp that we knew \u2018the status quo has got to go.\u2019 I\u2019ve kinda been preaching that for a few decades now, ever since the little local city council seats that I was elected to, but I\u2019m not the only one who believes that, obviously,\u201d Palin said. \u201cPeople have faith in their own decision-making abilities for their families, for their businesses. They don\u2019t want some far-off politicians and bureaucrats making decisions for them. The only way to do that, to allow that independence and our priorities to be met, is to get rid of the people who want to control We the People,\u201d she contended. Marlow suggested Palin\u2019s nomination for Vice-President marked the beginning of the anti-establishment movement that culminated in the election of Donald Trump and Mike Pence. She modestly insisted that she didn\u2019t see herself that way, because she \u201cwonderfully, naively\u201d believed it was common sense to understand that the Constitution limits government and elevates the individual. \u201cI do think a lot of the Trump movement started in the Tea Party days, when enough people were saying \u2018enough,\u2019\u201d Palin said. \u201cBut see, the Establishment wouldn\u2019t listen, and they got worse since the Tea Party days. They got worse with shocking betrayals, and they literally doubled down on debt. They divided Americans. People started seeing, since the Tea Party days, how corruption in our government affects their lives. So they got worse, and they got cocky, but they also got caught, and we got stronger. \u2018Bigly,\u2019 as Trump would say \u2014 bigly stronger in these years since, and our grumbles, they grew into rumbles as we didn\u2019t divert our eyes from seeing the Naked Emperor. Now, during the Trump movement, enough people said \u2018enough.\u2019\u201d Palin saw Trump\u2019s Rust Belt victory as important because those states represent \u201cso much of America\u2019s heart, and our work ethic, and the unpretentious blue collar, pro-family, pro-God and guns and Constitution\u2026\u201d \u201cSo many Americans, like the people in the Rust Belt still, no matter where we live \u2013 in big cities, in tiny little villages \u2013 it\u2019s such a common theme. I think that\u2019s within all of our DNA,\u201d she said. \u201cLike I said, we can make our own decisions. Politicians, quit it. Quit making decisions for us.\u201d She recalled being surprised and \u201cticked off\u201d back in 2008 when the McCain campaign didn\u2019t make a serious effort in Michigan. \u201cI said, \u2018What do you mean, we\u2019re not going to Michigan? Every vote counts!\u2019\u201d she remembered, and was stunned to learn the campaign had \u201cessentially given up on the Rust Belt.\u201d \u201cThe people who build America, we\u2019re going to\u00a0give up on them? That\u2019s what it told me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried to get to Michigan anyway, but the McCain campaign, the people running that, they were a bunch of yahoos, to tell you the truth. I mean, they\u2019ve said enough bad things about me that I can finally be candid about who they are.\u201d Palin proudly recalled being \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d in 2008, as she \u201cspoke candidly about where America was headed \u2013 with our debt, with our ignoring the will of the people, in the Rust Belt and elsewhere.\u201d \u201cThe media was absolutely out of control with that herd mentality of corporate media, where one person jumped on a bandwagon of \u2018Oh, my goodness, she\u2019s so politically incorrect, we just don\u2019t understand her,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSo many of them jumped on that, and you know, it wasn\u2019t pleasant.\u201d Palin said the message of \u201cEnough!\u201d from the heartland was directed at corporate media, as well as government. \u201cWe knew we needed a revolution to change things, and we found our revolutionary, Donald Trump. He\u2019s our messenger,\u201d she said. \u201cDonald Trump heard the voice of the people, and allowed the people to expose what needed exposing, and he spoke it for us. That included a biased media. And we told corporate media over these years, \u2018Stop it, just stop it, or we will shut you down.\u2019 They were on trial, essentially \u2013 and they lost. And now this corporate media, and their exaggerations and their lies, and their politics of personal destruction, thank God they are irrelevant.\u201d Palin added that \u201cexposure of the political machines on both sides of the aisle\u201d helped push Middle America to the point of saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to\u00a0take it any more.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to take a stand for justice, for righteousness in our government. We\u2019re not going to take this corruption any more,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the enormous betrayals that Americans have gone through in these eight years, where we worked really hard to send reinforcements of commonsense Constitutional conservatives to Congress to clean things up, and quit raising the debt ceiling, and quit quantitative easing, allowing money to be printed out of nowhere, and devaluing our dollar, all these crazy things that were going on.\u201d \u201cWe worked hard to send those to the Senate, and to the House, to rein in an Administration that\u2019s obviously been out of control \u2013 and yet, too many of those politicians betrayed us. And after a couple of elections of being betrayed, people opened their eyes and they said, we don\u2019t have to take it any more,\u201d Palin declared. She\u00a0said that if Trump had not \u201ceked out\u201d a win in 2016, we would find ourselves \u201cin the throes of the fundamental transformation of America that candidate Barack Obama had promised that he was going to do to America, and it would be transformed into something that we don\u2019t recognize.\u201d \u201cWe would have seen, as you pointed out, no borders, and you don\u2019t have a nation if you have no borders,\u201d she told Marlow. \u201cYou would have seen that quashing of our freedom of speech. And even in the cultural aspect of what they were able to influence for too long, is that political correctness. If you were politically incorrect \u2013 according to their subjective, arbitrary double standards \u2013 you would be vilified, you would be ridiculed. Most people, they don\u2019t want to be vilified, they don\u2019t want to be ridiculed, so they start shutting down. They don\u2019t express their opinion any more.\u201d \u201cTalk about Rules for Radicals and Alinskyisms, Orwellian stuff, this is what happens when people start shutting down and not feeling free to express their diverse opinions in the cultural aspect,\u201d she continued. \u201cWell then, even legislatively, it becomes easier to start legislating against freedom of speech. And that\u2019s where they want to go. It\u2019s control of the people again. So thank God we won, and we\u2019re going to\u00a0have eight years to shore up the knowledge of the significance of our First Amendment rights and the Bill of Rights. I tell ya, we have to be so extremely thankful, because we knew America was at a crossroads. We knew we were going to go one way or the other.\u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.

      "author": "John Hayward",
      "content": " Marlow remarked that Palin was the focus of more hatred from the Left than anyone in American public life, at least until Donald Trump came along, and asked if she had any tips for dealing with left-wing bigotry. LISTEN:  She expressed sympathy for all those facing \u201cthe wrath of the whiners, the immature, those who are so intolerant that they can\u2019t accept another person\u2019s point of view or another person\u2019s vote.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together. We\u2019re like a family, and family circles the wagons, and that empowers us,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at Steve Bannon, what he\u2019s going through. The irony of Steve Bannon going through this hell with the politics of personal destruction that the Clinton machine supporters are throwing his way is, he recognized that in \u201808 what I was going through, and he made a movie about it,\u201d Palin said referring to Bannon\u2019s documentary\u00a0The Undefeated, which\u00a0chronicles\u00a0Palin\u2019s political career from a corruption busting Alaska mayor and governor to her vice presidential campaign as John McCain\u2019s running mate to her leadership in the Tea Party movement. \u201cPeople need to watch that, The Undefeated, because it wasn\u2019t about \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m the principal in the movie \u2013 but in that documentary it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about anybody who would face this injustice of the media, and the politics of personal destruction, and how you can use that actually as fuel,\u201d Palin said. \u201cWhen they throw that stuff at you \u2013 the lies and the exaggerations and ruining your reputation and your record \u2013 you know, it\u2019s kind of hard to find out where do you go to get back your reputation, after they do what they do to people they don\u2019t like. You have to personally use it as fuel to empower you, and to strengthen you, and to really allow it to be confirmation that you\u2019re right, because look at what it is that they represent,\u201d Palin explained. \u201cThey represent that intolerance. They represent very, very narrow-minded thinking. They don\u2019t want to enlarge any kind of tent. It\u2019s either their way or the highway.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what Steve Bannon is going through right now. But I guarantee you even he, as strong as he is, he\u2019s going to come out stronger,\u201d Palin anticipated. \u201cIt\u2019s going to help Trump, and it\u2019s going to help the nation. Matter of fact, despite how ugly and uncomfortable it is at the time, if you react to the circumstances that they\u2019re creating for you, it\u2019s going to\u00a0be even better for you. That\u2019s what Bannon will find out.\u201d She said Breitbart News has been attacked in a similar dishonest fashion by corporate media, but remained confident the public was too smart to be deceived. \u201cAll you have to do is log on to the Breitbart site and read what\u2019s written,\u201d Palin said. \u201cThese are good stories, good reports that allow the people to make up their minds. Whether they agree or disagree, they get to leave reading the article with information, and then leave it to them to make up their mind about it. Look at the authors, look at the bylines with each story. How diverse can you get?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a microcosm of America,\u201d she said of the diverse Breitbart News staff. At another point in the interview, Palin explained how Trump \u201cexposed\u201d the \u201cbiased media.\u201d \u201cThey were on trial, essentially \u2013 and they lost,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now this corporate media, and their exaggerations and their lies, and their politics of personal destruction, thank God they are irrelevant.\u201d She thought it was fair to ask if there should be career consequences for pundits and analysts who got everything wrong in the long prelude to the 2016 election, especially given their enthusiasm to \u201ccrucify those who get it right.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just accept that it\u2019s going to go on, and allow then our strength to be made manifest when we realize, okay, they\u2019re going to\u00a0keep getting it wrong, and they\u2019re going to keep trying to crucify us,\u201d she recommended. \u201cSo what? Life\u2019s not fair. There are more of us than there are of them. There really are.\u201d \u201cThey are very vocal, those who want to transform America and take away your freedom of speech. They\u2019re not the majority. The majority of Americans are right on target in where we want to go with liberty and all of our freedoms. So let\u2019s hang on to that, knowing that good, that\u2019s a tool for empowerment right there, is knowing what the numbers are,\u201d she urged.

      "author": "John Hayward",
      "content": " SirusXM host Alex Marlow asked Palin if she thought divine providence played a role in the election outcome. \u201cNo doubt, divine providence played a huge role in this election,\u201d she replied. \u201cI will boldly proclaim that. I saw it first-hand. I was there on the campaign trail. I saw how things were changing. I saw more and more people\u2019s eyes open, and I think so much of that was based on the church in general, those people of faith who were praying to God that people would wake up.\u201d LISTEN:  \u201cRemember, our Founders dedicated this land, this new country that would be America, this idea of America, dedicated it to God,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cIf I were President, I\u2019d re-dedicate us to God. When I was governor I proclaimed that, the state of Alaska, this is yours, Lord. May your will be done here. We need to do that again in America.\u201d \u201cPrayer warriors across the country, people who perhaps had never expressed their faith in a higher being before, knew that Jeez, we got to\u00a0be on our knees asking for a change here, because we\u2019re going down the wrong road. I was so grateful to see so many people step up in that realm,\u201d Palin said. She added a personal note, something she said she\u2019s never talked about in public before: \u201cI was very grateful to see that the church stepped up, because eight years ago, I felt that they didn\u2019t. Besides the attacks on my family and supporters, the most hurtful thing about the election, the vilification, the marginalization, the ridicule that hit us \u2013 my family and me, eight years ago \u2013 was that I didn\u2019t feel that the church did circle the wagons and step up boldly and say, \u2018What? No, that\u2019s not what she\u2019s saying,\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s not what she represents.\u2019 Because some of them knew me.\u201d \u201cA lot of these famous pastors, and people all over the country, right after the election were sending me their secret confidential little love notes about, \u2018Oh, you know, my heart was with ya, and you know if there\u2019s ever anything I can do for you, just let me know, because I believe in you, and I believed in you during the election, I\u2019m so sorry what you went through.\u2019 And would sit there reading this stuff, saying, \u2018Well, where were you? Why didn\u2019t you step up? You\u2019re going to\u00a0have to step up next time, or that next person is going to\u00a0go down too,\u201d she remembered sadly. \u201cSo yes, thank God. Literally, I\u2019m thanking God that this go-around, enough pastors, enough congregations, enough people who don\u2019t even ever get in the four walls of a church, but know there is greater purpose in our lives and there is a greater being who has everything in His hands \u2014 more of the Church stepped up, prayed about this very hard (and they need to keep praying about it). They did their job,\u201d Palin concluded. She thought it was fair to ask if there should be career consequences for pundits and analysts who got everything wrong in the long prelude to the 2016 election, especially given their enthusiasm to \u201ccrucify those who get it right.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just accept that it\u2019s going to go on, and allow then our strength to be made manifest when we realize, okay, they\u2019re going to\u00a0keep getting it wrong, and they\u2019re going to keep trying to crucify us,\u201d she recommended. \u201cSo what?

      "subtitle": "On a special holiday edition of Breitbart News Daily, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin reflected on her experiences in the 2008 presidential campaign, her life after politics, the incoming Trump administration, and the role she might play in the years ahead.",
      "author": "John Hayward",
      "content": " Palin found some humor in the way liberals called her \u201csexist,\u201d even though she argued she is \u201cone of the most genuine feminists that ever can be, and that is truly believing that God\u2019s created us equal.\u201d LISTEN:  SiriusXM host Alex Marlow noted that Palin\u2019s 2008 candidacy inspired many women, including his wife, to shift to the Republican Party precisely because Palin offers a real example of what women can accomplish \u2013 unlike Hillary Clinton, who \u201cis where she is because she married a powerful man.\u201d Palin said it was \u201cvery cool\u201d to hear that about Marlow\u2019s wife. \u201cThat just makes my day,\u201d she said, a wee bit tearfully. \u201cI just love hearing that. Thank you!\u201d She added the observation that Hillary Clinton \u201cstood by a cheating man\u201d to the critique of Clinton\u2019s position at the head of politicized feminism. \u201cI\u2019d have none of that,\u201d Palin declared firmly. \u201cWhat they have created, unfortunately, is this message to little girls, young women, that they need Big Daddy Government to provide for them, that they\u2019re incapable of providing for themselves, being independent, and pulling themselves up from the bootstraps and making it,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s so unfortunate, and it\u2019s the antithesis, really, of feminism and understanding equal rights. It\u2019s just such a ruse.\u201d \u201cAnd yeah, Hillary\u2019s been a part of that, so those who want government to pay for their cell phone, and their birth control, and their housing, and everything else \u2013 and particularly they push so hard for women to receive a lot of gimmes, even though if they\u2019re able-bodied they can get out there and work for it like the rest of us do. They\u2019re sending that message that I\u2019m afraid would make young women feel like, \u2018Oh, well if our leaders are saying that, I am just a little girl here who can\u2019t make it on my own. I guess I need Big Daddy Government.\u2019 So that\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d she said. Marlow asked if Palin would consider a post in the Trump administration such as secretary of the interior, given her experience with energy and environmental issues as Governor of Alaska. \u201cI told Mr. Trump early, early on that I\u2019m a believer that you don\u2019t need a title, and you don\u2019t need an office to make a difference,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m sincere. I told him that, and maybe he\u2019s taking it absolutely literally, and I\u2019m not offered a post \u2013 which, however it goes, is fine with me. I just voted for him to be the leader of the free world, our President, so I trust him to build a team that works for him.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s going to\u00a0have good people around him to change policy that has been shoved down America\u2019s throat, unfairly and unconstitutionally, and that is going to do wonders for, not just our psyche, but our economy, practical things, and national security. The things that Trump and his team will be able to undo, and then the things that he will be able to do, that he has promised to do \u2013 it\u2019s all good,\u201d she predicted. Palin said Trump has \u201calready showed us that he\u2019s going to hit the ground running, and he\u2019s done that through this record-setting transition team process that he\u2019s going through.\u201d \u201cWe need that, we expect that. We expect no betrayals,\u201d she said. \u201cNo betrayals this time. America can\u2019t take another political betrayal. So the things that have been promised, we voted for them, we expect them, and we are going to\u00a0hold everybody\u2019s feet to the fire \u2013 everybody on that team, the President included. And I say this with all due respect, but it\u2019s going to\u00a0be our job as voters to hold everybody accountable.\u201d \u201cWhat I expect in the first hundred days is implementation of policies that will undo this administration that had operated independent of the electorate, like with Obamacare, and with the omnibus, and those things that Congress actually capitulated on, and allowed Barack Obama to do to us,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the first hundred days, Trump can undo what the administration had done unconstitutionally.\u201d Palin further argued that agencies like the IRS which have been \u201cweaponized against us, against We the People \u2013 no more of that. In the first hundred days, he can do whatever needs to be done to take those weapons away from our own government agencies, who seek to harm the people.\u201d Marlow asked about the Palin family\u2019s Thanksgiving traditions. Palin said one of them was, \u201cWe go around the room \u2013 and it\u2019s a big room by now, with a big growing family \u2013 and I ask everybody, what are you thankful for, and what do you want to do to make the world a better place in the coming year?\u201d \u201cI know that, I think 100 percent\u00a0of the family members this go-around are going to say they\u2019re very thankful that the people elected Donald Trump. We feel more secure,\u201d she said. She said the Palin family would be obliged by a combination of home remodeling and the quest for better winter sports conditions to drive a few hours from home for the holiday. When Marlow asked what they usually discuss during Thanksgiving, she gave the quintessential Alaskan answer: \u201csnow.\u201d \u201cWe talk about how lucky we are to live in this paradise, where we get to get out and enjoy God\u2019s green earth, or in our case God\u2019s white earth,\u201d she said joyfully. \u201cThe natural resources that we have all around us in Alaska! Alaska is so doggone blessed, because we get to look outside our window and say, \u2018Yes, the hand of God is here. Look at the majesty all around us!\u2019 We\u2019re all very thankful for that. I\u2019m very grateful that even the littlest ones in our family realize how different it is up here, culturally and resource-wise, how rich this place is. I\u2019m sure everybody will express some appreciation for that, too.\u201d Inspired by Marlow\u2019s comment that everyone needs to get off the grid, especially after such an acrimonious election season, Palin said she would add a new tradition this year: a Thanksgiving bucket, into which all guests would be required to deposit their cell phones until dinner was over. \u201cThat doggone phone\u2019s always in my hands, too,\u201d she confessed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t good, and that\u2019s not how we were created. Technology is so wonderful, but it can be used for evil or for good. We have to make sure we\u2019re not crossing that line.\u201d She said her husband Todd was her best teacher on this point because \u201che despises the cell phone,\u201d and is perhaps even \u201ca little bit harsh, but really good\u201d at reminding his family to \u201cput the damn phone away and get outside and play.\u201d Palin said her family has been doing great, celebrating the wedding of her daughter Bristol to Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer as a particular highlight. She lauded Meyer as \u201ca very smart young man and politically astute, very impassioned about America,\u201d and \u201cjust such a wonderful addition to the family.\u201d When Marlow asked if Meyer might one day have a political career, she said \u201che does have a political future if he would choose to do such a thing, he\u2019d be good for the country.\u201d She recommended him for \u201cgovernor of Kentucky, if not Alaska, because he\u2019s from Kentucky.\u201d \u201cI tell him all the time, you don\u2019t want to be in the Senate do you? Because unless you have a President you can work with, and team members all around you, reinforcements all around you, you\u2019re going to\u00a0be beating your head against the wall,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s so America First, unless he has colleagues agreeing to that, I think he\u2019d be pulling his hair out.\u201d As for herself, she wryly noted that \u201ctransition meetings are going on in New York, while I\u2019m on the other side of the world,\u201d so the likelihood of an appointment to the Trump Administration seemed minimal. \u201cIt goes without saying that family will be first,\u201d Palin declared. \u201cBut then I want to help people like you, Alex, and those who work for outlets that don\u2019t want to be a part of this corporate media that has so adversely affected truth and the things that America stands for. It\u2019s been so bad what this unjust media has done to the country. So for those of you who are working so hard to tell the truth, I will be a part of that somehow.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s funny that politics and the media, the two most influential aspects of society \u2013 also the most controversial aspects of society, I believe \u2013 they\u2019ve been in my heart since I was a little girl,\u201d she reflected. \u201cI always wanted to be a sports reporter. I always wanted to do the news. When I was a little kid, I think there was one woman sports reporter at the time, Willow Bay, I\u2019ll never forget her. And I always wanted to do something in politics. That just grows as a passion in me. It\u2019s not diminished at all. So somehow touching both is what I will do.\u201d At the moment, she still named Facebook as the primary venue for her writing, although she allowed that she doesn\u2019t like \u201cdriving traffic to Mark Zuckerberg.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t like that for years, but that\u2019s been the best format for us, for now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m working to change that. I don\u2019t like driving that traffic, and the revenue, to Zuckerberg\u2019s people there on Facebook, knowing that that money will go to liberal causes that try to undo everything that we\u2019re doing. So we\u2019re working on getting away from Facebook.\u201d Having said that, she added \u201cI am a believer in preaching outside of the choir,\u201d and \u201cinfiltrating and influencing pop culture.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why Todd and I, we haven\u2019t hesitated doing some of the reality-type shows or hits that we\u2019ve done because it\u2019s like, hey, this is another reason why Donald Trump won. People knew him through pop culture,\u201d Palin observed. \u201cPop culture, as Andrew Breitbart used to say, is downstream from politics. So Donald Trump was able to tap into that \u2026 one of the elements of the perfect storm that he is was already his notoriety and his influence on pop culture. That was one of the things that he brought to the table that certainly I recognized early on, and said yep, he\u2019s the one, because he taps into the pop culture thinking.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us should hesitate to be a part of that, if we\u2019re going to\u00a0do it for good,\u201d she advised her fellow conservatives.

This person was \u201can outsider,\u201d someone who was \u201cnot part of the political establishment,\u201d \u201cnot for sale,\u201d with \u201can \u2018America First\u2019 foreign policy approach\u201d and \u201ca \u2018Drain the Swamp\u2019 mentality about Washington, DC.\u201d What Bannon loved most was how this person seemed to \u201cput the American worker\u2014the little guy\u2014first.\u201d Except Bannon wasn\u2019t thinking about Donald Trump. The dream candidate he had in mind? Sarah Palin. Years before the partisan provocateur of the 2016 cycle hitched himself to the upstart populist billionaire from New York, Bannon openly fantasized about transforming the former governor of Alaska into the very kind of anti-politician who could humiliate the elites of both parties, the very kind of norm-defying outsider that Trump, with Bannon\u2019s help, would ultimately prove to be. So he put all his energy into helping the self-described Mama Grizzly eat Washington\u2019s lunch. This was back in 2011 and Bannon, a filmmaker whose credits at the time included an homage to Ronald Reagan and two films on the Tea Party movement, told the National Review that he saw \u201ca direct lineage\u201d between the Tea Party movement and the Reagan Revolution, and he was desperate to find a contemporary Reagan. For Bannon, the upcoming 2012 election was an opportunity to \u201cfight for the soul of the Republican Party.\u201d He told an audience in Chicago in July of that year, \u201cIf we want to get eviscerated and have another 2008, all we have to do is run an establishment Republican.\u201d It was just a few months earlier that Rebecca Mansour, currently the Senior West Coast Editor at Breitbart News and previously an aide and speechwriter to Sarah Palin, reached out to Bannon to ask if he would make some short videos for a potential Palin presidential campaign. Mansour told Politico recently that Bannon was enthusiastic about her boss\u2019s potential candidacy; it was Bannon, she said, who identified Palin as an \u201coutsider\u201d with a \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d mentality. Bannon saw in Palin someone who, in his own words, presented \u201can existential threat to not just the progressive left, but also to the entrenched country club Republican Party.\u201d Read the rest here.",

      "content": " \u201cNails\u201d speaks from the heart. He doesn\u2019t hold back. Perhaps that\u2019s why he likes Donald Trump and Sarah Palin. Those unafraid to be politically incorrect have a certain kinship nowadays. This week, Dykstra spoke his mind on the President-elect, the former governor of Alaska, tobacco, baseball, his new book, and much more. If we learned nothing else, we know this much\u2013\u201cNails\u201d still has the swagger and bravado he had all those years ago when winning the World Series in New York and another pennant in Philadelphia. While appearing on The Palin Update on Mama Grizzly Radio, Dykstra opened up about politics and our national pastime He also got very personal speaking about his ex-wife and very provocative when speaking about Darryl Strawberry\u2019s anatomy. Dykstra covered a lot, much like he used to cover so much ground in centerfield. While flying on a plane, Dykstra watched the votes come in on Election Night. The former Amazin\u2019 was amazed by Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton. \u201cThat was one of the most exciting (things) just because of the way he was supposed to lose by so many votes,\u201d Dykstra said. That\u2019s saying something, coming from a man who played in the Buckner game. He knows all about exciting events. And just like the Mets-Red Sox World Series, the presidential race turned out favorably. \u201cHe\u2019s the right person to run the country,\u201d added Dykstra. \u201cI mean, she\u2019s not. She wasn\u2019t.\u201d As far as Dykstra is concerned, America made the best choice last month. \u201cBottom line is, Trump\u2019s a respected businessman,\u201d said Dykstra. \u201cThe reality is, if you\u2019re running the country, it\u2019s all about relationships and your teammates. So what\u2019s going to be interesting to me is to see who he surrounds himself with.\u201d Perhaps Sarah Palin would be an asset to the new administration, someone Dykstra respects a \u201ctremendous amount\u201d, calling her a \u201cclass act\u201d. \u201cNails\u201d still holds Davey Johnson largely at fault for the Mets only winning one world title in the 1980s. He points to his triple in the ninth inning in Game 6 against Houston in the NLCS as his defining moment. He says he\u2019s still cool with Strawberry and Dwight Gooden. And he thinks Major League Baseball is going soft. When asked about the new rule that will ban tobacco products for incoming MLB players, Dykstra wonders if we\u2019re not too far from seeing guys having \u201ccookies and milk\u201d in the dugout. Baseball runs in the family, with two of Dykstra\u2019s sons currently playing professionally. But, the grand old game needs a jolt in some aspects if you ask the man who played the sport with all his heart and soul. \u201cWhen I played, if you talked to the other team, we\u2019re fighting,\u201d Dykstra said. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for real money. It\u2019s not a joke. I gotta feed my family. So the bottom line is, you don\u2019t talk to the other team. I see them all laughing with each other now. They all go to Sunday brunch together.\u201d It\u2019s a gentler game compared to when the man known as \u201cNails\u201d played it. The 1986 Mets\u00a0had a reputation\u00a0as\u00a0a wild bunch on and off the field. Dykstra recalls those days fondly and he\u2019s still as unfiltered now as he was then. Maybe more so. Dykstra\u2019s book, House Of Nails is available everywhere. The former big leaguer wrote the memoir himself, after he couldn\u2019t see eye to eye with a potential ghost writer. On The Palin Update, Dykstra also discusses his thoughts on Bryce Harper, the key to playing winning baseball, steroids, and what could have made him move to Somalia. It\u2019s unfiltered and very interesting, just like Dykstra himself. To hear the complete interview with Lenny Dykstra visit www.mamagrizzlyradio.com",

      "author": "Kevin Scholla",
      "content": " This past Thursday, Sarah Palin attended the Thursday Night Football game between the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks. Her husband Todd, as well as best-selling author Debbie Macomber and others accompanied the former Alaska governor at CenturyLink Field, to watch the NFC West tilt. Seems pretty pedestrian. But while the Seahawks wore \u201cAction Green\u201d uniforms as part of the NFL\u2019s Color Rush, some in the media saw red over Palin daring to have an opinion on just about anything. It\u2019s all part of the media\u2019s continued unnecessary roughness. For Palin\u2019s part, she had a blast. She posted pictures all over social media. She even got to chat pre-game with Seattle assistant coach and fellow Idaho Vandal Tom Cable. Seemingly just a normal American woman enjoying the American spectacle that is pro football. But, the media pounced harder than the Legion of Boom. Palin\u2019s football fandom was questioned by the Seattle Times. The headline read \u2018Sarah Palin is apparently a Seahawks fan and is in attendance for Thursday Night Football\u2019. Well, they got one thing right. Palin was there. But, \u201capparently\u201d a Seahawks fan? What is that about? So the woman who made up a Trump-fueled, anti-Muslim attack was instantly believable. Hillary Clinton\u2019s countless lies were given a free pass. Yet, the same media just can\u2019t fathom Governor Palin likes one of the 32 NFL franchises, particularly the one closest to her home. Got it. In the piece, written by an author who bashes Trump and Palin repeatedly on Twitter, and printed in a pro-Obama and pro-Kaepernick paper, we can find the following passage, \u201cMore importantly: Is this a longterm infatuation, or is Palin just another bandwagoner?\u201d Provacative stuff. Back in the old days, journalists used to actually find out the answers instead of just posing the questions. Very minimal digging could have given us the answer on Palin\u2019s football leanings. Not surprising, this same nonsensical piece jumped the gun on another part of the story, leading to a printed retraction. In the initial article, the Seattle Times reported Palin had a police escort to the game and tied up traffic. Untrue. The escort was for the Seahawks team bus. While the paper later admitted the mistake, thousands already read the erroneous report painting Palin as a privileged politician taking advantage of public servants for her own pleasure. She is nothing of the sort. She fights that garbage. The reporter should have verified this before the rag ran it, plain and simple. Like the OSU terrorist labeled a \u201cgunman\u201d by so many media outlets before they figured out he never had a gun, the Seattle Times jumped the gun on this one, hoping to take a shot at Palin. As to the theory of Palin\u00a0as a fairweather Johnson when it comes to her sports teams, think again. Palin is a huge sports fan. That trait runs in the family. Chuck Heath Sr., her dad, coached track. Palin\u2019s brother, Chuck Jr. played football at Idaho. Todd Palin is a championship snow machine driver. Palin, herself, played on a state championship basketball team, known as \u2018Sarah Barracuda\u2019 for her tenacious defense. All\u00a0of the Palin clan\u00a0agree on a passion for athletics. The difference lies in NFL alliances. Family ties to the Green Bay Packers go way back. Chuck Heath Sr. played high school football with Green Bay great Jerry Kramer in Sandpoint, Idaho. After graduation, Heath followed Kramer\u2019s career with the Pack. Chuck Heath Jr. also became a Packer backer. During the Seahawks 2013 Super Bowl run, the Palins showed their true colors. Governor Palin, Todd, and children Piper and Trig are card carrying members of the Seattle Seahawks Fan Club. Palin posted a picture online of their membership cards. So, while the Heaths bleed Green and Gold, the Palins prefer the College Navy, Action Green, and Wolf Grey of the Seahawks. Now, to address our Seattle scribe\u2019s allegations directly. Sarah Palin\u2019s support of the Seahawks didn\u2019t start with the club\u2019s recent success. Back in 2008 when Palin ran for veep, she proudly proclaimed herself a Seahawker even with the team in the midst of a dreadful 4-12 campaign. Palin has rooted for the Hawks for a long time. A loyal bunch, those Palins. Unlike Palin, many politicians change their sports affiliations as much as they waffle on the issues. Hillary Clinton is a Chicago Cubs fan when it helps her politically, then dons a New York Yankees cap the next day. Barack Obama suddenly became Mr. Chicago sports. Even though he grew up in Hawaii and didn\u2019t hit Illinois until already an adult, Obama claims he\u2019s a Bears, Bulls, and White Sox die-hard. The only thing that died hard was the first pitches Obama has thrown out over the last eight years. In mom jeans and all, Obama\u2019s pitching style alone has proven his phoniness when it comes to sports. His infamous poor shooting performances included a 2-22 showing while trying to promote Obamacare and an 0-4 showing in front of kids during an Easter party. You want sports frauds? Here they are. Neither one is named Palin. Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie have also stayed true to their squads. While Mayor of New York City, Giuliani was an outspoken Yankees fan, even though he presided over a city that the New York Mets also call home. Christie, who is a Mets fan, also loves the Dallas Cowboys. Despite being governor of New Jersey, the Jets, Giants, and Eagles lose out to Jerry Jones\u2019 franchise. Not only Republicans stay\u00a0true blue when it comes to sports. Ex-New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg is a Mets guy. His stance on sugary drinks may be ridiculous but his honesty when it comes to baseball is admirable. While it is only sports, it is also telling. If someone is so wishy washy about entertainment, why should they be trusted when it comes to serious topics? The media however continues to reward deceit and dishonesty while they attack those they despise no matter the situation. False allegations of racism and sexism against Donald Trump were printed as fact. Wild lies about Palin have been printed as well. But, something so ridiculous as which team someone roots for is met with skepticism, all because those writing such trash are still so upset over Hillary\u2019s epic loss. In front of Palin and 69,066 others, the Seahawks clobbered the Rams and clinched a division crown, all while wearing jerseys and pants that looked radioactive. But those Color Rush unis don\u2019t have anything on the poisonous venom the media still spews at Sarah Palin and freedom loving Americans everywhere.",

Palin said it was unnecessary for the United States to import the dysfunctional bureaucracy of the United Nations since homegrown bureaucracy is already doing such a good job of messing up American life. \u201cThey can spy from anywhere, so they don\u2019t need to be right underfoot, the UN, for us to spy on them. We\u2019ll know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d she jovially assured Kassam. \u201cUnfortunately, the UN\u2019s presence even, in the U.S. \u2013 all that has done is said to people like John Kerry and his desire to essentially cave to other countries, he essentially is inviting other countries to exercise veto power over us, over U.S. national security measures,\u201d Palin continued on a more serious note. \u201cHe said during a debate some years ago, he said that our security measures must pass a \u2018global test.\u2019 So the presence of the UN here, unfortunately, just creates more fertile ground for leftist globalists like John Kerry to grow in their desire to make the U.S. continue to fund the lion\u2019s share of this globalist circus \u2013 where bad players, including dictators, they\u2019re going to keep griping, and complaining, and whining, and attacking us for not bending over backwards enough for their liking. Unfortunately, that\u2019s what the UN presence here has been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does it say about the United States in 2016, at the tail end of 2016, that you have an administration not just willing to stab one of its most important global allies, Israel, in the front, but is being led, supposedly \u2013 listen, I\u2019m going by what they\u2019re saying; they said they didn\u2019t lead, so they have to have been led \u2013 by countries like Venezuela?\u201d Kassam asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a great point,\u201d Palin replied. \u201cI don\u2019t think people have been understanding that \u2013 that either our leaders, unfortunately, are caught lying in regards to orchestrating this non-supportive measure \u2013 to say the least \u2013 of Israel, or yeah, we\u2019ve been led by bad characters that certainly do not have America\u2019s nor Israel\u2019s interests at heart.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of Israel, it\u2019s almost laughable, if it weren\u2019t so dangerous, that the Left now is so obsessed with national borders, obsessed with Israel\u2019s borders,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cTheir defense of what they have just done, in stabbing Israel, is based on their supposed desire to see borders enforced. Since when? They never have seemed to understand the concern that we have, nor the purpose of a nation\u2019s borders. They don\u2019t care about America\u2019s porous borders continuing as is.\u201d Palin said there were two ways to look at how the incoming Trump administration should handle the United Nations. \u201cOne is, I called for our next president, Donald Trump, to call for the unshackling of the political bands tying us to the UN,\u201d she said. \u201cBy exiting the UN, where injustice is actually rewarded, we then will be able to uphold America\u2019s reputation as the leader, and as the kind and compassionate and generous nation that we are \u2013 as the nation sharing values that, when emulated by any other nation, can bring justice and equal rights to any other nation.\u201d \u201cSo I call upon President-elect Trump to lead that charge. But the other way to look at this is, is it really going to be one person, one leader\u2019s responsibility to do so? Or is this going to be part of the revolution that we have just seen, that did elect Trump?\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s We the People needing to step up and do it. It\u2019s our government. It\u2019s our money funding the lion\u2019s share of the globalist circus. It\u2019s We the People needing to rise up and make this a part of the revolution that we have just so benefited from.\u201d Palin said this urgent need for the people to regain control of national affairs was her most important message at the close of 2016. \u201cOur government, our bureaucrats and our elected leaders, work for us,\u201d she stressed. \u201cWe are the ones that need to call for this, that the UN shackles be next on the chopping block.\u201d \u201cThings that have really resonated with me and I\u2019m sure so many other Americans \u2013 remember back some years ago, when our troops were required to wear the UN insignia on our U.S. uniforms in the military, how really appalling that was?\u201d she recalled. \u201cBecause we know what it is that our troops and our vets have sacrificed for, in order to put America first, so that we can be that bright shining light \u2013 all the good things that America is for the world.\u201d \u201cTo have symbolically an insignia even on our uniforms required, sends that message or paints that picture that we are underneath globalist rule,\u201d Palin argued. \u201cThings like that resonate with me, and I think other average everyday Americans. Things like that are really coming to the forefront now. We\u2019re remembering those things. We\u2019re understanding that there is something we can do about this, in directing our government to get out of an organization that would require such a thing.\u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.

      "subtitle": "While many celebrity deaths grabbed the headlines in 2016, we\u2019ve also lost others whose names may not be as well known, but who have had an incredible impact on so many. One of those people is Doug McMarlin. The world of politics will never be the same after McMarlin\u2019s passing in December.",
      "author": "Kevin Scholla",
      "content": " McMarlin was a world class political consultant. He worked alongside the likes of President George W. Bush, Mrs. Laura Bush, Senator John McCain, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, Ohio Governor John Kasich, and several others. Politically he was a smashing success. People are certainly remembering him for his professionalism. But most are missing McMarlin because of the man he was.  Those who knew him best are describing him as generous, kind, loving, loyal, sensitive, and even gorgeous. McMarlin\u2019s humor and big heart are also a recurring theme if you talk to his friends and colleagues. \u201cDoug was one of the funniest people I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d said Matt Borges, Ohio\u2019s GOP chairman. \u201cSmart, talented, and an exceptional advance man and political expert. Better yet, he was a kind and devoted friend. Every time we talked he\u2019d ask about my family. Some of my favorite memories, professionally and personally, are with him. Everyone who knew Doug, liked him. That\u2019s rare. It\u2019s even rarer to find a person who lived as joyfully as Doug did.\u201d Like Borges, many friends considered McMarlin so much more. He was family. He was a brother. Reagan White House veteran and SarahPAC Treasurer Tim Crawford told Breitbart News McMarlin was the total package. \u201cI lost a dear friend, a brother in arms,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cDoug\u2019s humor, outlook on life, and our frequent conversations will be what I will miss most of all.\u201d While McMarlin made his mark all over the United States, not to mention overseas, his ties to Ohio were Buckeye strong. McMarlin grew up there and graduated from The Ohio State University. He even served as a board member for the Columbus Zoo. His favorite animal though was his beloved French Bulldog, Emerson. Outside of Ohio, McMarlin was received just as well. \u201cDoug McMarlin was a friend, colleague, and also a very bright light in the national political landscape,\u201d said Susan Combs, the former Texas State comptroller. \u201cHe had an acute ear for political trends across America, as well as a refreshing and singular warmth and kindness. I really miss him.\u201d Karen Rosalie Giorno was a political colleague and a friend of McMarlin\u2019s for over 25 years. They worked for several presidents, traveled the world together, and helped get candidates elected. She loved him like a brother. In fact, McMarlin moved to Florida in 2015 so the two could be closer to each other. Not only would this give them a chance to socialize more but they even discussed combining their consulting practices in order to work full time together. \u201cDoug was a scholar and a gentleman,\u201d Giorno said. \u201cHe was one of a kind; unique in his zest for life; his insatiable appetite for getting to the heart of things, always asking questions. I loved his intellectual curiosity, his boyish playfulness, his heartfelt laugh, and his joyful led nature. Yet he also had a serious side and was passionate about his work and the people that mattered to him. He was an amazing person, an amazing friend-he was, part of my family. His contribution to the world and the people around him will stand the test of time. I miss him every day, and his passing has left a giant sized hole that will never be filled.\u201d The Palin camp was hit hard by the loss of McMarlin. Not only are the Palins themselves grieving but those who have worked for the former Alaska governor are particularly shaken. Palin team member Jason Recher, a former Special Assistant to President George W. Bush worked with McMarlin for over 16 years in various capacities all over the world from Alaska to Moscow to London to Hong Kong. He remembers McMarlin as special and unique. \u201cDoug McMarlin wore several hats in my life \u2013 friend, groomsman, business partner \u2013 but brother is what sums it up best,\u201d Recher said. \u201cTogether, we accomplished great things professionally but personally he was always there to serve as a listening ear, a compass, or comedian. Doug McMarlin was an original, one of a kind \u2013 he\u2019ll be tremendously missed and never replaced.\u201d Palin herself is reflecting on her times with McMarlin. \u201cDoug was one of the most talented strategic communicators on the national scene,\u201d Palin told Breitbart News. \u201cHis signature touch was a covert, brilliant use of humor and clever sarcasm that alleviated much of the stress in the bizarre situations we\u2019ve encountered. He and a couple more of us always talked about writing a book or screenplay about what our team\u2019s encountered, but I doubt people could even believe most of it! Still, I wish we would have done more than just talk about how we wanted to share some unbelievable times. Doug helped get us through them with grins on our faces, and the rest of America could benefit from what we\u2019ve learned in what we wanted to title, \u2018The New Normal\u2019.\u201d McMarlin\u2019s relationship with Palin and her family dates back to the Mama Grizzly\u2019s historic run on a national ticket. \u201cDoug started with our team on the \u201908 Vice Presidential trail, quickly becoming my and my family\u2019s true friend,\u201d said Palin. \u201cMy kids loved him.\u201d Palin also appreciated McMarlin\u2019s accomplishments before she met him. \u201cBefore that, Doug proved his incredible dedication to public service as a veteran of both Bush 41 & 43 White House teams, and had served in the Ohio Governor\u2019s cabinet,\u201d Palin said. Doug was the resident expert on all-things Buckeye. Working all hours, everyday, across all these time zones in which our small crew operates, Doug kept us informed so we wouldn\u2019t miss a beat\u2026 and in fact often let us beat the rapid news cycle. We practiced citizen journalism before citizen journalism was cool! Personally, my family and I will miss Doug tremendously; his laugh, his ability to make everyone else laugh, his love and protection of our children \u2013 those gifts can not be replaced.\u201d Georgia loved Doug McMarlin too. Georgia Godfrey that is. \u201cNo matter where we were in the world, I laughed with Doug McMarlin,\u201d said Godfrey, Chief of Staff to Secretary Condoleezza Rice. \u201cOur work was sometimes hard and maddening but Doug, through his wit, taught me to see the humor in everything. Doug was a mentor to me but most importantly, he was my friend \u2014 a friend, who will be sorely missed.\u201d North Carolina State Senator Deanna Ballard worked with McMarlin on various trips with President and Mrs. Bush and Governor Palin dating back to 2003. She remembers all of those trips fondly. \u201cDoug could extinguish any heat in an argument with his quick wit and cheeky smile \u2013 he always put others at ease, was fiercely loyal, a team player, always focused on getting the job done and lived with a sincere and genuine affection for people,\u201d Ballard said. \u201cIf he were a photograph, he would be seen in the background \u2013 not the foreground. He would be standing in a warm light that would complement his rich smile and bright eyes all framed by solid arms that could push anything forward. He would be unassuming by his posture, but never dull in presence because he always lived in color.\u201d North of the border, McMarlin is missed as well. Jeremy Hunt met McMarlin in 2008 during the North American Leaders\u2019 Summit in New Orleans; the last such meeting hosted by President Bush before he left office. He made quite the impression. Hunt, now the managing director of Harper and Associates; a consulting group former Prime Minister Stephen Harper founded following his departure from public office, told Breitbart News that McMarlin was the real deal. \u201cDoug was a polished, articulate professional who never pulled a punch or a punch line with me,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cHe represented the President of the United States with class and was a tremendous personal ambassador for the American people to our team of Canadian politicos. Those who have worked in campaigns, politics and government know how much easier and enjoyable the work becomes when you undertake it with people who are competent, reliable and funny. Often, you are stuck working with people who have none of these qualities. So when you meet someone like Doug, who has all of this and more, you immediately make note, because they so rarely come along. His loss will be most acutely by his family and loved ones. But make no mistake, conservatives across the U.S. and Canada will feel his loss for years to come as they proceed into electoral battle without his wisdom, insight or experienced counsel.\u201d Doug McMarlin was a friend of Canada and conservatives the world over. He will be missed by many Canadian conservatives who had the pleasure of working with him and like Hunt, the honor of calling him a friend. While McMarlin\u2019s work in politics is what he may be best known for, he touched the lives of many in the entertainment industry as well. Major Nashville public relations executive Kirt Webster is mourning the loss. \u201cI was saddened to hear of the passing of Doug McMarlin,\u201d Webster said. \u201cI had the opportunity and honor to work with Doug on various occasions and he was always the consummate professional. It is not easy, although it might look it sometimes, to handle logistics for government officials with various layers of associates tied to one event, but Doug always made it look easy and with a smile on his face. I worked with Doug on advancing several celebrity campaign events including ones with Hank Williams Jr., Lee Greenwood, and Big & Rich, and adding those logistics to an already hectic schedule was not an easy task. However, our experiences were always first class and without drama. Doug will be missed, not just by his friends in the government sector, but also the entertainment sector.\u201d High praise is rolling in from all circles. When McMarlin died he was only 48-years old. Too soon for sure, but it\u2019s unanimous that he packed a lot of life into those four-plus decades. McMarlin played a pivotal role in the Bush 43 era. He was part of the campaign team for both of George W. Bush\u2019s presidential campaigns, managing national media logistics in 2000 and directing major event logistics and media in multiple battleground states in 2004. McMarlin was appointed to the staff of both Presidential Inaugural Committees. Throughout President Bush\u2019s two terms, McMarlin served as one of a select group of individuals who traveled on behalf of Bush in advance of both foreign and domestic mission. He coordinated between the White House, local governments, national press corps, and foreign diplomats and the heads of government and state. McMarlin managed events across the globe and was a key leader in each of Bush\u2019s visits to the United Kingdom, including the historic State Visit of 2003. His resume is one for the books, figuratively and literally. McMarlin created and managed national book tours for Bush as well as Sarah Palin. He was responsible for the public roll out strategy of Palin\u2019s Going Rogue \u2013 An American Life and Bush\u2019s Decision Points, the two top-selling non-fiction books of 2009 and 2010. Whatever McMarlin touched was a hit. The senior vice president of Harper Collins Tina Andreadis remembers McMarlin as a \u201cgorgeous person\u201d. \u201cHe was instrumental in the launch of Sarah Palin\u2019s Going Rogue \u2013 and other subsequent projects,\u201d Andreadis said. \u201cHis wit, intelligence and humor is unmatched. I miss him dearly.\u201d She has a lot of company. While McMarlin was a whiz with media, he interestingly enough was not a fan of social media. At least not for his personal use. Hysterically funny and often loud, McMarlin was also private. He helped others excel in the limelight rather than crave it for himself. He loved all things British. An Anglophile to the core, McMarlin handled every visit President Bush took to Great Britain \u2013 including the State Visit at Buckingham Palace and more private events such as a concert performed by Andrew Lloyd Webber at Winfield House with Ambassador Robert Tuttle. McMarlin loved music. From Sinatra to Fleetwood Mac, he took his tunes seriously. He consumed both books and movies \u2013 and had a titanic sized personal DVD collection. His main interest was simply knowledge. A walking Trivial Pursuit game, McMarlin knew the most obscure, random, fascinating facts from history. Above all though, he loved his country, his friends, and his family. Doug McMarlin is survived by his husband, Nick. Many are reminiscing about the amazing Christmas and Halloween parties the couple would throw. Always concerned for others, McMarlin would make sure everyone at these events was comfortable and having fun. Professionally and personally, the best interests of those around him continued to top his priority list. Other accomplishments of McMarlin include serving as Director of Government and Public Affairs for one the nation\u2019s largest college financial entities, and serving as a member of the Executive Committee of the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s National Advisory Council. McMarlin held a degree in Journalism with a focus on Advertising and Television Production from The Ohio State University. For his work he appeared on the covers of Time Magazine, New York Times Magazine, and has been featured in New York Magazine, The Washington Post, The New York Times and quoted in various other national media. McMarlin was even featured in Breitbart News. And in true McMarlin style he was somehow able to incorporate the McRib sandwich into a serious political discussion about Donald Trump. What a guy. Now he is forever etched in the hearts of those who loved him. In 2015, a friend of mine was having major medical problems. She was depressed. Enter Doug McMarlin. He helped to brighten her spirits by sending her a book signed by one of her favorite authors. All I had to do was ask Doug to send it to her. He took care of the rest. That\u2019s the kind of guy he was. A good guy\u2019s good guy if you will. Doug McMarlin was an accomplished man. He worked for State Senators and former Ohio Governor George Voinovich\u2019s administration. He was a personal aide to former Ohio Republican Party Chairman Bob Bennett. He then skyrocketed on to the national scene. But for all his accomplishments and all his victories, McMarlin will live on in those he knew because he was a caring, good man. When Tim Russert died in 2008, I remember the outpouring of emotion from so many people. People from all walks of life and all political persuasions mourned the loss of the journalist. Before his death, I knew Russert was popular, but never did I realize the magnitude of the respect and love people had for him until he was gone. Doug McMarlin\u2019s passing has been very similar. The level of which he is missed and really revered by people is truly amazing. A beautiful response toward a man who led a beautiful life. The world of politics lost a giant in 2016. His friends and family lost so much more. The engaging, funny, gregarious Doug McMarlin will live on however through all of those he impacted. That list is long and glorious.",

      "content": " Jay Roach\u00a0will direct the project while\u00a0Gary Goetzman is also signed on to\u00a0executive produce. The Trump miniseries will be based on the third installment of political commentary duo Mark Halperin and John Heilemann\u2019s\u00a0book\u00a0Game Change. Roach, Hanks, and\u00a0Goetzman all collaborated with Halperin and Heilemann\u00a0on\u00a0the 2012 HBO film\u00a0Game Change,\u00a0which chronicled the\u00a02008 presidential campaign of Senator John McCain and former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin. The 2012 installment of Game Change\u00a0was described by Breitbart News as a \u201cheinous piece of propaganda,\u201d an \u201cin-kind contribution to Barack Obama,\u201d and an overall hackneyed political hit-job on Governor Palin. Halperin and Heilemann\u2019s 2010 bestseller\u00a0Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime\u00a0was over 400 pages long. But, as Breitbart reported, the HBO film focused primarily on Palin and largely ignored President Obama. Of course the 2012 installment of\u00a0Game Change,\u00a0which starred\u00a0Ed Harris, Julianne Moore, Woody Harrelson, and\u00a0Sarah Paulson,\u00a0was a runaway award-winning success. It snagged three Golden Globes and five Primetime Emmy Awards, among others. \u201cWe are thrilled to continue our relationship with Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, whose work on their best-selling book\u00a0Game Change\u00a0set the bar for political reporting and storytelling inside a presidential campaign,\u201d HBO Films president Len Amato said in a statement. \u201cReuniting\u00a0Game Change\u00a0director and executive producer Jay Roach and Playtone producers Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman with Mark and John for a project based on their upcoming book promises to vividly capture the most unique and impactful event in modern American politics.\u201d No writer has been attached yet for the Trump miniseries.

      "subtitle": "Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican\u00a0vice presidential nominee and the first major GOP figure to endorse President Donald Trump, is calling out House Speaker Paul Ryan for what she says is \u201cRINO-Care.\u201d",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " Ryan introduced what he calls the \u201cAmerican Health Care Act,\u201d a bill that does not repeal Obamacare but only amends it. For the last several days, senior Republicans ranging from members of the House Freedom Caucus to other House Republicans to Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and more have raised serious concerns with the bill. Some call it Obamacare 2.0, others call it Obamacare Lite or Ryan-care, and now Palin\u2014in her first interview on the topic, coming on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend\u2014calls it \u201cRINO-Care.\u201d \u201cI do want to speak about this, but I am tempted to say not another word from our fearless leaders about this new form of Obamacare that I\u2019m going to call RINO-care\u2014not another word from them until we are definitively told that there is no provision whatsoever allowing Congress to exempt itself whatsoever with this law,\u201d Palin said. \u201cAs with anything else mandated by Congress, every single dotted I and crossed T better apply to them, too, and not just the people who they are lording this thing over because remember this is government-controlled health care, the system that requires enrollment in an unaffordable, unsustainable, unwanted, unconstitutional continuation of government-run medicine, and even in this new quasi-reformed proposal, there is still an aspect of socialism. That\u2019s the whole premise here.\u201d Palin expressed serious concern with the fact that Ryan\u2019s healthcare bill does not eliminate Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate. It just shifts the mandate\u2014which requires all Americans to purchase a health insurance plan even if they do not want one. Under Obamacare, those who do not comply, pay a tax to the federal government. Under Ryan\u2019s plan, those who not comply, pay a fee to the insurance companies. \u201cThis 30 percent additional fee will be collected by some in the private sector, which will mean politicians are allowed again to pick the winners and losers, and it makes you wonder who\u2019s lobbying hardest for aspects of this new bill because obviously there are special interests involved. Otherwise, certain private sector segments of our economy wouldn\u2019t be rewarded as they will be with this fee, instead of going to the IRS going to private companies,\u201d Palin said. \u201cIt would be really helpful if every single one of these politicians would do like the NASCAR drivers do\u2014and it\u2019s been said before\u2014but let them wear their sponsors plastered all over their three-piece suits when they show up so we know what side they\u2019re on and who they\u2019re actually doing their bidding for.\u201d At this time, House GOP leadership officials are refusing to answer which lobbyists specifically were involved in writing the bill and which lobbyists wrote which parts of the legislation. Palin told Breitbart News that it\u2019s a \u201cgreat question\u201d for leadership officials that they should answer because the public deserves to know. \u201cThat\u2019s a great question. That\u2019s a great question,\u201d Palin said when informed of the fact that House GOP leaders have refused to answer which lobbyists were involved in writing the legislation. \u201cThe people want to know with this RINO-Care, we know that it helps Big pharma and big lobbyists who need big government to stay in business. We want to and have the right to know who\u2019s actually putting pen to paper and writing this because we know the politicians don\u2019t write the laws.\u201d Palin also praised Cotton and Paul and Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), among others, who are standing up and pushing back on this rush from leadership on this bill. She says that they are \u201cright\u201d in pushing to make sure the process is not rushed in the way that Ryan has been rushing it through the House so far. In fact, this past week, the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees stayed in session all night to ram the bill down to the next stages, rather than taking input from the American people and slowly deliberating the process of healthcare reform. \u201cCotton is right. Dr. Rand Paul is right. Dave Brat is right. Some of these public servants are right in saying, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right this time\u2019 because, remember, the rush job under Obamacare gave us what we\u2019re having to deal with today, which is the devastating system that is again lorded over us,\u201d Palin said. \u201cThey passed it with their rushed-through process of theirs. It\u2019s very important that the people are allowed to see what\u2019s in the bill before its first draft so we know what their thinking is, so we know what the difference is between Obamacare and RINO-Care.\u201d \u201cBut we can\u2019t lose sight of the entire premise between the whole pro-Obamacare and the pro-RINO-care arguments,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s so wrong because it\u2019s still so unconstitutional. It\u2019s still taxation without representation. It still picks winners and losers because some corporations get to opt out of the requirements that hit everyone else. It still infringes on states\u2019 rights, and it still weaponizes the IRS against Americans who just simply seek freedom and choices and sensibility in their families\u2019 health care. The IRS will be taxing aspects of this without representation because we have no choice. We\u2019re shackled to politicians\u2019 whims and special interests\u2019 bullying interests, which does violate the Constitution, and it actually allows government to have a lien on our health.\u201d \u201cPeople need to know it\u2019s the foundation, it\u2019s the premise,\u201d Palin said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we\u2019re still even giving an inch on aspects of socialized medicine via this new RINO-care proposal. Is that okay with conservatives, with Republicans in office? They say they want the patient first. They say they want freedom. They say they want a free market to drive the insurance system that we have in America. But no, government is still in control. Government actually has a lien on our health because they lord over us penalties if we want to opt out of a big government mandate.\u201d When asked what she would say to Ryan if he were on Breitbart News Saturday with her this weekend\u2014Ryan has refused to come on the program to discuss these matters and will not answer Breitbart News\u2019s questions about the\u00a0bill \u2014Palin said she has lots for Ryan to explain here. But she also noted that Republicans party-wide agree that Obamacare is awful and needs to be repealed. \u201cThere is much that we agree on,\u201d Palin said. \u201cThank the Lord, we all agree that Obamacare is devastating one-sixth of our economy. That\u2019s what health care encompasses. Once the government took it over\u2014it obviously is unaffordable, unsustainable and unwanted. So, from the get-go, thank the Lord we all have that in common, and we want to do away with Obamacare. I would ask Paul Ryan\u2019s forgiveness if I come across sounding like I\u2019m just whining and complaining about a problem without proposing a solution. Like Teddy Roosevelt said, that is the definition of whining. So I want to propose solutions, and I want Paul Ryan to listen to the people who are suggesting that, okay, if government is going to be this involved in our healthcare system and choices, then allow the states to take this over. Get it out of big government\u2019s hands. The most responsive level of government is that which is closest to the people. If you\u2019re not going to allow individuals to have the freedoms and the autonomy and the choices provided in their health care, at least let it be a states\u2019 rights issue. So that\u2019s one.\u201d \u201cAnd then let\u2019s talk about the tort reform that I still don\u2019t see in the new proposal,\u201d Palin continued. \u201cI\u2019d like Paul Ryan to address that more clearly. I\u2019d like him to really talk about how he proposes to tackle the waste and the fraud in the healthcare system. I\u2019d really like him to talk about the interstate commerce allowance now because we know that that has caused a lack of competition, and I really want him to address just that good old American freedom of choice. How can he convince the American people that this isn\u2019t just still big government in bed with big pharma and big Wall Street and sticking it to the people with all its globaloney that was part of Obamacare. How is this RINO-care any different?\u201d Palin concluded the interview by noting that she has the utmost confidence that President Trump will move to scrap Ryan\u2019s bill and fix this whole process before this gets out of hand. \u201cHe will step in and fix it,\u201d Palin said. \u201cI have great faith that President Trump is one who will fulfill campaign promises. He already has a track record of doing so well in these first months, I\u2019m just really proud to have been part of the constituency that wanted him in there and worked hard to get him in there. So, yeah, I\u2019m sure that President Trump is going to do the right thing and listen to all sides, of course, but understand, especially, that as a businessman, he\u2019s going to understand whether this makes sense in his vision of how to grow businesses and how to get government off our back and back on our side. How will we create a smaller, smarter government with a proposal like this that basically allows for the continuation of a growth of government? That\u2019s what any aspect of Obamacare or RINO-care does. So asking President Trump specifically about how running a business, not a Wall Street business, but mom-and-pop main street business, how does RINO-care help their business get to grow and drive and survive in this economy?\u201d LISTEN TO FORMER ALASKA GOV.

Colin Kaepernick Just Pulled ANOTHER Political Stunt.\u201d Along with its knock against Kaepernick, the article written by website contributor Mary Kate Knorr noted that Donald Trump did not defund the Meals On Wheels program, gossip site TMZ reported. The player, who spent the past NFL season protesting against the country by refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem, recently declared himself a free agent but has thus far been unable to find a new team to continue his pro football career. The Palin article specifically cited the player\u2019s protests. \u201cHis last stunt cost him the respect of most NFL officials, as teams across the country have chosen not to offer Kaepernick a contract following his kneeling-during-the-National-Anthem stunt last year,\u201d the piece insisted. Kaepernick did make his donation after liberals and the media began claiming that President Trump\u2019s budget plan defunded the charitable program that feeds tens of thousands of needy Americans. But, despite the media\u2019s claims that Trump was taking money away from the program, a closer examination of the president\u2019s budget revealed he wasn\u2019t actually proposing any cuts to the program at all. Ultimately, after TMZ highlighted the Palin article, for an unexplained reason the piece was pulled down from the former governor\u2019s website.

It will be a week from Saturday. What do you think? What kind of grade would you give him? PALIN: I\u2019m obviously extremely thankful that he has been elected because, you know, so many of us in America knew that the status quo had to go. And we could not afford another term of Obama via Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidency if she were to be elected. So very thankful Trump was elected. Thankful that he understands that Americans expect America to be great and to be strong in order for the world to be more peaceful and more safe, more secure. So very thankful Trump is fulfilling a lot of the promises that he made to lead, not from behind but to have America lead from up front, letting the rest of the world know that, you know, we expect peace in this world. We don\u2019t want to have to intervene in other nations. We don\u2019t want to have to intervene and try this regime change throughout other lands, and we can get to that as long as America is safe and secure and is a leader on the globe, and that to me is Trump\u2019s mission, which I appreciate. TAPPER: But they have called for regime change in Syria. PALIN: Well, I think what the objective is though is to not have to intervene and tell any other country who should rule and how they should live and whether they should have a democracy ruling the people or not. And we\u2019re able to, like I say, get there by leading as an example, having our own ports swept, if you will, in America before we\u2019re over there telling other countries they better sweep their porch. We have to get it together here in America, be safe, be secure, be sovereign and solvent so we can be that shining light, an example for other countries. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

      "content": " Nugent \u2014 a vocal supporter of then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 visited the White House Thursday with fellow musician Kid Rock and former Alaska governor Sarah Palin. The 68-year-old \u201cStranglehold\u201d singer posed for a picture with Trump in the Oval Office and gifted him a red-white-and-blue autographed guitar. But a photo of the meeting posted to Twitter Thursday apparently caught the eye of Crosby, Still, Nash and Young co-founder David Crosby, who called Nugent and Trump a \u201cpair of \u201ca**holes\u201d in a message on his Twitter account.   Nugent responded in an interview Thursday with 77WABC, calling Crosby a \u201clost soul\u201d and a \u201cdoper.\u201d \u201cDavid Crosby, he\u2019s kind of a lost soul, and he\u2019s done so much substance abuse throughout his life that his logic meter is gone,\u201d Nugent said in an interview with the outlet\u2019s Rita Cosby. \u201cHis reasoning and his depth of understanding is pretty much gone, so it doesn\u2019t surprise me, I feel quite sad for the guy.\u201d \u201cIf you smoke enough dope, you just become overwhelmed with hate and ignorance,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Crosby \u2014 a fierce critic of Trump \u2014 fired back at Nugent in another message on his Twitter account Friday. \u201cNugent is a brainless twit\u2026 I can out think him without even trying hard,\u201d he wrote.  Nugent and Crosby hold drastically different opinions of the president; the former hit the trail for Trump during the campaign, often playing guitar and singing before rallies, while the latter blasted Trump as \u201cwithout question the worst president we have ever had\u201d in an interview with the San Luis Obispo Tribune this month. \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot and a child and an asshole, and he\u2019s brought a crew of rapists in with him to screw the economy every way they could and try to get more money for themselves,\u201d Crosby told the paper. In a separate interview with Variety this month, Crosby\u2019s former CSNY bandmate Graham Nash suggested the\u00a0iconic rock group could put aside their well-publicized differences and reunite to better the country during Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cHere\u2019s how I feel about it: I believe that the issues that are keeping us apart pale in comparison to the good that we can do if we get out there and start talking about what\u2019s happening,\u201d Nash told the outlet.\u00a0 \u201cSo I\u2019d be totally up for it even though I\u2019m not talking to David and neither is Neil.

      "author": "John Hayward",
      "content": " \u201cI\u2019m extremely pleased, of course, that our new president is in there building the team that he believes he needs in order to fulfill promises to the American electorate, to make America great again, and I\u2019m very, very happy that he\u2019s there,\u201d said Palin. LISTEN:  She said she found the idea of giving a simplistic letter grade to the Trump administration annoying, preferring to say President Trump is doing \u201cvery well.\u201d \u201cRemember, those of you who maybe still aren\u2019t aboard the Trump Train but know that the Trump movement had to be ushered in, in order to get rid of the status quo that was harming America, keep doing your ABCs and remember what that was: it was Anybody but Clinton,\u201d she said. \u201cSo stick with your little alphabet analogy there. Those who are asking for a grade of this administration, just keep remembering it could have been Clinton.\u201d Palin applauded Marlow\u2019s point that arguing over\u00a0the fine points of Trump\u2019s policy, and even dealing with some disappointments, should be vastly preferable for conservatives over fighting for their political lives \u2013 and even basic constitutional freedoms, like free speech \u2013 under a Clinton presidency. She suggested imagining what sort of Supreme Court justice would currently be taking the late Antonin Scalia\u2019s place under President Hillary Clinton. Marlow noted that Palin has been \u201cquite critical in recent days\u201d of President Trump\u2019s pick for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. \u201cShe said, \u2018Common Core now doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 or something, and you went buck wild on her,\u201d Marlow recalled. \u201cI sure did!\u201d Palin cheerfully agreed. \u201cShe said that, in fact, Common Core hasn\u2019t really existed for the past couple of years. I would ask, do these politicians, do these elitist bureaucrats, do they even send their children or grandchildren, are they in public schools? When our kids and our grandkids come home and we sit down with them each night, still to this day, and we work with them on their homework, the Common Core curriculum is alive and not well in the classroom.\u201d \u201cIf the leader now of the education sector of our country would deny that Common Core is in existence, she needs to try to tell that to our really, really great public school teachers, who still have to explain and kind of apologize to the public school parents \u2013 I\u2019m one of them \u2013 as to why the curriculum is as confusing and burdensome and less freeing for our teachers, who know what our students need best, as do the parents. Good schoolteachers still have to explain to us that under Common Core, these requirements are quite burdensome and nonsensical,\u201d she said. She accused DeVos of being \u201creally out of touch\u201d for denying all of this was happening. Palin followed up with some of the highlights of Trump\u2019s first hundred days, beginning with the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. \u201cI\u2019m extremely thankful \u2013 we all should be \u2013 that he\u2019s in there now,\u201d she said. She also praised Trump\u2019s commitment to change President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201clead from behind\u201d foreign policy, \u201cwhich made the world a less safe place to be.\u201d \u201cTrump quashed that. He said no more leading from behind. America is that \u2018beacon of hope.\u2019 We are a country\u00a0\u2026 of just this perfect storm, if you will, with the natural resources to be developed, with the manpower, and with the intellect, and with the patriotism, the unity that a country needs in order to be so successful, to be great and to be a leader that other countries would wish to emulate. America has all that, and we can put it into play for the greater good of the world by leading, and not leading from behind, which is kind of Orwellian-speak,\u201d said Palin. \u201cLeading again on the global stage and the Supreme Court pick, those are two specifics \u2013 but Alex, we need to make sure to remind our friends, our supporters, people who are really tuned in to what\u2019s going on today and get frustrated under any administration. Maybe they\u2019re frustrated with what Trump does, some of the wrinkles that are certainly part of the agenda that we\u2019ve witnessed,\u201d she suggested. \u201cWe can never put our faith and our hope in man, in any one man, certainly not a politician,\u201d Palin counseled. \u201cMan is fallible. We\u2019re going to be disappointed if we put all of our hope and faith in one man \u2013 a politician, a government that cannot make us happy, healthy, wealthy, and wise. We need to look at the bigger picture here, as you suggested in your opening.\u201d Another highlight of the first hundred days for Palin was the \u201cquote-unquote massive tax cut proposals that will come from the White House.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy about that. That\u2019s another promise fulfilled,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that to allow us to be solvent and sovereign, we need to see jobs created. The way that jobs are going to be created and people will be productive again in this country is for tax cuts that will really benefit the middle class, especially the working class. More jobs will be created with tax cuts, so I\u2019m excited about that coming down the pike.\u201d \u201cWe have to cut taxes,\u201d she stressed. \u201cLook at that corporate tax rate we have that is, what, second highest in the developed world? Our corporate tax rate certainly is one of the job creation prohibiters that we\u2019re suffering under. So that has to be done, and certainly people with our income taxes, we realize it\u2019s taxation without representation. The government is taking from us the fruits of our labor, and we\u2019re not receiving the services in return that are on par with the amount that they\u2019re taking from us. It\u2019s a given: taxes must be cut in this country, and I would think that everybody knows that.\u201d \u201cBut as for it then contributing to an accumulation of debt \u2013 you\u2019re right: it\u2019s semantics, and it\u2019s bogus,\u201d Palin said to Marlow\u2019s point that the left controls the language of tax reform and treats tax cuts as an expensive indulgence that must be \u201cpaid for\u201d somehow. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to result in accumulation of debt,\u201d she argued. \u201cWe can\u2019t just hand that over to those in government who hold the purse strings and keep spending more and more money that we do not have. We need to ratchet down the size of government. This government overreach in every area of our life that\u2019s getting more and more expensive, we can\u2019t just swallow that and say, \u2018Oh, well, that\u2019s just the way it is, and wow, we\u2019re going to have to take more money from the people in order to pay for growing government.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt always killed me when I was a city council member, I was a mayor, I was a city manager, I was a governor, and I would watch every 12 months when the government\u2019s budget was due. I\u2019d either help craft it, or it would come across my desk. I would always ask the bureaucrats and the politicians creating these budgets, \u2018What\u2019s going on here? Just because 365 days have passed, you just automatically inherently believe that the budget amount has to increase? Why? Are people getting more for the money that you\u2019re taking from them? Has the population grown that much?\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cIn each level of government, it\u2019s just so inherent that oh, you know, government grows; that\u2019s just the way it is. It doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d Palin contended. Marlow asked Palin about the \u201cwar on free speech\u201d conducted by masked thugs at universities, prominently including Berkeley, where he was once a student. \u201cWell, first, it blows me away that you\u2019re from Berkeley. Talk about not drinking the Kool-Aid!\u201d Palin said with a laugh. \u201cThese Berkeley students, bless their hearts, they\u2019re hypocrites on steroids,\u201d she said on a more serious note. \u201cIt is amazing to me and anybody else with just an ounce of common sense in their veins to ever be able to believe that those who preach tolerance and diversity, and we\u2019re gonna embrace diversity \u2013 but Heaven forbid you say something that might hurt our little snowflakey feelings. You know, we\u2019ll melt there down in Berkeley if you say something that we can\u2019t agree with!\u201d \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re the most intolerant people if they are going to protest someone who is a bastion of free speech. Ann Coulter is on their side! When they are spewing the free speech rhetoric, she\u2019s saying, \u2018Exactly! And here, let\u2019s exercise it! Let me prove to you, you guys prove with me, that we\u2019re all for free speech!\u2019 And yet, they\u2019re so blinded by their hatred for anybody who does not agree just down the line with them on everything that they will not tolerate Ann Coulter speaking her mind,\u201d said Palin. Marlow advised President Trump to resist advice about \u201cmoderating\u201d his positions to secure the approval of left-wingers who will never stop hating him \u2013 something Palin is well positioned to understand, as the target of an unprecedented campaign of left-wing vilification in 2008. \u201cAmen. Preach it, brother,\u201d Palin agreed. \u201cPresident Trump needs to realize he can\u2019t win them over. You cannot. He can learn from our mistakes, those of us who have been in that position on a much smaller scale. We have tried to win them over, and it doesn\u2019t work. It bites you in the butt, and it harms those who you have promised to serve.\u201d \u201cRight on, too, in talking about the big tent,\u201d she said to Marlow\u2019s defense of an ideologically diverse Republican Party. \u201cYou know, most of us, we come from big-tent families. Our social circles even, and our communities, they\u2019re big tents, and really, we\u2019re better off for it. Talk about diversity and learning from other people\u2019s perspectives that are shared and all that \u2013 that\u2019s all great.\u201d \u201cBut no, when you are leading an agenda that people have put blood, sweat, and tears forth, to make sure that agenda finally is given an opportunity to be made manifest so that our lives can be made better, you have to surround yourself with people who are obviously going to help the cause and not hurt the cause,\u201d she added. \u201cYou cannot surround yourself, one, with a bunch of yes-men. That certainly harms the cause. You will never grow as a leader. You have to be growing as a leader as your constituents will be growing along with you. So you can\u2019t have a bunch of yes-men. Those of us who have been in business and been in politics certainly recognize that,\u201d said Palin. \u201cBut also, you have to have those who at least will share your vision. Maybe some of the idiosyncrasies, maybe some of the details in how you\u2019re going to get there, you can argue some of the ways to do that, but the vision has got to be the same,\u201d she emphasized. \u201cNow, do globalists, do big government professional politicians who are in it for a season, not a reason \u2013 they\u2019re in politics for a job, for a career, for the money, for the power \u2013 do they share the vision of average, hard-working, patriotic Americans who want government out of our lives so that we can be trusted as individuals to run our businesses the way that we know best and to raise our families the way that is best for our families?\u201d Palin asked. \u201cGovernment, faceless bureaucrats, they don\u2019t know how to do that. They keep screwing it up. Well, globalists and big government people, some in office today under Trump, they believe in that garbage of big government knowing best. That is the antithesis of the vision that those on the Trump Train have, and that Trump Train roared through this country so powerfully, so loudly and adamantly, that there was no stopping it. That\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t surprised when Trump won,\u201d she contended. \u201cSo those who don\u2019t share that vision, who are there, quote-unquote, serving our president and the vision, the mission that he is on, that is shared by the majority of the voters \u2013 it\u2019s frustrating to us because we do want to sound that warning bell that you can\u2019t win them over. They\u2019re certainly stuck in their ways, and if they give you lip service that they\u2019re there with you \u2013 those are the yes-men that we don\u2019t need around our president,\u201d Palin advised. In parting, Palin suggested a mission for Marlow: \u201cI wish you would take the opportunity to get down to Berkeley and speak with your alumni. Go down there and talk to the folks down there about what tolerance really is and how healthy diverse opinions really can be. Talk about the Second Amendment. You would be one, Alex \u2013 well, they\u2019d probably get really wee-weed up about it \u2013 but you could be a great spokesperson for the cause.\u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.

      "content": " Governor Palin said, \u201cQuashing Obama\u2019s anti-American energy plan makes America great again.

President Obama\u00a0enacted it last December under using the\u00a01953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which gives the president the authority\u00a0to designate certain offshore areas unavailable for\u00a0commercial use. Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Bill Clinton also invoked the legislation. President Trump said that the offshore drilling ban harms the economy. He explained, \u201cOur country\u2019s blessed with incredible natural resources, including abundant offshore oil and natural gas reserves, but the federal government has kept 94 percent of these offshore areas closed for exploration and production.\u201d Trump added, \u201cThis deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth.\u201d",

She said she\u2019d like to do something political, that she\u2019d love to do something that makes a statement.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s always a collaboration.

She\u2019s the only person I can ever see doing this \u2026 Not a lot of people are fearless enough to do something like this.\u201d This is ironic when one considers January 8, 2011 \u2014\u00a0the date on which Representative Gabby Giffords (D-AZ) was shot by the mentally ill Jared Loughner. That shooting occurred after former Alaska Gov.\u00a0Sarah Palin had asked conservative voters to target certain Congressional districts in the 2010 midterm elections, so as to vote representatives who voted for Obamacare out of office. Palin\u2019s political action committee, SarahPAC, had released a graphic showing\u00a0crosshairs on 20 swing districts then held by Democrats in Congress that could flip to Republicans. Due to Palin\u2019s successful endorsements of candidates in those swing districts, 19 of those\u00a020 targeted races were won by Republicans in the 2010 midterms. The one district that stayed Democratic was Giffords\u2019.

      "content": " Palin, in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News, called for the media industry to be more careful than they were back when Giffords was shot\u2014specifically asking for \u201cmedia integrity\u201d when it comes to learning the motives of the shooter of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise at the GOP congressional baseball practice on Wednesday morning. \u201cPrayers for healing are raised for all victims of today\u2019s horrific violence, while we with lift up thankfulness that lives were not lost,\u201d Palin told Breitbart News. \u201cWhile justice is now sought upon the capture of the deranged attacker, an additional prayer must be for no acceptance of a rush to destroy anyone else in this horrible incident. Those seeking political advantage reacted so recklessly and irresponsibly the last time a member of Congress was brutally attacked, as media inexplicably played a knee-jerk blame game assuming that attacker\u2019s motives. Today\u2019s shooter appears to be a Bernie Sanders supporter and campaign volunteer. But Bernie Sanders is not to blame. Maybe the media have matured enough to allow coverage of this most recent violence to focus on facts, because media integrity will be crucial as America witnesses today\u2019s events unfolding and, on behalf of our Congressional Representatives, we all seek justice.\u201d Palin\u2019s call for unity, and media responsibility\u2014and her statement standing up for Sanders despite the shooter being a Sanders supporter\u2014comes after she has been the target of vitriolic media rhetoric for years. Perhaps the worst example of the media targeting Palin was in the wake of the shooting of Giffords, where Palin was blamed inaccurately. Republicans and Democrats in Washington are calling for unity in the wake of this latest shooting, and for an end to the leftist and media driven vitriol in the national debate. While there are some initial signs of unity\u2014from President Donald Trump\u2019s reaction to House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s to even Sanders\u2019 statement and now this statement from Palin\u2014it remains to be seen how long this will last.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " The\u00a0Times\u2018 editorial, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Lethal Politics,\u201d\u00a0will appear in the print edition of Thursday\u2019s newspaper. It argues that political violence will continue unless President Donald Trump and the Republicans stop opposing gun control. Along the way, the\u00a0Times claims [original link]: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee circulated\u00a0a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. However, there was no evidence of\u00a0political \u201cincitement.\u201d First of all, the Tucson killer, Jared Loughner, was mentally disturbed and had no political motivations. As even the left-wing HuffPost reiterated\u00a0Wednesday: \u201cPeople said Jared Lee Loughner was motivated by politics. Reporting proved them wrong.\u201d Second, Sarah Palin\u2019s map was virtually identical to those used by Democrats for years, depicting targets atop contested congressional districts. At the time, Palin called the false accusations against her a \u201cblood libel,\u201d and for good reason: it was a slander imputing responsibility to her for the deaths of innocents, with the sole purpose of punishing her for her beliefs. The\u00a0Times goes on to argue that \u201cthere\u2019s no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack\u201d in Wednesday\u2019s shooting. That statement is so completely false that it calls to mind George Orwell\u2019s\u00a0observation about journalism during the Spanish Civil War: \u201cI saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts, not even the relationship which is implied in an ordinary lie.\u201d There is no evidence whatsoever\u00a0of political incitement in the Giffords case, while there is overwhelming evidence that James T. Hodgkinson, the now-deceased attacker\u00a0at the baseball diamond, nurtured a vicious hatred of Trump and Republicans\u00a0and was a fan of left-wing media. And according to eyewitnesses, he asked whether the players were Republicans or Democrats before attacking. That is not conclusive evidence of incitement \u2014 at least, not yet \u2014 but it is more persuasive than in any other recent case. The\u00a0Times\u2018 false equivalence between the\u00a0two shootings provides a sick excuse\u00a0for what Hodgkinson did by\u00a0making it appear to be partially Republicans\u2019 fault. That is worse than \u201cfake news.\u201d It is an effort to exploit a horrific act of violence for\u00a0the purpose of stoking political divisions, reinforcing the hysteria in which Hodgkinson\u00a0was steeped.

Hodgkinson targeted Republican members of Congress at\u00a0a baseball practice. Four players were wounded, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), who remains in the hospital in critical condition. Originally, the\u00a0Times article, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Lethal Politics,\u201d had stated: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably.

Before the shooting, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. But in that case no connection to the shooting was ever established. A correction now appears at the bottom of the article: Correction: June 15, 2017 \n\nAn earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords.

      "content": " Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is considering suing the New York Times for libel after the Times published a Wednesday editorial falsely accusing her of inciting Jared Lee Loughner to shoot Rep. Gabby Giffords in 2011 even though it has long been established that there has never been any evidence whatsoever linking Palin to the attempted assassination. Palin tweeted that a journalist suggested to her on Thursday that the Times \u201chas fulfilled the two criteria for libeling a public figure\u201d\u2014a reckless disregard for the truth and malice. She said she is \u201ctalking to attorneys this AM and exploring options.\u201d   After\u00a0James T. Hodgkinson, who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and hated President Donald Trump and Republicans, shot House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) and targeted other Republicans as they were practicing for their Congressional baseball game, the Times decided to publish an editorial\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0in which it falsely blamed Palin for the assassination attempt on Giffords: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. In addition, despite plenty of evidence to the contrary (Hodgkinson asked at least two Representatives whether the players on the baseball diamond were Republicans or Democrats before he started shooting), the Times added that \u201cthere\u2019s no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack\u201d As Breitbart Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak pointed out, \u201cthe Times\u2018 false equivalence between the two shootings provides a sick excuse for what Hodgkinson did by making it appear to be partially Republicans\u2019 fault. That is worse than \u2018fake news.\u2019 It is an effort to exploit a horrific act of violence for the purpose of stoking political divisions, reinforcing the hysteria in which Hodgkinson was steeped.\u201d Palin linked to Pollak\u2019s article in a Facebook post\u00a0and slammed the Times\u2018 \u201csickening editorial\u201d that attempted to \u201cdestroy innocent people with more lies and more fake news\u201d to advance the Times\u2018 preferred narrative at all costs, facts be damned: With this sickening NYT\u2019s editorial, the media is doing exactly what I said yesterday should not be done. Despite commenting as graciously as I could on media coverage of yesterday\u2019s shooting, alas, today a perversely biased media\u2019s knee-jerk blame game is attempting to destroy innocent people with lies and more fake news. As I said yesterday, I\u2019d hoped the media had collectively matured since the last attack on a Representative when media coverage spewed blatant lies about who was to blame. There\u2019s been no improvement. The NYT has gotten worse. \u2013 SP As Breitbart News has extensively reported, hours after Giffords was shot on January 8, 2011, outlets like CNN immediately tried to implicate Palin. It turned out that Loughner, the murderer who killed six people and shot 18, did not have any political leanings whatsoever. He actually spoke to Giffords at a town hall event years before and may have been upset that Giffords brushed off his question with a non-answer. In any event, authorities definitively concluded that Loughner was \u201cin no way influenced by Tea Partiers, conservative media, or Palin.\u201d After\u00a0the Giffords shooting, Zach Osler, Loughner\u2019s friend, told ABC that Loughner was apolitical and did not even watch television. \u201cHe disliked the news. He didn\u2019t listen to political radio. He didn\u2019t take sides. He wasn\u2019t on the left. He wasn\u2019t on the right,\u201d Osler added. Another friend, Bryce Tierney, told left-wing Mother Jones that Loughner was not political. As the left-wing outlet noted: Tierney notes that Loughner did not display any specific political or ideological bent: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like he was in a certain party or went to rallies\u2026It\u2019s not like he\u2019d go on political rants. The Times\u2018 editorial was so outrageous and egregious that even mainstream media journalists, some of Palin\u2019s most vicious haters on the right, and those on the left like Chris Hayes\u00a0agreed that the Times had to issue a\u00a0correction. https://twitter.com/jonathanvswan/status/875194463773216772 On Thursday morning, the Times finally\u00a0issued a correction that read: \u201cAn earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established.\u201d ",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) tweeted on Thursday: \u201cI\u2019ve read the Republican \u2018health care\u2019 bill. This is blood money. They\u2019re paying for tax cuts with American lives.\u201d  And former presidential nominee Hillary Clinton tweeted Friday: \u201cForget death panels. If Republicans pass this bill, they\u2019re the death party.\u201d  Her 2016 rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), tweeted a similar message \u2014 then deleted it. That alarmist rhetoric is spreading throughout the party, from the top down, as if last week\u2019s shooting attack against Republicans, in which House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) was critically injured, never happened. Democrats seem not to care that telling Americans that Republicans are trying to kill them might prompt others to act violently in what they may perceive to be their own self-defense. It is not the first time Democrats have accused Republicans of wanting to kill Americans. During the debate over Obamacare in 2009-10, Democrats told the public that if Republicans succeeded in blocking the bill, they would be responsible for mass death across the country. Then-Rep. Alan Grayson stood on the floor of the House and said: \u201cIf you get sick America, the Republican health care plan is this: Die quickly.\u201d And\u00a0left-wing pundit Ezra Klein attacked Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-VT) for opposing the \u201cpublic option\u201d \u2014 i.e. government-run health care for all \u2014 by accusing him of being \u201cwilling to cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people\u201d (original link). But that rhetoric was largely confined to the political fringe. Today, the party\u2019s leaders are accusing Republicans of wanting to kill Americans. Perhaps Democrats believe that by referring to mass death, they are answering Republicans tit-for-tat, after former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin attacked Obamacare\u2019s \u201cdeath panels\u201d in 2009. But as with the effort by the so-called \u201cResistance\u201d to repeat what it thinks the Tea Party did to win in 2010, the Democrats have failed \u2014 perhaps deliberately \u2014 to understand what it is they are imitating. \u201cDeath panels\u201d referred to a real aspect of Obamacare: namely, the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which has sweeping powers to determine reimbursements under Medicare, and whose rulings could only be overruled by a two-thirds majority of Congress. There was a justified fear that health care would be rationed \u2014 i.e. withheld \u2014 from the elderly by the IPAB as a way to cut costs. (Health care is rationed under any policy, but the free market ensures it is rationed by individuals themselves.) In this case, there is no link whatsoever between the Republican bill and the potential death of patients. Democrats argue that death is relevant because the Congressional Budget Office and other analysts have\u00a0estimated that more people will go without health insurance under the Republican plan. But even uninsured people can obtain life-saving care in an emergency. If not having insurance is equivalent to death, then Obamacare \u201ckilled\u201d the millions of American whose insurance policies it canceled. It is entirely legitimate to criticize the Republican legislation for potentially increasing the number of uninsured people. But telling Americans that Republicans will allow them to die \u2014 or that they want them to die in order to give the rich more money \u2014 is a reckless and inflammatory exaggeration. The Sanders supporter\u00a0who shot Scalise and four other people was enraged, among other things, by Republicans\u2019 health care policies. Many Americans will recognize Democrats\u2019 alarmism for what it is \u2014 the same failed tactic that President Barack Obama used when he trotted out a \u201cparade of horribles\u201d to argue against the budget sequester (which he had proposed!) in 2013. Obama\u2019s scaremongering backfired, and Democrats\u2019 new accusations likely will as well. But to tell Americans, just days after a politically-motivated mass shooting, that Republicans want them dead is worse than divisive. It is dangerous. Joel B.

      "author": "Tony Lee",
      "content": " \u201cToday, Sarah Palin took a stand against The New York Times Company by filing a lawsuit which seeks to hold The Times accountable for stating that Governor Palin is part of a \u2018sickeningly familiar pattern\u2019 of politically motivated violence and that she incited the horrific 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords, a tragedy where the gunman seriously wounded numerous people and killed 6, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl,\u201d Palin\u2019s lawyers\u2014Ken Turkel, Shane Vogt, and S. Preston Ricardo\u2014said in a statement. The complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court in the Southern District of New York, states that \u201cat the time of publication, The Times knew and had published pieces acknowledging that there was no connection between Mrs. Palin and Loughner\u2019s 2011 shooting.\u201d \u201cIn doing so, The Times violated the law and its own policies,\u201d it reads. Messrs. Turkel, Vogt, and Ricardo said Palin \u201cseeks to hold The Times to its November 13, 2016, pledge [\u2018to rededicate itself to reporting facts honestly and holding power to account\u2019], and to face both journalistic and financial accountability for the false statements that it published about Mrs. Palin.\u201d As Breitbart News previously noted, Palin indicated on Twitter that she was \u201cconsidering suing the New York Times for libel\u201d the day after the Times published its editorial even though \u201cit has long been established that there has never been any evidence whatsoever linking Palin to the attempted assassination.\u201d   Here is what the Times originally wrote in its editorial: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. The Times, after much public backlash from even Palin\u2019s harshest\u00a0critics on the left and right, then issued two subsequent corrections. After adding that \u201cno connection to the shooting was ever established\u201d to its original editorial, the Times issued this correction on June 15: An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established. But the Times never corrected that it had falsely stated that Palin had put \u201cGiffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs\u201d when Palin did no such thing. Later in the day on June 15, the Times edited its editorial again to note that Palin\u2019s map \u201cshowed the targeted electoral districts of Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.\u201d It then issued its second correction: The editorial also incorrectly described a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting. It depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath stylized cross hairs. Yet, in a statement to CNN, the Times insisted that their errors did not \u201cundercut or weaken the argument of the piece.\u201d Palin\u2019s lawyers pointed out that \u201cdespite recognizing that its statements about Mrs. Palin in the June 14, 2017 column \u2018America\u2019s Lethal Politics\u2019 are not true, The Times repeatedly failed to meaningfully retract or correct its column and apologize to Mrs. Palin for publishing it. Rather, The Times issued a statement affirming that its \u2018error doesn\u2019t undercut or weaken the argument of the piece.\u2019\u201d To prove that the Times had \u201cample facts available that established that there was no connection between Mrs. Palin and Loughner\u2019s crime,\u201d the lawyers point to an article the Times published on January 15, 2011, that \u201crecognized that no direct or clear link between political rhetoric and Loughner\u2019s actions could be claimed.\u201d In addition, the lawyers point out that New York Times columnist Charles Blow once wrote that \u201cthe only problem is that there was no evidence then, and even now, that overheated rhetoric from the right had anything to do with the shooting\u201d of Giffords. The lawyers also refer to Blow\u2019s column, \u201cShe Who Must Not Be Named,\u201d\u00a0that was critical of the left\u2019s and the establishment press\u2019s continued coverage of Palin. In Blow\u2019s column, he asks, \u201cWhat purpose does it serve other than inflaming passions to drive viewership and Web clicks?\u201d The complaint points out that Blow\u2019s \u201ccolumn acknowledges that there is existing hostility held toward\u00a0Mrs. Palin, and also recognizes that her name and attacks upon her inflame passions and thereby drive viewership and Web clicks to media companies.\u201d \u201cThe Times published the Palin Article with actual knowledge that stories attacking Mrs. Palin inflame passions, which drives viewership and Web clicks,\u201d the complaint further reads. \u201cThus, The Times knowingly and voluntarily exploited and retained a benefit conferred by Mrs. Palin, in special circumstances particular to this case in which it would be inequitable for The Times to retain that benefit without paying the value thereof to Mrs. Palin.\u201d Palin\u2019s attorneys argue that the Times\u2019\u00a0\u201cconduct was committed knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly and maliciously, with the intent to harm Mrs. Palin, or in blatant disregard of the substantial likelihood of causing her harm, thereby entitling Mrs. Palin to an award of punitive damages.\u201d Two of Palin\u2019s lawyers\u2013Messrs. Turkel and Vogt\u2013successfully represented Hulk Hogan in his $140 million invasion of privacy suit against Gawker after Gawker published Hogan\u2019s sex tape. As noted on the firm\u2019s website, they \u201cconvinced a Pinellas County jury to award Terry Bollea, professionally known as Hulk Hogan, $55 million in economic damages and another $60 million in damages for emotional distress. The jury awarded an additional $25.1 million in punitive damages, making the verdict one of the largest contested verdicts in Pinellas County history.\u201d 01 \u2013 Complaint W-o Exhibits (00125593xBEB76) by Breitbart News on Scribd ",

      "subtitle": "Former Alaska governor and Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin filed a defamation lawsuit against the\u00a0New York Times on Tuesday, after it claimed in a June 14 editorial that she had incited Jared Loughner to shoot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) and kill six other people in January 2011.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " (The editorial was published online on June 14, the day several Republicans were wounded in a mass shooting, but appeared in print the following day.) It would normally be very difficult for Palin to win a defamation lawsuit simply because of a factual error. As a celebrity and a political leader, she falls under the tough standard first established by the Supreme Court (ironically) in\u00a0New York Times Company v. Sullivan (1964), which is \u201cactual malice.\u201d In this context, \u201cmalice\u201d does not refer to an emotion but to \u201creckless disregard for the truth\u201d \u2014 that is, knowing something is false but printing it anyway. In this case, the\u00a0Times is indicted by its own reporting. Just days after Loughner\u2019s shooting spree, the\u00a0Times\u00a0reported that he was mentally ill and had been focused on Giffords since 2007 \u2014 well before Palin became a national figure: What the cacophony of facts do suggest is that Mr. Loughner is struggling with a profound mental illness (most likely paranoid schizophrenia, many psychiatrists say); that his recent years have been marked by stinging rejection \u2014 from his country\u2019s military, his community college, his girlfriends and, perhaps, his father; that he, in turn, rejected American society, including its government, its currency, its language, even its math. Mr. Loughner once declared to his professor that the number 6 could be called 18. \u2026 He also may have felt rejected by the American government in general, and by Ms. Giffords in particular, with whom he had a brief \u2014 and, to him, unsatisfactory \u2014 encounter in 2007. Therefore, the\u00a0Times had reason to know that what it claimed in its editorial \u2014 that \u201cthe link to political incitement was clear\u201d \u2014 was false. It went on to explain\u00a0that Palin was responsible because her political action committee had circulated \u201ca map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.\u201d In fact \u2014 as the Times had to know, because it linked to an article by ABC News about the map \u2014\u00a0the \u201ccross hairs\u201d were above districts, not individual politicians. All of that likely amounts to actual malice under\u00a0Sullivan. The fact that the\u00a0Times\u00a0issued corrections \u2014 half-heartedly\u00a0\u2014 would not affect its liability for defamation, but might affect the damages it would face as a result. Certainly Palin can claim that she has been damaged by the editorial: as \u00a0she tweeted June 15, similar smears had significantly damaged her reputation\u00a0and perhaps her political aspirations.  Palin\u2019s complaint does not specify damages, but does ask for a jury trial, and a jury \u2014 even in New York, where the lawsuit was filed \u2014 might be very sympathetic to her claims, in an age when journalists are loathed even on the left. The Times\u2018\u00a0only possible defense would be that the editorial page is devoted to opinion, not factual reporting. The courts give more leeway to statements in opinion articles because a reasonable reader might take them with a grain of salt. Yet that would force the\u00a0Times into arguing that the facts on its editorial page \u2014 which it takes very seriously \u2014 should not be regarded as such. Essentially, the\u00a0Times would have to that claim its editorials\u00a0are \u201cfake news.\u201d On Tuesday, the\u00a0Times vowed to defend against Palin\u2019s lawsuit \u201cvigorously.\u201d That could be a very costly approach, not only in monetary terms but in terms of the\u00a0Times\u2018 reputation. It would also allow the\u00a0Times\u2018 conservative critics to shine a spotlight \u2014 for the months or years that a trial would take \u2014 on allegations that it practices \u201cfake news.\u201d Better to offer Palin an apology, a full retraction, and generous compensation. The\u00a0Times really has no defense. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News. He was named one of the \u201cmost influential\u201d people in news media in 2016.

      "subtitle": "NEW YORK CITY \u2014 Reporters and editors at the New York Times Thursday attempted to stand up to their bosses by staging an approximately 20-minute walkout/coffee break \u2014 during which they appropriated protest songs and refused to talk to Breitbart News.",
      "author": "Adam Shaw",
      "content": "  The walkout, led by the Times\u2019 union, was in protest of cuts at the paper, that include slashing their copy editor division from 100 to approximately 50 as the paper seeks to adapt itself to the ever-changing journalistic arena. The protest, staged at the Times\u2019 headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, was well-attended and featured staffers carrying signs while being led in chant as they walked around the building. \u201cThey say cutbacks, we say fight back,\u201d was one, while another promised: \u201cNo editors, no peace.\u201d  The protest was curiously low-energy, with many staffers looking nervous and apparently keen to get the short protest over with. It started late and ended within 20 minutes \u2014 about the length of a coffee break \u2014 at which point many staffers scurried through the doors. Many refused to talk to reporters, and those that would quickly shut down when a Breitbart News reporter identified himself as such. \u201cBreitbart? Oh, I can\u2019t talk to you,\u201d one staffer said. Yet an air of not only nervousness but unhappiness hung over the protest. One journalist, whom Breitbart News approached for comment, when asked about the mood in the newsroom just said, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d It is perhaps not surprising that the mood is so glum at the Gray Lady. The print-based Times has struggled to adapt to the modern world of journalism, and the cutbacks are perhaps a recognition of the new reality that old journalism faces.  Additionally, the Times was hit by a lawsuit this week from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin after the paper published an editorial falsely linking her to the 2011 Tucson shooting. The Times eventually issued a correction, but the damage was done and the lawsuit soon followed. Newsroom staff penned a colorful letter to management earlier this week expressing their grievances and painting a picture of devastating morale in the newsroom. The authors called the hope that the paper could have the same level of quality with half the number of editors \u201cdumbfoundingly unrealistic\u201d and called the uncertainty \u201ca cruelly drawn-out period in which we suspended major financial arrangements and life decisions, and carried an ever-growing kernel of fear.\u201d It goes on to describe a situation in which \u201cmorale is low throughout the newsroom, and that many of us, from editors to reporters to photo editors to support staff, are angry, embittered and scared of losing our jobs.\u201d A response from Executive Editor Dean Baquet and Managing Editor Joseph Kahn said they \u201ctake those concerns seriously\u201d and intend to \u201cmonitor this transition closely.\u201d Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.

      "subtitle": "If you were fortunate enough to be a wrestling fan in the 1980s, you saw the best of the best. The WWF was king and wrestlers like Hulk Hogan, Roddy Piper, Paul Orndorff, and Andre the Giant were as recognizable and as loved as your MLB sluggers or NFL quarterbacks.",
      "author": "Kevin Scholla",
      "content": " Even Magic and Bird had to compete with the pro grapplers. While Gretzky was surely great, Muraco was just as magnificent. Wrestling was everywhere. From kids to grandmothers, Americans tuned in to watch their favorite stars battle it out each and every week. By the mid-80s, it seemed nothing could get wilder than the WWF action. Fuji dust was flying, turnbuckles were being eaten, and coconuts were crushing craniums. The guys of the WWF were on top of the world. Then it happened. The glow from our televisions got just a little brighter when it came to our wrestling options. In 1986 the Gorgeous Ladies Of Wrestling hit the air. We would never be the same. The Gorgeous Ladies Of Wrestling\u2014GLOW\u2014was an all-women production of wrestling. Sure, the WWF has some women\u2019s matches, but after years of watching the likes of The Fabulous Moolah, fans now had the opportunity to check out a different kind of professional women\u2019s wrestlers. The GLOW girls didn\u2019t look like Moolah, who was already in her 60s, or really like anything we\u2019ve ever seen. They were wrestlers for sure, but they were true characters. Pretty girls who were funny and tough. GLOW was on to something. GLOW had an amazing following seemingly right from the start. Fans tuned in every week to see battles between good and bad and to laugh at the little skits the girls put on in between each bout. It was sports meets SNL meets Hee-Haw\u2014and it worked. The girls were feisty fighters but they also knew how to have a good time. They made jokes and acted in sketches. They even sang and rapped. Like the 1985 Chicago Bears and the 1986 New York Mets, the GLOW girls fit right in with the times. Brash, flashy, athletes complete with their own music videos. The GLOW girls were championship wrestlers and self-promoters. Just as the WWF was thriving under the leadership of Vince McMahon, GLOW carved out its own niche. The women were extremely popular. GLOW magazines, posters, and VHS tapes were the norm. GLOW was able to do it\u2019s own campy, unique, glorious thing even while the WWF was on fire. While McMahon\u2019s product had the wrestling part down, GLOW had something the WWF didn\u2019t have\u2014the gorgeous ladies. Things were good. Then after just four seasons, GLOW was gone. There are different stories as to the exact reasons for the breaking of the GLOW shtick, but financial turmoil seems to be the theme of all versions. Whatever the case, GLOW unfortunately stopped shining way too soon. Now, decades later GLOW is back\u2014at least in the headlines. A new Netflix series based on GLOW is now released. The popularity of the fictional program has led people to discover, or in some cases rediscover, the real GLOW women. The stars of GLOW are back in the spotlight and it\u2019s well deserved. In the last few weeks GLOW stars Roxy Astor, Hollywood (Jeanne Basone), and Lightning (Cheryl Rusa) all appeared on The Palin Update radio program on Mama Grizzly Radio. All three give their take on the new show and updated fans on what they\u2019re now up to. Astor is running AfterGLOW, which gives people a chance to meet the wrestlers up close and personal. A new cruise with the GLOW girls is selling out fast. Hollywood is busier than ever. The stuntwoman, actress, and model is working on a book that could be out as early as Christmastime. She is very happy that GLOW is back in the headlines. As for Lightning, she\u2019s a stuntwoman and trainer. She\u2019s also a Trump girl and a mama grizzly. Lightning spoke very candidly about her GLOW days, President Trump, and Governor Palin during her visit to The Palin Update show. If you ask Lightning, the boldness of the original GLOW made it stand out. \u201cIt was completely politically incorrect on purpose,\u201d Lightning said. \u201cThat\u2019s why everyone fell in love with it.\u201d Today\u2019s political scene is quite similar. \u201cEverybody is so busy being politically correct that when Trump popped up and was just saying out loud what everybody was thinking it just went to heart,\u201d said Lightning. The Trump supporter also has great admiration for former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. \u201cI really thought Palin got crucified in the press,\u201d she said. \u201cI love her. Strong, strong person. I love that strong woman and I totally identified with her.\u201d Sarah Palin often uses the phrase \u201cfight like a girl\u201d. Many, like Lightning who did just that for a living, can appreciate the sentiment. Savvy in politics, thanks to recognizing fake news and doing her own research, Lightning isn\u2019t afraid to take on the media. She points at the lying from the major networks as complete \u201csheeple\u201d mentality, and she encourages all Americans to take a breath and purposely go out of their way to seek out different sources. The truth can only be found by doing your homework. Lightning strikes down the dishonest press. \u201cI was bullied when I was a kid and the way they\u2019ve been leaning on him (President Trump) and his family\u2014they\u2019re the bullies,\u201d said Lightning. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for somebody who was bullied to see that. It stands out like a sore thumb to me and it just rubs me the wrong way. I don\u2019t like seeing anybody picked on, even somebody as powerful as Trump.\u201d Lightning also talks about how she became a GLOW wrestler thanks to a fight she had with her boyfriend. She recalls how the popularity of the GLOW women rose to Beatle-like levels at one point. Lightning even discusses why she feels a Hillary Clinton win last November would have set women back and she discusses what life has been like since the Netflix GLOW series started. GLOW fans will be happy to know that the overwhelming majority of these trailblazing wrestlers are very happy they were a part of the iconic show. Matilda the Hun and Mountain Fiji have had some serious health issues, but the younger GLOW vets are all seemingly in good health and in great spirits. Unlike their male wrestling counterparts who often see friend after friend meet a tragic end, the Gorgeous Ladies Of Wrestling are alive and well. The GLOW series on Netflix is fictional. While based on the original GLOW, the depiction is far from accurate. But the new show has served a greater purpose. It has brought attention to the women who made wrestling great again in the 1980s. These pioneers of the ring are still passionate about what they did all these years later. They\u2019re a proud bunch. They should be. Against all odds, they turned a shot in the dark into a white hot glow. They now have tons of new fans to share that success with.

      "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/07/07/lawyers-for-sarah-palin-and-new-york-times-appear-before-federal-judge/",
      "subtitle": "Lawyers representing former Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AK) appeared in federal court in Manhattan on Friday for an initial hearing in Palin\u2019s lawsuit against the New York Times for defamation, following the Times\u2019 editorial accusing the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee of inciting violence.",
      "author": "Ken Klukowski",
      "content": " The Times ran an editorial on June 14 of this year following the attempted assassination at a Virginia baseball field that left Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) critically injured. In that editorial, the newspaper accused Palin of inciting violence when her political action committee circulated a map with cross-hairs in various places, talking about \u201ctargeting\u201d certain Democratic races in an upcoming election. Inciting violence is a serious matter. In fact, it can be a crime under both state and federal law. State laws vary, but incitement basically consists of (1) encouraging an individual to commit a violent act, and (2) under circumstances that a reasonable person would think is likely to produce the violent act \u2014 in other words, that there is a good chance that the person receiving the encouragement will act upon it. Under federal law, again depending on the facts, inciting violence could run afoul of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 373, solicitation to commit a crime of violence, or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102, which is inciting a riot. In short, the Times accused Palin of committing a crime, one that endangers the lives and safety of innocent people. Palin was offended by the accusation and sued the New York Times for defamation, filing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. An organization (or an individual) commits defamation when (1) it publishes a statement about another person to a third person (such as a Times reader), (2) about a factual matter (not opinion), (3) that is factually false, and (4) that harms the reputation of the person being talked about. Part of defamation is the injured person must prove her injury. That is, she must present evidence as to how the false statements actually harmed her reputation in a way that cost her something. But when someone is accused of committing a crime, the law automatically presumes that such an accusation causes real harm. No proof is necessary. It is difficult for a public person like Palin to win a defamation case because the bar is set higher. A private person can recover for defamation if the speaker was merely negligent in making a false factual statement. But if the speaker is talking about a public figure, then under the Supreme Court case New York Times v. Sullivan, the plaintiff must prove that the speaker was either maliciously claiming something that the speaker knew to be false or at least made the false claim with \u201creckless disregard for the truth.\u201d The Times argued in court Friday that posting the editorial containing the accusation of incitement was an honest mistake and that, within 13 hours, the newspaper realized its error and took down the piece. Restating Palin\u2019s lawyer\u2019s argument back to him to ensure he understood the gist of it, Judge Jed Ratkoff said that Palin is arguing that \u201cthe [Times\u2019] statement was so out of whack with the facts reported \u2026 in their own news story that no one could make that kind of mistake by accident.\u201d So in this case, Palin must prove by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that the Times knew they were falsely accusing Palin of a crime or, at a minimum, were reckless in choosing those words. The New York Times will now file a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), which is dismissal when the plaintiff fails to state a claim. At that stage of litigation, a court must presume every plausible factual allegation in the lawsuit\u2019s complaint to be true, then determine whether, even under those facts, the case must be dismissed because the law would still be on the side of the defendant. Judge Ratkoff scheduled a hearing on July 31 to allow the parties to file their legal briefs on the motion to dismiss. If the judge does not dismiss the case, both sides will start the discovery process to uncover evidence about the Times\u2019 decisions in writing the editorial. At that point, the parties could move for summary judgment. The judge scheduled a December 11 trial date if there are still factual disputes unresolved after discovery that must be decided by a jury. The case is Palin v. New York Times Co., 1:17-cv-4853. Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski.",

      "subtitle": "NEW YORK CITY\u2014The New York Times claimed Friday that its\u00a0fake news smear of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, when it linked her to the 2011 Tucson shooting in a June 14 editorial, was an \u201chonest mistake\u201d\u2014as the paper defends itself from a defamation lawsuit filed by the 2008\u00a0Republican vice-presidential nominee.",
      "author": "Adam Shaw",
      "content": " The lawsuit was filed after the\u00a0Times\u2019 editorial board\u00a0accused\u00a0Palin last month of inciting violence in\u00a02010\u00a0when her PAC circulated a graphic depicting a map with crosshairs\u00a0over congressional districts then held by Democrats that the GOP hoped to\u00a0unseat in the 2010 midterm elections. One of those districts was held by Arizona Democrat Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot when a mentally ill gunman, Jared Loughner, opened fire at an Arizona gathering, wounding Giffords and killing six others. No evidence has ever been presented that shows even the slightest connection between\u00a0the map graphic Palin\u2019s PAC circulated\u00a0and the\u00a0Giffords\u00a0shooting, but it has still been trotted out as part of a blame game by left-wing groups and media outlets. Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. The Times later made two corrections, noting that \u201cso such link was established\u201d between \u201cpolitical incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords.\u201d In a second correction, the Times acknowledged that: \u201cThe editorial also incorrectly described a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting. It depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath stylized cross hairs. However, the Times insisted in a statement to CNN that their errors did not \u201cundercut or weaken the argument of the piece.\u201d On June 27, Palin filed a lawsuit claiming defamation. In their complaint, Palin\u2019s lawyers argued that \u201cdespite recognizing that its statements about Mrs. Palin in the June 14, 2017 column \u2018America\u2019s Lethal Politics\u2019 are not true, The Times repeatedly failed to meaningfully retract or correct its column and apologize to Mrs. Palin for publishing it. Rather, the Times issued a statement affirming that its \u2018error doesn\u2019t undercut or weaken the argument of the piece.\u2019\u201d The complaint then used the Times own news coverage to show that the paper knew there was no link between Giffords\u2019 mentally ill shooter and Palin\u2019s PAC graphic. In a Manhattan court, Friday, a lawyer for the Times noted the statement was corrected within 13 hours of the editorial being published. \u201cThere was an honest mistake in posting the editorial,\u201d lawyer David Schultz told federal Judge Jed Rakoff, according to the New York Post. However, Palin\u2019s lawyers claimed that they knew all along the claim was false. \u201cIt was literally acknowledged the same day in another story in their paper,\u201d said Palin lawyer Kenneth Turkel. The Times\u2019 legal team was arguing that the case should be dismissed as the statement was made in error. The law states that a public figure must prove that the speaker was either maliciously claiming something that the speaker knew to be false or at least made the false claim with \u201creckless disregard for the truth.\u201d The Times is claiming this was not the case with the June 14 editorial. A hearing is now scheduled for July 31 on whether the case should be dismissed. Two of Palin\u2019s lawyers successfully represented Hulk Hogan in his $140 million invasion of privacy suit against Gawker, after Gawker published a sex tape featuring Hogan. The firm\u2019s website notes that it is one of the biggest\u00a0contested verdicts in Pinellas County history. Adam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

      "subtitle": "Always consider the source. In this day and age of fake news, that advice rings more true than ever. Those words make a lot of sense when it comes to Tim Tebow as well. The Tebow haters are loud and plentiful. The weird, visceral hate for the man is of Palin-like proportions. Tebow\u2019s crime? Being a Christ follower, a good guy, and a heck of an athlete.",
      "author": "Kevin Scholla",
      "content": " The secular can\u2019t stand Tebow. After all, he is a devoted Christian. There is no place for God in the secular world, so to them Tebow is bad. Snarky reporters and pundits who\u2014to paraphrase Jack Buck\u2014wouldn\u2019t know a baseball if it hit them in the lip, despise Tebow. They\u2019re jealous. Liberals cringe at the thought of Tebow. The man serves God first and foremost. Not to mention he\u2019s all about work ethic and giving his all. While Bernie Bros look for handouts, Tebow keeps it high energy. To the leftists, #15 is Public Enemy #1. Tim Tebow is one of the greatest college football players of all time. While leading Florida to multiple national titles, Tebow haters hated for sure, but they couldn\u2019t criticize him for anything on the field. Tebow\u2019s Gators ran over the competition and he gave the glory to God all the way through. The haters were drowned out by the fans in the Swamp. When Tebow Time headed to Denver, the hate followed. While Broncos fans and Tebow backers cheered, the haters critiqued his mechanics and throwing style. They had something to pick on to go along with his Christianity. But, Tebow was undeterred. He kept winning, eventually leading his team to the playoffs. Tebow\u2019s Broncos knocked off the Pittsburgh Steelers in the postseason. This did not sit well with his detractors. Then the anti-Tebow types got what they hoped for\u2014a narrative against the southpaw. Sure, much of it was fabricated, but that never stops the vultures. Tebow\u2019s time with the New York Jets was more of a waste of time. Rex Ryan and company failed to utilize Tebow properly or enough. After exiting the Big Apple, Tebow\u2019s NFL future was in jeopardy. Despite having a winning record and being as good of a guy as you could ever want on and off the field, Tebow would be shut out. Tebow finally got a couple of cracks with the Patriots and Eagles but both clubs parted ways with him in the preseason. Tebow had no team, and his haters were in heaven, even if most of them don\u2019t believe in the place. After doing a bang up job as a TV analyst while helping children all across the world on a daily basis, Tebow got back into playing ball. But, this time he headed not to the gridiron but the diamond instead. Tim Tebow announced he wanted to play baseball. This infuriated the haters more than ever. How dare he try to play baseball? Remember, the petty among us do not like out of the box thinking. They are for pigeonholing. In their minds, just like women, gays and minorities can\u2019t be conservatives. Tebow can\u2019t be anything more than a failed pro quarterback and Jesus freak. To the dismay of the Never Tebow crowd, the New York Mets signed him. The haters had their talking points ready. They accused Tebow of taking the roster spot of someone more deserving. They said the Mets were doing this solely as a publicity stunt. But most of all, they did what they always did before. They rooted against the man with the same passion many of them have for Starbucks and MSNBC. After a stint in the Arizona Fall League, Columbia, South Carolina, was Tebow\u2019s first stop in the Minor Leagues. For the Mets Class A club, Tebow appeared in 63 games, batting .222 with three home runs and 23 RBIs. Along the way, Tebow filled the seats for the Fireflies and touched a community. Then, the organization promoted Tebow to the St. Lucie Mets, their Class A-Advanced team. Predictably, heads exploded. They couldn\u2019t fathom a .222 hitter getting a promotion. The Tebow haters were back. Social media lit up more than Fireflies on a summer night. The man who got completely and blatantly blackballed by the NFL was suddenly getting preferential treatment? Sounds like fake news. Even if you don\u2019t agree with the Tebow haters, .222 is .222. Tebow didn\u2019t even bat his weight with Columbia, yet he was movin\u2019 on up. Just like they did with the Jets debacle and the late cuts in New England and Philadelphia, those opposed to Tebow had something to lean on\u2014some numbers and facts to bring up instead of the usual platitudes. Then, a funny thing happened in the Minors that\u2019s causing Tebow haters some major pain. Since arriving on the scene with the St. Lucie Mets, Tebow has been red hot. He blasted a home run in his first game with his new club, a feat he also accomplished in his first game with Columbia, and he has been raking ever since. In 16 Florida State League games, Tebow is batting a robust .327 with 10 RBIs. He has hit safely in 11 consecutive contests. Then on Thursday, Tebow had his biggest pro baseball moment yet. The lefty clubbed a walk-off bomb to lead St. Lucie to a thrilling 5-4 victory over Daytona. The 2007 Heisman Trophy winner was mobbed at home plate by his teammates. None of them appeared jealous or angry. They just all looked like ball players who won a game in dramatic fashion. Tebow Time has wowed Florida once again. The haters are at a loss for words. Tebow is succeeding. The Mets may have made the right move. Still smarting from Hillary\u2019s collapse, many Tebow haters can\u2019t take this type of news. While weasely keyboard warriors, woe-is-me writers, and crying contrarians will never feel good about one of the best feel-good sports stories of our time, others are embracing Tebow. They\u2019re rooting for him and they\u2019re hoping he does well. We\u2019ve outlined who the typical Tebow haters are, but who is actually for this man? Who has the fortitude to publicly praise a Christian chasing a dream? The answer is telling. While non-athletic, socially awkward \u2018journalists\u2019 and bloggers can\u2019t comprehend Tebow the baseball player, some of today\u2019s greatest baseball players are embracing everything about him. While speaking to ESPN, many MLB All-Stars sang the praises of Tebow during the break. \u201cI\u2019m always interested to see when his name pops up,\u201d said Colorado Rockies slugger Charlie Blackmon. \u201cI think Tim Tebow\u2019s a great guy. I don\u2019t really know him, but I think it\u2019s a great story.\u201d Blackmon\u2019s teammate Nolan Arenado took it a step further. \u201cI\u2019m pulling for him, to be honest with you,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cI want him to do well; I don\u2019t want to see him fail. You\u2019re gonna fail in baseball because it\u2019s baseball, but I wanna see him do well.\u201d Tebow\u2019s ultimate baseball goal is to play for the New York Mets. The big club\u2019s lone All-Star Michael Conforto is all for that possibility. \u201cYou always hear about when he hits a home run, when he makes a big play,\u201d said Conforto. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool and inspiring, I guess, that he\u2019s been able to take this much time off and then have success in the minor leagues. I actually was down in high-A for a rehab assignment and I played with him. One thing I\u2019ll say about him is he always takes good at-bats. He\u2019s got a good eye, he doesn\u2019t chase, and I think really that\u2019s half the battle in the game of baseball as far as being a good hitter. \u201cWith how much skill it takes to play this game, for him to take that much time off [and compete in the minor leagues] is pretty impressive. \u2026 Having met him, I know he\u2019s genuine about it. He does want to play baseball. He\u2019s a great guy, and from what I know talking to players that play with him, he\u2019s a great teammate as well.\u201d Whether Tebow plays in Citi Field this season, or ever for that matter, is irrelevant\u2014a point lost on those who loathe the man. Tebow\u2019s fans root for him because of the man he is. They want him to do well. They don\u2019t root for him based on stats. Tebow goes beyond the box scores. He is beloved because of who he loves. Those on Team Tebow recognize we can use a person like him in any walk of life. His field happens to be sports. His specific sport nowadays happens to be baseball. The more a man like Tebow has a platform, the better it is for all of society. While people across the nation are donning brand new Steph Curry jerseys and Chicago Cubs hats only because they are the winning flavors of the month, the Tebow fan sees a much bigger, much more important picture. Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin gets it. \u201cOh I am so pro-Tebow, you know he is so unashamed of his savior, Jesus of Nazareth,\u201d Palin said during a Fox News interview. \u201cHe knows Jesus is going to rock your world when you give it over to him, and he\u2019s bold about it, and he knows that the son of God should be honored and praised. Tebow does that and I respect it.\u201d Years before running for president, Donald Trump took to Twitter to praise Tebow. \u201c@TimTebow has tremendous talent and a proven ability to lead. He deserves to be in the @nfl,\u201d Trump tweeted. So, while President Trump, Governor Palin, and Major League Baseball All-Stars are pro-Tebow, mealy mouthed panelists and Internet creeps are disgusted by him. Always consider the source. Tebow may continue to play well and ride that wave all the way to Queens. He may go the baseball way of Michael Jordan and only achieve a modest amount in the sport despite maximum effort. Maybe Tebow\u2019s baseball career falls somewhere in the middle of all that. Whatever happens, know this\u2014it\u2019s much more enjoyable being on the side that\u2019s rooting for Tebow to do well. He makes people smile and feel good. We will continue to enjoy that ride, as long as it lasts. It\u2019s much more fun than the approach of the miserable naysayers. The \u2018Not My President\u2019 creatures have good company in these \u2018Not My Major Leaguer\u2019 types. So, while the Tebow haters continue to hate, many of us will instead follow this good guy, pray for him, and hope for more on-field thrills. Tebow has already proven he has the off-field stuff covered. Perhaps one of the best players in all of baseball, Nolan Arenado, said it best. The Rockies third baseman hopes Tebow makes it all the way to New York and he admits he will be watching if that day comes. \u201cHeck yeah, I\u2019ll watch him,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope he goes deep four times in his first game, too.\u201d \u2014 Follow Kevin Scholla on Twitter @kevinscholla",

      "content": " This week, Bernie Quigley observed that Palin \u201cwas prelude and harbinger\u201d to Trump\u2019s arrival. He\u00a0wrote in\u00a0The Hill that he was reading William Strauss and Neil Howe\u2019s The Fourth Turning when Palin appeared on the national stage. And he said then that \u201cit was possible to see the rise of new political archetypes and forms and they are now upon us.\u201d \u201cIt was not President Donald Trump that brought the age, although he turned the key. It was Palin. And it was she who brought the reawakened spirit of Andrew Jackson, today associated with the rise of Trump,\u201d Quigley wrote. In 2010, Quigley wrote that the \u201cchange that is rising now with Palin\u201d and the Tea Party movement \u201cresembles the rise of Andrew Jackson and the free people of the western regions demanding their place and coming into the country politically.\u201d \u201cNo wonder the New York press was afraid of her then. No wonder they are still,\u201d Quigley wrote while discussing Palin\u2019s defamation lawsuit against the New York Times. While others have foolishly and inaccurately written about how New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who never appealed to conservatives, was \u201cTrump before Trump,\u201d it was actually Palin who paved Trump\u2019s road to the GOP presidential nomination and 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. As someone who has followed Palin\u2019s political career as closely as anyone, I immediately saw in Trump\u2019s campaign many similarities to Palin. They shared the same enemies who loathed them because Palin and Trump did not need political hacks in the permanent political class\u00a0to get their message to the voters. In 2016, it\u00a0was indeed quite telling that Trump made the same enemies Palin did on the right while the legacy media underestimated him like they did Palin while, at the same time, doing all they could to destroy him just like they attempted to do with the\u00a0former Alaska governor. Here are the top nine ways Palin was a\u00a0prelude to Trump: On April 29, 2009, Alaska Governor Palin joined Twitter and promptly called out a distorted story\u2014in today\u2019s parlance, a \u201cfake news\u201d story\u2014in the establishment press about her administration. The politician I dubbed \u201cThe Great CommuniTweeter\u201d\u00a0would be immediately mocked and ridiculed by the legacy\u00a0media and the political establishment for communicating with voters on Twitter and Facebook instead of on their networks and with the help of overpriced consultants. Years later, the same media figures and establishment operatives, who are always light years behind the curve and\u00a0initially mocked Palin, would be addicted to Twitter and Facebook and use those platforms on a daily basis just like Palin the pioneer had in 2009. During the 2016 election, Trump, like Palin had figured out years before, used Twitter to influence the news cycle, create headlines, and, most importantly, go around the mainstream media\u2019s and the political establishment\u2019s filters to get information and opinions directly to voters. And as Trump has demonstrated with his CNN-WWE Tweet that went around the world, he is more than willing to use Twitter to get his message directly to the people, challenge and distract the \u201cfake news\u201d media, and make the establishment media look foolish and out of touch when they inevitably overreact and make the story all about them. In fact, Trump has said that his use of \u201csocial media\u201d is \u201cMODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL.\u201d He\u00a0recently told the New York Times\u2019 Mark Leibovich that he will not stop communicating to voters via Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s my voice. They want to take away my voice,\u2019\u2019 Trump told the reporter. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re not going to take away my social media.\u2019\u2019  When Fox News and other outlets released unfavorable polls about Palin leading up the 2012 election cycle, Palin famously dismissed them, saying that \u201cpolls are for strippers and cross-country skiers.\u201d She was right. What inside-the-box consultants and equally incurious legacy media dunces have never realized is the importance of \u201csocial desirability bias\u201d when\u00a0unconventional, controversial, or historical candidates are polled. To put it simply, voters may be reluctant to tell pollsters that they actually support someone like Palin or Trump when they actually do because they think such support will render them socially undesirable. Breitbart News\u2014based on interviews with voters around the country and this writer\u2019s personal \u201cfocus group\u201d of sorts of working-class friends and their family members whose opinions and impressions of candidates have been over the years uncannily representative of the Reagan Democrat swing voters who voted for Obama and then switched to Trump\u2014wrote extensively about\u00a0the potential for a \u201creverse-Bradley effect\u201d during the 2016 election cycle when national polls had Hillary Clinton out in front. Trump even alluded to Breitbart News\u2019 stories on the reverse-Bradley effect multiple times on the stump. Thomas Edsall actually wrote about social desirability bias\u2014 \u201cthe desire of respondents to avoid embarrassment and project a favorable image to others\u201d\u2014in the New York Times last year as well, concluding that \u201cthe simple fact that Trump has beaten the odds so far means that it is not beyond the realm of possibility that he could beat them again.\u201d \u201cIf he does take the White House, much, if not all, of his margin of victory will come from voters too ashamed to acknowledge publicly how they intend to cast their vote,\u201d Edsall wrote. And that is exactly what happened. Polls have underestimated the actual support for politicians like Barack Obama, Palin, and Trump, and it seems like their spouses were actually among the\u00a0few who understood the importance of social desirability bias in polling. Michelle Obama, for instance, knew that black voters who may not have felt comfortable telling pollsters they supported his candidacy would come home to Obama even when polls had him massively trailing Hillary Clinton in South Carolina in the early stages of the 2008 election cycle. Todd Palin also knew that if Palin had run, voters who did not want to tell properly-sounding pollsters that they supported Palin for fear that they would get ridiculed and ostracized would also swarm voting booths to support her. And Melania Trump also knew that Trump\u2019s low poll numbers with the GOP base would rocket up as soon as he actually announced his candidacy. While the mainstream media were mocking Palin, she delivered two of the most important and substantive speeches of the 2012 election cycle that pushed the GOP away from the cronyism and foreign policy interventionism associated with the Bush era. In Iowa, Palin threw down against\u00a0the corporatism and cronyism associated with the likes of Tom DeLay, Dennis Hastert, and the infamous \u201cK-Street\u201d project that contributed significantly to the GOP losing control of all three branches of government last decade. Palin injected ideas like \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d and fighting the \u201cpermanent political class\u201d into the political bloodstream in a way other reformers who lacked her wattage and star power could never do. In Indianola, Iowa, in August of 2011, Palin, explaining the important\u00a0difference between being pro-free markets and pro-big business,\u00a0said: This is not the capitalism of free men and free markets, of innovation and hard work and ethics, of sacrifice and of risk. No, this is the capitalism of connections and government bailouts and handouts, of waste and influence peddling and corporate welfare. This is the crony capitalism that destroyed Europe\u2019s economies. It\u2019s the collusion of big government and big business and big finance to the detriment of all the rest \u2013 to the little guys. It\u2019s a slap in the face to our small business owners \u2013 the true entrepreneurs, the job creators accounting for 70% of the jobs in America, it\u2019s you who own these small businesses, you\u2019re the economic engine, but you don\u2019t grease the wheels of government power. So, do you want to know why the permanent political class doesn\u2019t really want to cut any spending? Do you want to know why nothing ever really gets done? It\u2019s because there\u2019s nothing in it for them. They\u2019ve got a lot of mouths to feed \u2013 a lot of corporate lobbyists and a lot of special interests that are counting on them to keep the good times and the money rolling along. Three months before, in May of 2011, Palin went to Colorado Christian University in Lakewood, Colorado, and moved the GOP away from neoconservatism to realism.\u00a0In Colorado, Palin outlined her five-point plan that included: committing forces only when \u201cvital American interests\u201d are at stake; fighting to win with overwhelming force if America has to\u00a0go to war; having clearly defined goals and objectives before sending troops into war zones; making sure American soldiers are never put under foreign command; and ensuring that sending Americans soldiers is always the last resort. \u201cWe are not indifferent to the cause of human rights or the desire for freedom. We are always on the side of both,\u201d Palin said after laying out her doctrine. \u201cBut we can\u2019t fight every war. We can\u2019t undo every injustice around the world. But with strength and clarity in those five points, we\u2019ll make for a safer, more prosperous, more peaceful world because as the U.S. leads by example, as we support freedom across the globe, we\u2019re going to prove that free and healthy countries don\u2019t wage war on other free and healthy countries. The stronger we are, the stronger and more peaceful the world will be under our example.\u201d In 2016, Trump ran as a candidate who opposed George W. Bush\u2019s Iraq war and nonsensical interventions abroad. Even\u00a0Foreign Policy acknowledged\u00a0Trump\u2019s coherent realism: Trump has little time for either neoconservatives or liberal interventionists; he thinks they allow their belief in American virtue to blind them to both America\u2019s core interests and the limits of American power. He has even less time for multilateralist diplomats: They\u2019re too willing to compromise, trading away American interests in exchange for platitudes about friendship and cooperation. And he has no time at all for those who consider long-standing U.S. alliances sacrosanct. To Trump, U.S. alliances, like potential business partners in a real-estate transaction, should always be asked: \u201cWhat have you done for me lately?\u201d In his inimitable way, Trump is offering a powerful challenge to many of the core assumptions of Washington\u2019s bipartisan foreign-policy elite. And if mainstream Democrats and Republicans want to counter Trump\u2019s appeal, they need to get serious about explaining why his vision of the world isn\u2019t appropriate \u2014 and they need to do so without merely falling back on tired clich\u00e9s. Trump also self-funded his campaign during the primary to show voters that he would not be beholden to lobbyists and big-money influencers who got the better of many GOP lawmakers in the Bush era when Washington, D.C. officially became the country\u2019s \u201cBoomtown.\u201d Americans who were fed up with cronyism in D.C. and ill-advised adventures abroad that cost too many American lives gave Trump the benefit of the doubt and gave the outsider businessman a chance in 2016. But had the legacy media been paying attention to how much Palin\u2019s words were resonating, they would not have been so surprised and blindsided by Trump\u2019s popularity. Before Trump ran against the D.C. \u201cswamp,\u201d Palin eviscerated the permanent political class and politicians who came to D.C. looking to change it and instead saw the \u201ccesspool of corruption\u201d as a big \u201chot tub.\u201d Speaking at the Conservative\u00a0Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2012,\u00a0Palin said: Yeah, the permanent political class \u2013 they\u2019re doing just fine. Ever notice how so many of them arrive in Washington, D.C. of modest means and then miraculously throughout the years they end up becoming very, very wealthy? Well, it\u2019s because they derive power and their wealth from their access to our money \u2013 to taxpayer dollars. They use it to bail out their friends on Wall Street and their corporate cronies, and to reward campaign contributors, and to buy votes via earmarks. There is so much waste. And there is a name for this: It\u2019s called corporate crony capitalism. John Hayward wrote at the time that after \u201cdenouncing the cesspool of corruption\u201d in D.C., Palin said it becomes \u201cmore like a hot tub\u201d for elected officials after a year or two. \u201cAnd they\u2019re hopping in and enjoying the Jacuzzi!,\u201d Palin said, adding that it was \u201ctime we drain the jacuzzi and throw the bums out with the bath water.\u201d Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d was one of his most effective catchphrases during the 2016 election cycle that earned him the trust of voters who for decades have distrusted establishment politicians from both political parties.  Establishment Republicans immediately saw Palin as a threat right after Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) lost the 2008 presidential election to Barack Obama. Here\u2019s video of a jealous and threatened then-Texas Governor Rick Perry cutting off Palin\u2019s press conference at a November 2008 Republican Governors Association event\u00a0when it was obvious Palin was outshining all of them. It took the\u00a0\u201cprofessional conservatives\u201d a bit longer (May, 2010) to know that Palin was a threat to them and their ability to influence elections. For months, Erick Erickson and Red State plodded along to help Nikki Haley win South Carolina\u2019s GOP gubernatorial primary in 2010. But Haley was stuck in third until Palin endorsed her in May of 2010. Haley then rocketed to the top of the field, won the nomination, and went on to be South Carolina\u2019s governor. \u00a0A Republican operative who worked on a rival campaign told Peter Hamby, who was then at CNN and is now directing news for Snapchat, that Palin\u2019s event alone generated \u201cover a million dollars\u201d in media coverage and \u201cthere was absolutely no way when that endorsement came down to break through the news cycle.\u201d \u201cIt was an earned media blowtorch,\u201d the GOP operative later\u00a0had to admit to Hamby. And just like that, the professional conservatives were both jealous and threatened and started to undermine Palin going forward.\u00a0Palin needed neither them nor the establishment to influence primary elections and raise money. As establishment Republican Haley Barbour told Hamby, Palin could have raised enough money to \u201cburn a wet mule\u201d without the help of consultants had she chosen to enter the 2012 presidential contest. Of course, as always, the GOP establishment and the legacy media were more than thrilled, just like they would be when nearly the exact same group of people who hated Palin became the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement, when professional \u201cconservatives\u201d who, for various self-serving reasons, wanted Rick Perry to win the 2012 GOP presidential nomination did all they could to needlessly trash Palin and her supporters. When Trump entered the presidential\u00a0field,\u00a0the very same establishment Republicans and professional conservatives, proving how clueless they were about GOP voters they demeaned as \u201clow-information\u201d rubes because they were not versed in obscure D.C. minutiae, said Trump would not even get enough support to make the main debate stage. When Trump started to lead in every poll, they collectively lost their minds. Erickson and many of his \u201cRed State\u201d allies in the\u00a0\u201cprofessional conservative industrial complex,\u201d many of whom apparently had no issues shilling for Malaysia while not disclosing the payments they received to their readers\u00a0until they were caught red-handed, joined Glenn Beck and his minions to oppose Trump. Establishment Republican hacks like Ana Navarro and Rick Wilson made common cause with them to form the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement. The \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement was more about the \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d scratching and clawing to find excuses to get on television and be quoted in legacy media outlets in order\u00a0for\u00a0the legacy media to use them as their useful idiots against Trump and his \u00a0working-class supporters, whom these professional so-called \u201cinfluencers\u201d have treated with nothing but disdain. It is fitting that National Review, which was essentially the outlet of choice for Paul Ryan\u2019s and Eric Cantor\u2019s brand of establishment Republicanism, published its foolish \u201cNever Trump\u201d issue, which diminished whatever influence the publication had left with working-class voters\u00a0after Trump got elected. For many of these professional operatives and \u201cinfluencers,\u201d many of whom try to relive their junior-high and high-school years in the political world among other dweebs and pipsqueaks, Trump\u2019s rise meant they would not matter as much anymore. And they were not going to lose whatever influence they may have had\u00a0without a fight. Trump, like Palin, did not need overpriced lemmings and \u201cgrundoons\u201d to help him get \u201cliked\u201d by voters. He did not need them to help him get on television or get his message to voters. All Trump had to was hit the \u201csend\u201d button on Twitter. Trump did not even need them for attack ads since Trump neutered his rivals all by himself by naming them \u201cLow-energy Jeb,\u201d \u201cLittle Marco\u201d and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted.\u201d The Hoover Institution\u2019s Alvin Rabushka\u00a0explained why the professional \u201cinfluencers\u201d and operatives detested Trump so much. To put it simply, Trump\u2019s rise to the top of the polls without much campaign spending represented\u00a0an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the \u201cpolitical election industry.\u201d \u201cYou see, it\u2019s not so much that he is running as a Republican that frightens the political establishment,\u201d Rabuska wrote. \u201cIt fears that if he wins, others could seek office in the same way. A Trump victory threatens to put the political industry out of business as it is now.\u201d As Breitbart News noted at the time, Rabushka pointed out that\u00a0\u201cthe political election industry is a multibillion dollar enterprise\u201d and \u201cits ranks include the following\u201d: Consultants.\n\nCoaches.\n\nHandlers.\n\nAd Producers.\n\nFocus Groups.\n\nMedia Pundits.\n\nDonors.\n\nLobbyists. He added that\u00a0\u201cthe industry is used to dominating presidential elections\u201d and \u201cit is the go-to crowd that determines who deserves to be a candidate, win each party\u2019s nomination and ultimately secure the presidency. The industry regards itself as uniquely qualified to determine who is qualified to participate in the political process.\u201d Rabushka said they were particularly livid at Trump because he bypassed this exclusive \u201cclub\u201d: How dare he intrude in the \u201cclub?\u201d How dare he campaign for the presidency without the blessing of the \u201cclub?\u201d\u2026How dare he expose his critics? How dare he use social media to bypass the political industry? How dare he draw large, enthusiastic crowds? How dare he speak the language of the American people instead of the prepped, canned language of the political class? Rabushka continued: How did Claudius become emperor of Rome? After the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorian Guard anointed Claudius emperor. \u201cWhy,\u201d asked Claudius? \u201cBecause,\u201d said the head of the Guard,\u201d without an emperor, there is no need for the Praetorian Guard. Without traditional candidates like Clinton, Bush, Kasich, Huckabee, Christie, Santorum, Pataki and others, there is no need for the Political Establishment\u2019s Praetorian Guard. Trump threatens to undermine the political establishment order of things. To show that \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d are hardly oh-so-principled, it is worth noting\u00a0that the disastrous vehicle they used (the milquetoast Evan McMullin) to get on television, consultant fees, and quotes in legacy media outlets during the 2016 general election is still in debt. As of May of 2017, McMullin\u2019s campaign owed nearly\u00a0$700,000\u00a0to various political professionals. Before Trump started attacking the \u201cfake news\u201d media, Palin effectively branded the legacy media as the \u201clamestream media.\u201d The \u201clamestream media\u201d\u00a0tried to blame Palin for the assassination attempt on then-Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ), mock her supporters, delegitimize her, harass her family, and work with the usual band of usual idiots in the GOP establishment to falsely try to create a narrative that she was losing her influence. Never mind that every Republican who wanted to run for office was begging for her endorsement behind the scenes while Republicans in elected officer were pleading with her camp behind the scenes to not criticize them. No wonder working-class Americans who supported Palin\u2013\u00a0the most \u201cbox office\u201d figure on the right before Trump\u2013began to see the media as even more of a joke as purportedly \u201cobjective\u201d hosts and anchors could not even pretend to hold back the disdain they had for Palin and her supporters. As mentioned above, Palin even used one of her first tweets in 2009 to correct a story in the legacy media that mischaracterized her administration in Alaska. And she ramped up her criticisms against the media as they became more vicious. Palin gave Trump the baton, and Trump has taken it to another level. \u201cThe media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while,\u201d Trump\u2019s chief strategist Steve Bannon told the New York Times earlier this year. \u201cI want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. They don\u2019t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.\u201d Trump, in addition to tweeting the WWE-CNN meme that went around the world, has routinely called out the \u201cfake and fraudulent\u201d media who nitpick at everything and try to find anything they can to delegitimize him. \u201cTheir agenda is not your agenda,\u201d Trump recently said of the \u201cfake news\u201d media. \u201cThe fake media is trying to silence us but we will not let them. The people know the truth. The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I\u2019m president and they\u2019re not.\u201d    Before Trump waged his war against Fox News and Megyn Kelly, Palin clashed with the late Roger Ailes and \u201cBush\u2019s Brain\u201d Karl Rove. Though Palin was a\u00a0Fox News contributor, Ailes, who favored candidates like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Mitt Romney in the 2012 election cycle, strangely went out of his way to undercut his network\u2019s own star while Palin was deciding whether to enter the 2012 presidential contest. Ailes tried to diminish Palin, publicly saying that he hired her solely because Palin was \u201chot and got ratings.\u201d\u00a0And according to New York magazine\u2019s Gabriel Sherman, Ailes reportedly said behind the scenes that Palin was an \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d and did nothing to \u201celevate\u201d the conservative movement even though she had been actively moving the movement away from the corporatism and neoconservatism associated with the Bush dynasty. When Palin decided not to run for president, she returned the favor to Ailes, effectively giving him the middle finger and making her much-anticipated announcement in October of 2011 on Mark Levin\u2019s radio show, royally pissing off Ailes in the process. During the 2016 election cycle, Ailes was just as threatened by Trump. Ailes, according to Sherman, thought Trump was \u201cunelectable\u201d and felt as if he had a duty to \u201csave the country\u201d from Trump. When Megyn Kelly, the talent whom\u00a0Ailes had inexplicably tried to promote as the network\u2019s face, tried to sandbag Trump during the first GOP presidential debate, all hell broke loose. And it was as if Fox News\u2019 viewers who reluctantly gave the network the benefit of the doubt when it attacked Palin, supported amnesty, and hired CNN retreads said, \u201cENOUGH!\u201d As\u00a0Sherman reported, \u201cvirtually 100 percent of the emails were against Megyn Kelly\u201d after the debate, and Ailes was \u201cnot happy\u201d that \u201cmost of the Fox viewers were taking Trump\u2019s side.\u201d Fox News\u2019 battle with Trump showed how out of touch the network\u2019s complacent executives\u00a0were with their core viewers, many of whom watched the network because it was simply the least offensive channel on television where they could get news. As some have semi-jested, Fox News viewers\u00a0even kept their televisions on after Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show and before Sean Hannity\u2019s while they were doing laundry, dishes, housework, or taking out the trash. And in an age when more Americans were getting news from online outlets, Trump showed that Fox News was nowhere near as influential\u00a0as it had been during the last decade before new and social media\u00a0gave voters more ways to get their news In 2010, when the GOP establishment feared Palin would run away with the nomination without having to kowtow to any of them, Barbara Bush threw shade at Palin when she said she hoped Palin would stay in Alaska. \u201cI sat next to her once, thought she was beautiful and I think she\u2019s very happy in Alaska \u2014 and I hope she\u2019ll stay there,\u201d Barbara Bush said. Palin, never afraid to take on the party\u2019s sacred cows, slammed the Bushes for being \u201cblue bloods who want to pick and chose their winners instead of allowing competition to pick and choose the winners.\u201d Radio host Laura Ingraham pointed out then that the \u201celites\u201d like the Bushes were trying to kneecap Palin. Palin also immediately clashed with \u201cBush\u2019s Brain\u201d Karl Rove, Bushism\u2019s top public advocate who reportedly had not \u201cbeen very nice\u201d to Palin \u201cfrom day one\u201d at Fox News, according to Sherman. Make no mistake about it. The Bushes saw Palin as a threat because they knew she would do exactly what Trump ended up doing\u2013eviscerating Bushism. \u00a0In 2016,\u00a0\u201clow energy\u201d and pro-amnesty Jeb Bush\u2019s $100 million war chest could not get him any traction against Trump, who symbolically pummeled him while\u00a0eviscerating any notion that Bushism would be the future of the GOP. While some \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d who never understood Ronald Reagan\u2019s true appeal want to convince people that Trump moved the GOP away from Reaganism, what Trump\u2019s 2016 GOP primary victory and White House victory effectively did was finish what Palin started by driving a stake straight through the heart of Bushism.   After Mitt Romney lost the 2012 election because Reagan Democrats who voted for Obama in 2008 but were disillusioned with Obama four years later could not get themselves to even vote for Romney while holding their noses, the geniuses at Reince Priebus\u2019 and Sean Spicer\u2019s Republican National Committee commissioned a terribly-named \u201cautopsy\u201d report in which the only policy recommendation was amnesty for illegal immigrants. Palin, like Breitbart News, fiercely opposed this nonsense. And she slammed the Gang of Eight\u2019s efforts to pass comprehensive amnesty legislation. She\u00a0was fiercely critical of Obama\u2019s executive amnesties as well. Palin was so lived that she penned an exclusive column for Breitbart News in July of 2014 in which she called for Obama\u2019s impeachment. \u201cNo mas,\u201d she said of Obama\u2019s executive amnesties. On the pages of Breitbart News, Palin blasted Obama\u2019s friendly wealthy bipartisan elite, who she said want \u201ccheap foreign labor and can afford for themselves the best \u2018border security\u2019 money can buy in their own exclusive communities,\u201d for not caring about working-class Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s time to impeach; and on behalf of American workers and legal immigrants of all backgrounds, we should vehemently oppose any politician on the left or right who would hesitate in voting for articles of impeachment,\u201d Palin declared. Palin also said in that Breitbart News column that \u201cwithout borders, there is no nation\u201d and mentioned that many in America now \u201cfeel like strangers in their own land.\u201d As Breitbart News Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak has pointed out, not only did Trump highlight illegal immigration during his presidential launch, Trump rocketed to the top of the GOP field nearly a week after Trump met with the victims of illegal immigrant families after an illegal immigrant murdered Kate Steinle in San Francisco, a city the murderer sought out because it was a sanctuary city. Trump never looked back and his promise to build the wall helped him win over working-class voters in the Rust Belt. In 2015, Breitbart News reported on polling that found that a majority of Americans felt like \u201cstrangers in their own country.\u201d And a post-election study published in the Atlantic magazine found that nearly half of white working-class voters feel like \u201cstrangers in their own land.\u201d Repeatedly on the stump, Trump says that America will not be a country if it does not have borders. Trump won the election while not compromising on illegal immigration, and he even did better among minorities than Romney. In addition, he galvanized working-class white voters, many of whom had either voted for Obama or had not voted in a long time. In fact, a post-election Atlantic/Public Religion Research Institute\u00a0study found that\u00a0that these voters who felt like \u201cstrangers in their own land,\u201d who also felt the \u201cU.S. needs protecting against foreign influence,\u201d were 3.5 times more likely to favor Trump than those who did not share these concerns.  Trump\u2019s celebrity made him a much more powerful candidate than Palin and allowed him to get his message across more effectively and to a wider audience than Palin could have had. It also insulated him better from attacks and criticism while allowing him to more ruthlessly\u00a0attack\u00a0the legacy media. But make no mistake about it, opposing illegal immigration allowed Palin and Trump to galvanize voters who wanted to send a loud and clear message about the importance of melting-pot Americanism (instead of salad-bowl separatism). By supporting Palin and voting for Trump, they were loudly\u2013or silently\u2013voting for E Pluribus Unum (\u201cOut of many, one) instead of Al Gore\u2019s Ex Uno Plures\u00a0(\u201cOut of one, many\u201d).",

      "content": " The ad is directed toward the liberal media and the GOP establishment. It shows Brooks being interviewed on June 14, just a short time after Congressional baseball practice was\u00a0cut short by a Bernie Sanders supporter who opened fire on GOP Congressmen. Reporters put a microphone in Brooks\u2019 face and asked, \u201cDoes this change your views on the gun situation in America?\u201d Brooks responds, \u201cThe Second Amendment right to bear arms is to help ensure that we always have a Republic.\u201d He goes on explain how silly it would be to talk about getting rid of any right simply because a Bernie Sanders supporter\u2014or anyone else\u2014abuses the right. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get rid of the freedom of speech because some people say some really ugly things and hurt other people\u2019s feelings. These rights are there to protect Americans, and while each of them has a negative aspect to them, they are fundamental to our being the greatest nation in world history. So no, I\u2019m not changing my position on any of the rights we enjoy as Americans.\u201d  Brooks\u2019 ad goes on to warn that this is time for standing one\u2019s ground, rather than giving it up. The narrator\u2019s voice says, \u201cToo often, when tragedy strikes, Democrats and the liberal media blame Republicans for the deaths of innocents and use it as an opportunity to take away our Second Amendment rights.\u201d The narrator adds, \u201cThey blamed Sarah Palin for the Gabby Giffords\u2019 shooting\u201d and \u201cthey blamed the NRA for the murder of innocent children at Sandy Hook.\u201d The ad then shows a clip of CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper saying, \u201cSome Democrats are blaming Republicans for selling guns to ISIS.\u201d Tapper\u2019s comments perfectly illustrate Brooks\u2019 concern that the liberal media and Democrats are two sides of the same coin, working in tandem to undermine the freedom Americans enjoy and are able to protect via the Second Amendment. The narrator in Brooks\u2019 ad brings things into clear focus, saying, \u201cWhen Democrats and the liberal media try to undermine our Republic and try to take away our gun rights, we need tough, true conservatives who will take them on. That\u2019s Mo Brooks. Send him to the Senate, and send a message to the liberal media: Our Second Amendment rights are not up for debate.\u201d In other words, we will never give up our guns.

      "subtitle": "null",
      "author": "James P. Pinkerton",
      "content": " First of Three Parts The Power of Party Politics Every high school athletic coach says it for a reason\u2014because it\u2019s true: \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018I\u2019 in \u2018team.\u2019\u201d \u00a0That is, in team sports, each individual, no matter how talented, must work in harmony with the rest of the team; otherwise, the team won\u2019t win. We might add that the same point applies to another kind of team sport: politics. \u00a0There\u2019s no \u201cI\u201d in \u201cparty.\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s the team, the party, that matters most. \u00a0So each party member who wants to win must work cooperatively, so that the team can win. In politics, without the team as a whole, each team member has nothing; they\u2019re just scattered individuals, alone and weak. \u00a0So that\u2019s the choice: Work together and hope to win, or fall part and be sure to lose. We might recall that back during the American Revolution, Ben Franklin described the choice that the American patriots faced: \u201cWe must all hang together,\u201d Franklin quipped grimly, \u201cor we will hang separately.\u201d Today, happily, the situation for Republicans isn\u2019t anywhere near as dire. \u00a0And yet still, as another American Revolutionary patriot, Tom Paine, once put it, \u201cThese are times that try men\u2019s souls.\u201d In particular, the headlines coming from the healthcare debacle in the wee hours of Friday morning are across-the-board discouraging to Team GOP. \u00a0On the left, New York Times columnist David Leonhardt headlined his piece: \u201cPhew: The Health Bill Fails.\u201d \u00a0And on the right, The Washington Examiner\u2019s Philip Klein reluctantly bannered his story, \u201cObamacare is safe.\u201d And somewhere in the vague liberal middle, speaking for the D.C. Beltway, Politico\u2019s \u201cPlaybook\u201d offered its own capitalization-happy take: \u201cHEALTH CARE BILL GOES UP IN FLAMES.\u201d Surveying the wreckage, Republican rank-and-filers might be tempted to break ranks and abandon the team. \u00a0And since party affiliation is voluntary, there\u2019s nothing stopping anyone from giving up. \u00a0Nothing, that is, except the prospect of a guaranteed victory for the other team. So that\u2019s why most Republicans, including activists, will stick around; they feel that they have to do so, to advance what they believe in, and to thwart what they don\u2019t believe in. \u00a0Such common interests are what keep parties, together. Sentiment Is Not a Strategy Yet at the same time, team members deserve the best possible leadership, including the best possible strategy. \u00a0And we can surely agree on this: While individual Republicans fought hard, and while Republican tactics were aggressive, the overall Republican strategy on health care was weak. Yes, Republicans have long been united in opposition to Obamacare, but opposition is a sentiment\u2014it\u2019s not a strategy. With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that Republicans were never together\u2014were never operating as a team\u2014to pursue an effective anti-Obamacare vision. \u00a0Most glaringly, the GOP was long on \u201crepeal\u201d and short on \u201creplace,\u201d even as the country clearly expected both repeal and replace. \u00a0As Reason magazine\u2019s Peter Suderman tweeted in the wake of the health bill crack-up: No repeal. No replace. No skinny repeal. Despite years of promises, Republicans had no shared health policy goals, and it showed. \u2014 Peter Suderman (@petersuderman) July 28, 2017  The American people could see that the GOP knew what it was against, but not what it was for. \u00a0And in politics, like team sports, you need a defense, as well as an offense. \u00a0That is, you need to be able to defend your own plan, not just attack the other guy\u2019s plan. In particular, over the last seven years\u2014since Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law on March 23, 2010\u2014the conservative and libertarian intelligentsia needed to come up with a persuasive Republican narrative for the healthcare issue, including a competent defense of the GOP alternative. \u00a0And that narrative couldn\u2019t just be, Our plan is not as bad as you think. \u00a0It had to be, Our replacement plan is better! And as we all just saw, the critical vulnerability for Obamacare repealers was the issue of the uninsured; all those Congressional Budget Office studies purporting to show that 20 or 30 million Americans would lose their health insurance were wounding, and they went mostly unanswered. \u00a0Faced with devastating math, the strong attackers of past years became the weak defenders this year. In the witty yet wistful words of the Galen Institute\u2019s Doug Badger, \u201c\u2018Repeal and replace\u2019 made Republicans electoral Supermen; \u2018pre-existing conditions\u2019 were their kryptonite.\u201d The Lost Child\u2014and a Lost Teachable Moment So what could Republicans have done differently in the healthcare debate? \u00a0Well, for one thing, they could have reclaimed the mantle of \u201ccompassionate conservatism.\u201d For example, Republicans could have highlighted the tragic case of little Charlie Gard, the desperately sick British infant who became the object of worldwide attention and compassion after the British government\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) chose to write him off. \u00a0Here in the U.S., his case could have been a \u201cteachable moment\u201d for the GOP. We can see that Baby Charlie was the chosen victim of what\u2019s euphemistically called an \u201cend of life decision-making process\u201d\u2014or what might also be called a \u201cdeath panel.\u201d \u00a0That latter phrase, of course, was the evocative coinage, back in 2009, of Sarah Palin. \u00a0As she put it eight years ago: Healthcare by definition involves life and death decisions. \u00a0Human rights and human dignity must be at the center of any health care discussion. Palin, herself the mother of a special-needs child, understood full well that if the government were ever to gain control of health care, \u201cdeath panels\u201d could easily be part of the equation. \u00a0Indeed, in the UK, under the bureaucratic management of the NHS, it\u2019s been estimated that 29 percent of all hospital deaths occur under the dicta of \u201ccare pathways\u201d which are, in fact, non-care pathways. \u00a0They could also be defined as \u201cdeath panels.\u201d This year, many pro-life conservatives, including Republican Members of Congress, took up Charlie Gard\u2019s case, seeking to bring him to the U.S., hopefully to get better medical attention. \u00a0(Charlie died on July 28; just a few days before what would have been his first birthday.) Still, Charlie\u2019s case led some to ask: What about American children with a similar plight? \u00a0Were medically needy kids in the U.S. going to get that sort of humane attention under the Republican healthcare approach? \u00a0If so, that would have been a good thing to highlight; it would have given the Republican effort the sort of kinder, gentler sheen that it was conspicuously lacking. In the absence of such a positive and large-hearted vision\u2014the ennobling spirit that Richard Nixon once called \u00a0\u201cthe lift of a driving dream\u201d\u2014the Republican rationale for the repeal effort seemed to be little more than a glum expression of duty, the need to offer a sacrifice to some austere god of bean-counting. \u00a0The 2017 GOP message could be boiled down to, \u201cWe promised, and so we have to do this.\u201d \u00a0As Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee said of the wearying healthcare vote-slog on July 25, \u201cThe mood is nothing. \u00a0It\u2019s perfunctory.\u201d We can observe that it\u2019s right and proper for a party to attempt to keep its promises. Yet at the same time, the voters have a right to change their collective mind, as new concerns, such as the opioid epidemic, demand new responses. Indeed, over the last six months, out in Middle America, public opinion polls showed support for Obamacare rising to record levels, and the polls also showed that by a 2:1 margin, or even 4:1, people didn\u2019t like what the Republicans were trying to do. Meanwhile, media-savvy opposition to the GOP healthcare effort mushroomed; every day, it seemed, a significant constituency group came out visibly and noisily against the Republicans. \u00a0Indeed, on the news every night, it was opponents, not supporters, who were thronging around Republican lawmakers in the Capitol. \u00a0Of course, one should never discount media bias as a factor in making the left look strong, but the plain fact was that on health care, activists for the left team out-played the right team. Indeed, in light of all this strenuous activism, it\u2019s amazing that the Senate Republicans held together as well as they did. \u00a0As a matter of fact, it\u2019s a tribute to their \u201ccoach,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, that only three GOP Senators\u2014Susan Collins, John McCain, and Lisa Murkowski\u2014peeled off. It had been clear for months that a dozen or more Republican Senators would have been happy if the Obamacare issue had just gone away. \u00a0Yet even so, almost all of them stuck with McConnell, out of loyalty to him and to the team. \u00a0And after the team fell just short of a majority on Friday, McConnell laid it out: What we tried to accomplish for the American people was the right thing for the country and our only regret tonight is that we didn\u2019t achieve\u00a0what we had hoped to accomplish. \u00a0It\u2019s time to move on. Yes, it\u2019s time to move on. \u00a0The wise coach is always mindful that there\u2019s more than one game in a season, and so he doesn\u2019t wear out all his players in the first outing. \u00a0McConnell gave it his best effort\u2014nobody shirked, that\u2019s for sure. \u00a0In the words of The Washington Post\u2019s Paige Winfield Cunningham: McConnell\u2019s chief aim was\u00a0to show he\u2019d tried his darndest to pass an Obamacare repeal bill, that is something the leader appears to have accomplished. Yet now, having tried his darndest, Coach McConnell had to think about the next game, and the game after that, and the rest of the season. \u00a0He called it a day on health care, not because he likes losing, but because he likes winning. \u00a0So, in other words, give the team a chance to recuperate, and pull together with an eye toward \u00a0the next win. Because one thing seems painfully clear enough: The public as a whole doesn\u2019t want to see a victory for anything close to the current Republican healthcare plan. \u00a0A Reuters/Ipsos poll, taken after the Senate vote, found that 64 percent of Americans said they wanted to keep Obamacare either \u201centirely as is\u201d or else see only tweaks in \u201cproblem areas.\u201d \u00a0Indeed, we might note that since January, support for Obamacare has jumped ten points. Reuters further added, only 29 percent of Americans wanted Congressional Republicans to continue their current healthcare course. Needless to say, some might wish to reject this poll as \u201cfake news,\u201d but it seems evident that most lawmakers, in both parties, accept its general outlines. The Democrats, having been crouched down for the past six months in the political equivalent of a \u201cprevent defense,\u201d are now looking to make a deal. In fact, within an hour of the defeat of the healthcare bill, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Ron Wyden, had tweeted out his oft-expressed willingness to parley with the Republicans on health care and other issues. \u00a0And the next day, July 29, came this headline in The Hill: \u201cDems pivot to offering Obamacare improvements.\u201d On the other side of the aisle, in the face of such offers, it will be hard for Republicans to refuse the opportunity to at least explore health improvements. \u00a0Indeed, pragmatic operators such as \u00a0Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma are already in active bipartisan-negotiation mode; it\u2019s a safe bet that they\u2019ll be joined by many other GOPers, eager to carve out a better deals for their constituents. Yes, now that the repeal-siege has been lifted, the majority of lawmakers will resume doing what they most enjoy: wheeling and dealing. \u00a0So, is this a victory for \u201cThe Swamp\u201d? \u00a0Perhaps. \u00a0But it could also be a victory for better health care. Of course, not everyone seems to favor the idea of Congress being Congress. Most notably, at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, President Trump doesn\u2019t seem to be on board with any such pivot to dealmaking. \u00a0Over the weekend, in a flurry of tweets, he criticized the methods of McConnell\u2019s Republican Senate team; he even went so far to assert that \u201cthey look fools\u201d for not \u201cnuking\u201d the legislative filibuster\u2014something McConnell has conspicuously refused to consider. \u00a0As Trump put it: Don\u2019t give up Republican Senators, the World is watching: Repeal & Replace\u2026and go to 51 votes (nuke option), get Cross State Lines & more. Some will note, of course, that the immediate issue on health care had nothing to do with the filibuster. \u00a0Under the arcane \u201creconciliation\u201d rules\u2014which could not include the issue of insurance sales in any case\u2014all McConnell needed was 51 votes\u2014and yet even so, he couldn\u2019t hit that number. \u00a0(Even the best Congressional coaches often find themselves using the phrase \u201cherding cats.\u201d) In fact, the filibuster, as is stands, has deep support from many conservatives. \u00a0Breitbart News\u2019 Joel Pollak, to name one, has politely but firmly defended the filibuster on both political and constitutional grounds. At the same time, a former top aide to Mitch McConnell, Josh Holmes, was decidedly less polite in his response to the President\u2019s tweets; Holmes tweeted that the White House should \u201csearch for the idiot who keeps putting the President on irrelevant and counterproductive crusades.\u201d \u00a0Ouch! We might add that any time a well-connected former Hill aide ventures forth in such a bold manner, onlookers will speculate if that aide is acting at the behest of his former boss. If that were to be the case here, then Holmes\u2019 tweet might be seen as a sort of brushback pitch, aimed at the White House. Indeed, all those who work at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue might do well to remember that Congress, if it chooses to assert itself, has more clout than does the President. \u00a0Indeed, a clue about clout is right there in the Constitution: The powers of the legislative branch are delineated in Article One, while the powers of the executive branch are listed in Article Two. \u00a0As they say in D.C., the President proposes, and Congress disposes. With that in mind, it might be worth noting another tweet from Holmes, calling attention to a quote from him that appeared in The Washington Post after the vote. \u00a0Offering advice on next steps for handling the healthcare issue, Holmes was blunt: Quarantine it \u2026 You can let it destroy your entire agenda and your entire party as a result of inaction by continuing to dwell on something that, frankly, they\u2019ve proven unable to do. In other words, Holmes was saying the same thing that McConnell had said a few hours earlier: It\u2019s time to move on. To be sure, such advice will not sit well with every Republican\u2014including, seemingly, the President. \u00a0Or is that a premature reading of Trump\u2019s ultimate intentions? \u00a0After all, the President prides himself on his flexibility, even unpredictability. So were 45\u2019s tweets over the weekend a signal that he truly wants another round on health care? \u00a0Or were they just the blowing off of some presidential steam, in anticipation of a shift to other agenda items? We\u2019ll take a look at those questions in the next installment.",

      "author": "Kevin Scholla",
      "content": " Today, these words are ringing true once again but we\u2019re not talking about basketball or Danny Ainge. Instead it\u2019s Tanner Ainge, Danny\u2019s son, who\u2019s running for the House of Representatives out of Utah. The three is District 3, which the younger Ainge would represent if elected. Even though it\u2019s not hoops, Ainge is in a fight that would rival NBA action. The good news for Utah is Tanner Ainge is just as tough as his dad. Danny Ainge is known for his work ethic and hard nosed approach to basketball. As a player, he reached the NBA Finals with the Boston Celtics, Portland Trail Blazers, and Phoenix Suns\u2013winning two world championships with the Celts. Ainge added another ring as an executive with Boston in 2008. The former NBA All-Star and current Celtics GM is a winner. Perhaps his greatest achievement however, is what he\u2019s done off the court, Ainge and his wife have raised a beautiful, successful family. The six Ainge kids have all gone on to do special things, with Tanner Ainge\u2019s run for Congress just the latest addition to a long list of achievements. With Jason Chaffetz resigning, a special election is being held in Utah to replace him. After 22 candidates threw their respective hats into the ring, the field has been whittled down to three hopefuls. Tanner Ainge is still standing. Like Donald Trump and Kid Rock, Ainge is an outsider. He\u2019s looking to shake up Washington and break up the status quo. Because he\u2019s an honest man with good intentions, his endorsements have ranged from the political world to the sports world and everywhere in between. Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is backing Ainge. Former Philadelphia Eagles, St. Louis Rams, and BYU star Chad Lewis is on board too. The support for Ainge is vast and varied. People from all walks of life are recognizing DC needs a man with the integrity and grit of an Ainge. When Gordon Hayward left the Utah Jazz for the Celtics, Ainge was put in a tough spot. His hometown team lost their best player to his dad\u2019s squad. Ainge is giving his possible future constituents a chance to take out their frustration. This month, The Ainge For Congress campaign team has set up an event where attendees will have a chance to dunk Danny Ainge into a dunking booth. A good natured, old school promotion to drum up support for Tanner\u2019s run and also let Jazz fans take aim at the man who took their top player. Good stuff from good people, and the best part, it\u2019s all resonating. While Danny Ainge was a star in the NBA he also played some Minor League Baseball and Major League Baseball in the Toronto Blue Jays organization. Because of that unique background the Ainge family has a special appreciation for what Tim Tebow is currently doing in the New York Mets farm system. During an interview on The Palin Update radio program on Mama Grizzly Radio, Tanner Ainge discussed Tebow\u2019s baseball career. \u201cIt speaks to his character and his work ethic\u201d Ainge said regarding Tebow. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to go out there and try something new and succeed. It\u2019s not easy but some of these incredibly gifted athletes can pull it off.\u201d In this in-depth, exclusive interview Ainge tackles the issues head on, discussing his plans for the budget, healthcare, tax reform, jobs, veterans, protecting the homeland, illegal immigration, the Second Amendment, and more. Ainge also talks about what his dad has meant to him and tells Utah voters why he is the right man for the job. The overall message: The Beehive State would do well to pick Ainge for change. Just like his father showed us on the basketball court at BYU and in the pros, this Brigham Young product has the tenacity it takes to deliver for Utah on the grandest of stages.

Gabby Giffords (D-AZ) to testify next Wednesday in an evidentiary hearing that legal experts have described as an unusual move that may benefit Palin.",
      "author": "Tony Lee",
      "content": " On Thursday evening,\u00a0David McCraw, deputy general counsel for the Times, \u201csaid the witness would be James Bennet, The Times\u2019s editorial page editor,\u201d according to a Times\u00a0report. After House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) and three others were shot while practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game by James Hodgkinson\u2014the shooter who had expressed support for Bernie Sanders and hatred for conservatives and President Donald Trump\u2014the Times promptly published an editorial that falsely accused Palin of creating an atmosphere of \u201cpolitical incitement\u201d that led to Giffords\u2019 assassination attempt. The Times said Palin was part of a \u201csickeningly familiar pattern\u201d of political violence before accusing her of inciting Jared Lee Loughner to shoot Giffords. It turned out that Lougner was apolitical and even the Times acknowledged in a 2011 article that \u201cno direct or clear link between political rhetoric and Loughner\u2019s actions could be claimed.\u201d After being smeared by the Times, Palin sued for defamation, alleging that the Times \u201cviolated the law and its own policies\u201d because \u201cat the time of publication, The Times knew and had published pieces acknowledging that there was no connection between Mrs. Palin and Loughner\u2019s 2011 shooting.\u201d The Times is seeking to get the lawsuit dismissed before Palin\u2019s legal team can question\u00a0\u201ctwenty-three non-party current and former Times reporters, editors and other employees\u201d and demand internal communications. Palin\u2019s team, as Breitbart News has reported, is reportedly seeking \u201cdocuments that might reveal, among other things, their \u2018negative feelings\u2019 toward her.\u2028\u201d Judge Jed Rakoff wrote\u00a0in the order\u00a0that \u201cone close question presented by the motion is whether the Complaint contains sufficient allegations of actual malice, an essential element of the claim. To a large extent, determination of that issue may turn on what inferences favorable to the plaintiff are reasonable given the circumstances alleged in the complaint.\u201d He also pointed out that the complaint\u00a0\u201calleges that the allegedly false statements of fact that are the subject of the Complaint were contradicted by information already set forth in prior news stories published by the Times. However, these prior stories arguably would only evidence actual malice if the person(s) who wrote the editorial were aware of them.\u201d The Times\u2018 lawyers will be able to question the writer(s) for no more than 30 minutes. Palin\u2019s lawyers will have a chance to examine the writer(s) for no more than 45 minutes, and the defense will then get no more than 15 minutes of redirect. As Breitbart News has noted, Palin\u2019s lawyers cited the Times\u2019 own articles to argue that the paper knew all along that \u201cthere was no link between Palin and the Giffords shooting.\u201d Palin\u2019s lawyers also \u201ccited a story written by left-wing Times columnist Charles Blow to show that \u2018there is existing hostility held toward\u00a0Mrs. Palin\u2019 and the Gray Lady knows that \u2018her name and attacks upon her inflame passions and thereby drive viewership and Web clicks to media companies.\u2019\u201d \u201cThe Times published the Palin Article with actual knowledge that stories attacking Mrs. Palin inflame passions, which drives viewership and Web clicks,\u201d the complaint\u00a0read.\u00a0\u201cThus, The Times knowingly and voluntarily exploited and retained a benefit conferred by Mrs. Palin, in special circumstances particular to this case in which it would be inequitable for The Times to retain that benefit without paying the value thereof to Mrs. Palin.\u201d The Times is seeking to dismiss the defamation lawsuit by arguing that it simply made an \u201chonest mistake\u201d when it smeared Palin. It took two corrections after heavy backlash from the public for the Times to get the editorial, which was never retracted, factually correct. William Jacobson of Legal Insurrection wrote that Palin\u2019s all-star attorneys \u201cwill seek not only to demonstrate actual knowledge, but also such reckless disregard for the truth as to establish actual malice\u201d: How could the authors of the Editorial not at least do a search of the NY Times itself? And as to the members of the Editorial Board in whose name the Editorial appeared, but who may not have been \u201cauthors\u201d of it, why should their knowledge or lack thereof be ignored. \u201cMake no mistake, however, this is a gift to Palin\u2019s team. They get what they normally are not entitled to at this stage \u2014 testimony. That testimony, though limited in time, could be a goldmine of information,\u201d he continues. \u201cMedia defendants usually win these motions to dismiss on the papers. That the Times has not yet done so should give the Palin team encouragement.\u201d",

Their eyes are shaped differently. Their speech patterns are different. Those things that make them so unique make the world more unique and more beautiful and to try to snuff out their life in the name of building a perfect race or a perfect country, that hearkens back to Neo Nazi, Germany when they tried the same.

      "subtitle": "Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin endorsed Danny Tarkanian for the U.S. Senate in Nevada, an endorsement Palin and Tarkanian provided to Breitbart News exclusively ahead of its public release.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " \u201cDanny Tarkanian is a conservative outsider who will support the \u2018America First\u2019 policies our nation needs to survive and thrive, including building the border wall, ending sanctuary cities, and finally repealing Obamacare,\u201d Palin said in the statement endorsing Tarkanian, provided exclusively to Breitbart News. \u201cCommonsense Conservatives in Nevada and across America need to unite and help win this critical fight. I strongly endorse Danny Tarkanian for the United States Senate and look forward to helping him win this important election.\u201d Tarkanian responded by thanking Palin, and pledging to stand up for President Donald Trump in a way that incumbent career politician Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) has not. \u201cI thank Governor Palin for her endorsement and appreciate the confidence she has shown in our campaign,\u201d Tarkanian said. \u201cI will hold Dean Heller accountable for turning his back on Nevadans by voting against the repeal of Obamacare and helping Hillary Clinton win Nevada by attacking Donald Trump over and over again.\u201d Tarkanian\u2019s race against Heller comes as Heller, a far-outside-the-mainstream establishment Republican, has not stood with President Trump on most issues. For instance, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Heller \u201cbragged about his dissent against the Republican-backed health reform bills\u201d and he \u201cstated he would continue to uphold\u201d support for former President Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive amnesty for illegal alien youths. In addition, Heller announced his opposition to the idea that President Trump would pardon Arizona\u2019s former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. \u201cI\u2019m not from Arizona, I see this from a distance and I read it, so on, so forth,\u201d Heller said of Trump\u2019s position on Arpaio, per the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \u201cBut I just want to make the point that the president was going to come to Phoenix yesterday and pardon him, and chose not to do so. And I certainly hope that\u2019s the position that he has in the future.\u201d When Trump was in Phoenix on Tuesday night, he hinted at a looming pardon he plans to grant Sheriff Joe. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll make a prediction: I think he\u2019s going to be just fine,\u201d Trump said in the Phoenix speech. \u201cOK? But I won\u2019t do it tonight, because I don\u2019t want to cause any controversy.\u201d Unlike Heller, though, Tarkanian supports the president when it comes to Arpaio. \u201cThe President had very good things to say about Sheriff Joe Arpaio last night (Tuesday) in Arizona and if he makes the decision to pardon Arpaio, then I will strongly endorse and support that decision. It is wrong for Dean Heller to publicly oppose the President\u2019s action even before the President has formally announced his decision,\u201d Tarkanian said per local news reports. Heller also, per CNN, announced after the Senate failed to repeal and replace Obamacare that he was \u201cpleased\u201d with how it turned out. \u201cI wake up every morning trying to figure out what\u2019s best for the state of Nevada, what can I do for Nevada families. And obviously we got in the middle of this health care battle and I feel real pleased at the way this thing turned out and we\u2019re turning the page now to tax reform,\u201d Heller said after Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) switched to voting against efforts to repeal Obamacare. Polling data on the race suggests that Tarkanian has a chance to topple Heller in Nevada, should he gain momentum moving into the next several months. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, is likely to fight as hard as he can to save Heller\u2014but endorsements from major national conservative figures like Palin open the door to a potential upset. Palin\u2019s endorsement of Trump in Iowa before the caucuses last year was critical in solidifying the president\u2019s position with conservatives. Trump came in second in Iowa\u2019s caucuses to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) but went on to win the primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina and then stormed his way to the GOP nomination and then the presidency.",

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " Palin\u2019s endorsement of Moore\u2014the former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court\u2014ahead of the Sept. 26 runoff is a huge momentum booster for the conservative candidate as he extends his commanding lead in the polls over Strange. \u201cGlad he\u2019s running and am honored to endorse Judge Roy Moore for the US Senate,\u201d Palin said in the endorsement statement. \u201cJudge Moore has shown he has what it takes to stand up to the out-of-touch political establishment. The Judge has proven he\u2019s not afraid of a fight for what is right, and he\u2019s ready to take on DC\u2019s swamp monsters and help make America great again. We need more bold leaders like Judge Moore who will fight for all of us in the US Senate.\u201d Moore, in response, thanked Palin for the endorsement and said he was honored to have it. \u201cI am honored to have the endorsement of Governor Sarah Palin,\u201d Moore said. \u201cGovernor Palin has a strong record of speaking out for conservative causes and standing up to the Washington establishment. Having her support shows how conservatives across the country are uniting behind our campaign to send a message to Mitch McConnell and the Washington elites who are trying to buy this election.\u201d Moore, in two separate recent polls, has taken a commanding lead over Strange after the Aug. 15 primary heading into the Sept. 26 runoff. A JMC Analytics survey has Moore at 51 percent and Strange lagging significantly far behind at 32 percent. A Decision Desk HQ poll has Strange down around 32 percent and Moore over 50 percent as well. To mitigate the damage, Strange\u2019s and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s allies at the vehemently anti-Trump Senate Leadership Fund fabricated a new push poll showing Moore up four points over Strange\u2014leading Strange 45 percent to 41 percent. The survey conducted at the McConnell group Senate Leadership Fund\u2019s behest by pollster Jan van Lohuizen was conducted from Aug. 21 to Aug. 23, surveying 601 GOP voters with a margin of error of four points. The fact that they could not even produce a push poll that shows the candidate they support, Strange, in the lead is a stark admission of just how badly Strange\u2019s campaign is doing in Alabama. Strange\u2019s allies leaked the push poll to the Washington Examiner\u2019s David Drucker, a writer who often sides with the GOP establishment. The Senate Leadership Fund is run by Steven Law, an anti-Trump GOP establishment activist who has worked alongside Karl Rove at American Crossroads. President Trump thinks very lowly of Rove, telling Breitbart News in an April 2016 interview that Rove is a \u201cdishonorable guy.\u201d Trump believes that Rove should not be allowed to write for the Wall Street Journal,\u00a0as he is so \u201cdishonorable,\u201d and Law\u2019s and Senate Leadership Fund\u2019s deep ties to Rove only hurt Strange more than he is already hurting in the race. What\u2019s more, Strange and his allies are planning\u2014sources close to them tell Breitbart News\u2014a series of smear tactics against Moore in the final weeks. The attacks are likely to revive old and baseless charges against Moore, these sources say\u2013something Moore is ready for, given the fact that the Washington establishment has already dumped more than $10 million into Alabama on behalf of the failing Strange\u2019s campaign. In an interview with Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 this past weekend, Moore said he was ready for the onslaught of false attacks from Strange and his D.C. allies. \u201cI think $14 million is exactly the problem they got, but with the results they got they better start wondering when they\u2019re going to stop throwing away their money,\u201d Moore told Breitbart News Sunday. \u201cAttack ads aren\u2019t working in this state. It\u2019s obvious when an opponent attacks both of his opponents with negative ads or even one, but both opponents? They\u2019ve been trying to manipulate this race from the very beginning and they\u2019ve simply failed. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re planning in the future. I expect they\u2019re going to continue to come up and present some negative ads that are false in their nature because they got the money to do it and they know we\u2019re strapped with money. But still, God has given the people vision to see through this.\u201d Strange\u2019s decision to align himself against President Trump on the issue of whether to eliminate the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the U.S. Senate when it comes to passing legislation further complicates matters. Moore stands firmly with President Trump, against McConnell, in believing that the filibuster rule should be eliminated. Strange actually joined dozens of other establishment senators from both the GOP and Democratic Party in writing a letter to McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer earlier this year opposing the president and pushing for no changes to the rules. Strange\u2019s campaign spokeswoman Shana Teehan has not responded when asked if the senator regrets signing that letter or would like to remove his name from the anti-Trump document. Moore, meanwhile, is 100 percent with Trump on changing the Senate rules. \u201cI think the people should understand that this is a rule\u2014it\u2019s not a Constitutional rule, it\u2019s a Senate rule,\u201d Moore told Breitbart News Sunday. \u201cThe Founding Fathers described when they preferred super majorities on things like vetoes of presidents, overriding a veto, or expelling a member from one of the two houses of Congress or passing a Constitutional amendment. They have a super majority rule which is simply a rule of anything over a majority which is one over half. It\u2019s not in the Constitution. Quite frankly, it\u2019s unconstitutional. And it\u2019s preventing many bills from going through the Senate. They can\u2019t even get to the floor because of the filibuster rule. A filibuster is different. That\u2019s when you protest bills and speak against them. They can have ways to get that restricted but they can\u2019t put a 60-vote rule and cling to that and say that\u2019s what the Constitution says\u2014it isn\u2019t.\u201d Strange, whose campaign is struggling to gain momentum, has refused to appear on Breitbart News radio on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 to discuss his campaign. It is unclear why he is refusing to talk to conservatives who support the president. Palin\u2019s move to endorse Moore comes after she endorsed Danny Tarkanian against Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in Nevada\u2019s GOP primary earlier on Thursday, also in a Breitbart News exclusive.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " The march is apolitical, says Kimberly Fletcher, executive director and event organizer of Mom\u2019s March for America. Appearing as a guest on Breitbart News Sunday, Fletcher explained: It\u2019s not about parties, politics, or a president. It\u2019s about principles, and the principles we care about as mothers. We agree a whole lot more than we don\u2019t. We want our children to be safe, we want them to get a good education, and we want them to be happy, which, in mother language, equates to decent people who can provide for themselves. Mothers will be gathering on Saturday, September 23 in Omaha, Nebraska, at the Ralston Arena, in the heartland of the nation. The event will be broadcast live, with similar gatherings taking place all over the country. Guest speakers will include Sarah Palin, Candy Carson (wife of Dr. Ben Carson), and Missy Roberts of Duck Dynasty. Fletcher, the wife of a retired Air Force officer and mother of eight children, describes the event as a \u201ccultural march,\u201d rather than a walk down a street with people carrying signs and shouting chants. \u201cThe mission is to celebrate the status of mothers \u2013 their influence,\u201d she said, continuing: We have powerful influence in our homes, communities, and nation. This idea that motherhood is secondary \u2013 regardless of whether or not you\u2019re working outside the home, you\u2019re a stay-at-home-mom \u2026 It\u2019s not about whether or not you work outside the home, it\u2019s about whether or not you\u2019re putting motherhood first in your life and whether or not you\u2019re respected as a mother. In an overview of the Mom\u2019s March, Fletcher, the president and founder of Homemakers for America writes, \u201cLike many of the mothers in America, I have become very concerned with the decline in our culture and the anger, hate and violence flooding our nation.\u201d Through the Mom\u2019s March, she asserts women will \u201cstand together for truth, family, freedom, and the Constitution that protects our divine rights as mothers.\u201d \u201cMothers set the bar, women set the bar in our nation on decency, humanity, civility, and it\u2019s time to raise the bar, and we\u2019re coming together to do it,\u201d Fletcher states. Fletcher and the Mom\u2019s March invite mothers to sign the Declaration of Mothers. In a Mom\u2019s March media release, Fletcher observes a statement from Melinda Gates and the foundation she presides over with her husband, Bill Gates. \u201cThe real issue isn\u2019t how much time women spend on unpaid work\u2014it\u2019s how much time they don\u2019t spend contributing to society and pursuing higher education or a career,\u201d Gates said, adding that, given the chance, women would \u201cspend more time doing paid work, starting businesses, or otherwise contributing to the economic well-being of societies around the world.\u201d \u201cThe fact that they can\u2019t holds their families and communities back,\u201d she added. Fletcher responds, \u201cThis is not only incredibly belittling to mothers; it completely disregards the fact that the most influential person in society is the mother because of her influence in the home.\u201d \u201cLook at what everybody is targeting,\u201d she told Breitbart News Sunday host Matthew Boyle. \u201cGo back in history. Hitler, Stalin, any of the great dictators of the world, the first thing they went after was the home, the family, the churches \u2013 pull the children away. If we aren\u2019t that important, why is it we\u2019re constantly being targeted?\u201d \u201cThose who would destroy our country and our culture, know very much how powerful our influence is,\u201d she asserts. \u201cWe stand right in the way between the agenda they want to achieve and our children. Children are the future, and if they can reach their hearts and their minds, then they own the future.\u201d For further information about the Mom\u2019s March, visit momsmarchusa.com ",

      "subtitle": "Federal Judge Jed S. Rakoff dismissed former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin\u2019s defamation lawsuit against the New York Times on Tuesday.",
      "author": "Tony Lee",
      "content": " \u201c[I]f political journalism is to achieve its constitutionally endorsed role of challenging the powerful, legal redress by a public figure must be limited to those cases where the public figure has a plausible factual basis for complaining that the mistake was made maliciously, that is, with knowledge it was false or with reckless disregard of its falsity,\u201d Rakoff wrote in his 26-page opinion. \u201cHere, plaintiff\u2019s complaint, even when supplemented by facts developed at an evidentiary hearing convened by the Court, fails to make that showing. Accordingly, the complaint must be dismissed.\u201d Palin sued the Times for defamation in Manhattan federal court in the Southern District of New York after the Times published a June editorial hours after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) was shot on a baseball field in which it, as Breitbart News noted, \u201cfalsely accused Palin of inspiring Jared Lee Loughner in his assassination of attempt of former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ) in 2011.\u201d There has never been a shred of evidence whatsoever to even suggest that Loughner, who was apolitical, was inspired by Palin or the Tea Party. Yet, the Times alleged Palin was responsible for the \u201cpolitical incitement\u201d that caused Loughner to open fire at Giffords\u2019 event: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. The Times issued two subsequent corrections, and, in the complaint, Palin\u2019s lawyers cited the Times\u2019 own articles and \u201cargued that the Times knew there was no link between Palin and the Giffords shooting.\u201d As Breitbart News noted, Palin\u2019s legal team\u00a0also \u201ccited a story written by left-wing Times columnist Charles Blow to show that \u2018there is existing hostility held toward\u00a0Mrs. Palin\u2019 and the Gray Lady knows that \u2018her name and attacks upon her inflame passions and thereby drive viewership and Web clicks to media companies.\u2019\u201d \u201cThe Times published the Palin Article with actual knowledge that stories attacking Mrs. Palin inflame passions, which drives viewership and Web clicks,\u201d the complaint\u00a0read.\u00a0\u201cThus, The Times knowingly and voluntarily exploited and retained a benefit conferred by Mrs. Palin, in special circumstances particular to this case in which it would be inequitable for The Times to retain that benefit without paying the value thereof to Mrs. Palin.\u201d Rakoff did not buy the Times\u2019 arguments that \u201cthe challenged statements are not \u2018of and concerning\u2019 plaintiff\u201d and that \u201cthe challenged statements are not provably false.\u201d But he noted that \u201cpublic figures who seek damages for defamatory statements must,\u00a0however, do more than prove that the statements about them were false. They must also prove by \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 that the statements were made with \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u2013 that is, with knowledge that the statements were false or with reckless disregard as to their falsity.\u201d Rakoff wrote that Palin\u2019s \u201ccomplaint fails on its face to adequately allege actual malice, because it fails to identify any individual who possessed the requisite knowledge and intent and, instead, attributes it to the Times in general. This will not suffice.\u201d \u201cIt is not the Times\u2018 collective knowledge and intent that is relevant but rather [the Times editorial page editor James] Bennet\u2019s,\u201d he wrote. The Times argued that it had simply made an \u201chonest mistake\u201d even though, as Rakoff acknowledged, its editorial board \u201cis not a fan of Mrs. Palin.\u201d A reportedly \u201canguished\u201d\u00a0Bennet, who was The Atlantic\u2018s editor before joining the Times in 2016, claimed during the evidentiary hearing that a Times editorial writer in Washington, DC wrote the first draft of the editorial, which Bennet then apparently decided to nearly completely re-write on his own. Bennet also testified that he hastily added the words \u201cpolitical incitement\u201d because he was \u201clooking for a very strong word to write about the political climate because I wanted to get our readers\u2019 attention.\u201d According to Politico, \u201clawyers for Palin asked Bennet, whose brother Michael is a Democratic senator in Colorado, whether he knew that Colorado Democratic Congress members who endorsed his brother in 2016 had been listed as targets on the 2011 map, or whether he remembered that a PAC associated with Giffords, advocating gun control, had endorsed his brother\u2019s re-election.\u201d Bennet reportedly \u201csaid he did not remember or recall those circumstances at the time he was rewriting the editorial.\u201d Palin\u2019s lawyer, according to HuffPost, also \u201casked if Bennet recalled a 2011 dispute between commentator Andrew Sullivan \u2015 whose \u2018Daily Dish\u2019 blog was then published by The Atlantic \u2015 and a Financial Times writer over linking Palin to the Giffords shooting. Bennet, who was The Atlantic\u2019s top editor at the time, said he didn\u2019t recall the matter when he was rewriting the Times editorial.\u201d Rakoff wrote that Palin\u2019s lawyers \u201cfailed to identify an individual with actual malice\u201d and, as \u201cto hostility, the best that plaintiff can muster is that Mr. Bennet has a long association with liberal publications and that his brother is the Democratic senator from Colorado who was endorsed by Congresswoman Giffords\u2019 political action committee in his 2016 election and whose opponent was endorsed by Mrs. Palin in that same election.\u201d The judge also bought Bennet\u2019s testimony in which he claimed complete ignorance regarding one of the most seminal political events in recent memory. Rakoff wrote that \u201call these articles appeared years earlier, and there is no reason to suppose that, even if Bennet had read them at the time, he would necessarily remember their conclusions, especially since, as the complaint itself notes, there were also articles that appeared shortly after the Loughner shooting that drew contrary conclusions.\u201d \u201cWhat we have here is an editorial, written and rewritten rapidly in order to voice an opinion on an immediate event of importance, in which are included a few factual inaccuracies somewhat pertaining to Mrs. Palin that are very rapidly corrected,\u201d Rakoff wrote. \u201cNegligence this may be; but defamation of a public figure it plainly is not.\u201d Because the case was dismissed, Palin\u2019s lawyers will not be able to question\u00a0\u201ctwenty-three non-party current and former Times reporters, editors and other employees\u201d and seek internal Times\u00a0\u201cdocuments that might reveal, among other things, their \u2018negative feelings\u2019 toward\u201d Palin.",

      "author": "Ann Coulter",
      "content": " It\u2019s too late for the likes of Marco Rubio, Mitt Romney, and Paul Ryan to avoid humiliation, but if they don\u2019t want to keep making asses of themselves in public by, for example, praising today\u2019s version of the KKK, they should read my entire corpus of work, starting with Demonic. (Trump somehow grasped the whole point of that book, too.) The reason normal people are suspicious of the media\u2019s narrative on Charlottesville is that we\u2019ve heard this exact same story many, many times before. Facts on the ground: \u2014 Approximately every other year since forever, liberal hooligans have been rampaging through the streets, beating people up, setting off bombs, killing cops, smashing store windows, assassinating politicians and burning down neighborhoods \u2014 against capitalism, Vietnam, Nixon, Wall Street, a police shooting, Trump, Starbucks, a sunny day. \u2014 Conservatives, mostly families, have generally avoided even the mildest forms of political protest, and, when they finally are driven to petition the government over their grievances, they pick up after themselves \u2014 at tea parties, townhalls, Trump rallies and so on. Result: The entire media are constantly on Red Alert for the threat of Right-Wing Violence. The explanation for this apparent madness is that the left \u2014 both the scribblers and the shock troops \u2014 bear all the characteristics of a mob, as set forth more than a century ago by the father of group-think, French psychologist Gustave Le Bon. No behavior of the left is mysterious if you\u2019ve read Le Bon \u2014 or \u201cDemonic.\u201d In The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, Le Bon observed that the \u201ccomplete lack of critical spirit\u201d prevents crowds from \u201cperceiving \u2026 contradictions.\u201d No matter the year or the circumstances, the media and their eunuch politicians are quick to blame any surprising violence on the Right-Wing Nazis of their imaginations \u2014 from Lee Harvey Oswald (communist) to Jared Lee Loughner and James Holmes (psychopaths) to the two stabbing murders on a Portland train earlier this year committed by a Bernie Sanders supporter, whom the media \u2014 to this day \u2014 insist, all evidence to the contrary, was a Trump supporter. When, a few months after the first murders by a Sanders supporter, a second Sanders supporter opened fire on a congressional Republican baseball practice, putting GOP Rep. Steve Scalise in critical condition, that political attack was simply discarded. The media put the story of left-wing assailant James Hodgkinson in a lead casket and dropped it to the bottom of the sea. There are the scores of other examples of imaginary right-wing violence invented by the media \u2014 then quietly abandoned when the facts come out. After weeks of hair-on-fire headlines, suddenly you just stop reading about the Duke lacrosse \u201crapists,\u201d homicidal maniac Officer Darren Wilson or legions of Trump-supporters ripping off Muslim women\u2019s hijabs. But I remember! Here are as many as my word limit allows \u2013- maybe more! SARAH PALIN AND THE RISE OF NAZISM IN AMERICA: During the 2008 campaign, the media were in a perpetual state of fright that racist Republicans would assassinate Barack Obama. Naturally, when a local reporter claimed he\u2019d heard someone in a crowd at a Sarah Palin rally yell, \u201cKill him!\u201d about Obama, the media didn\u2019t wait for more facts! The Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank promptly reported the reed-thin allegation, which was then repeated in hundreds of other news outlets. On CNN, David Gergen said that Palin was \u201cwhipping up these crowds,\u201d creating \u201cugly scenes\u201d with audience members yelling, \u201cKill him. Kill him\u201d \u2014 and also claimed (without evidence) that they were yelling \u201cracial epithets.\u201d A CNN article on the alleged shout-out appeared under the headline: \u201cRage rising on the McCain campaign trail.\u201d Vice presidential candidate Joe Biden weighed in, somberly calling the alleged incident \u201cdangerous.\u201d MSNBC\u2019S Rachel Maddow railed against the \u201cmere mention of killing someone at a political rally,\u201d saying, \u201cit\u2019s horrific.\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Keith Olbermann took the gold, yammering on and on about the claim in nightly updates, culminating in one of his prissiest ever \u201cSpecial Comments,\u201d in which he demanded that John McCain suspend his campaign until \u201cit ceases to be a clear and present danger to the peace of this nation.\u201d Needless to say, the Secret Service undertook a complete review. Agents listened to tapes of the event, interviewed attendees and interrogated the boatloads of law enforcement officers spread throughout the crowd. Conclusion: It never happened. As even the nutty left-wing site Salon noted, \u201cIf (the Secret Service) says it doesn\u2019t think anyone shouted, \u2018kill him,\u2019 it\u2019s a good bet that it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d No apologies, no retractions, no memory. THE TEA PARTY AND THE RISE OF NAZISM IN AMERICA: Remember when polite, hardworking Americans came together to oppose Obamacare at tea party rallies in 2009 and 2010? Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Steny Hoyer called the protesters \u201cun-American.\u201d The Democratic National Committee called them \u201crabid right-wing extremists.\u201d Sen. Harry Reid called the tea partiers \u201cevil-mongers.\u201d Jimmy Carter pronounced an \u201coverwhelming portion\u201d of them racists. ABC called them a \u201cmob.\u201d CNN called them \u201crabble-rousing critics.\u201d Democratic congressman Brian Baird of Washington accused tea partiers of using \u201cclose to Brown-shirt tactics.\u201d The AFL-CIO called them an \u201cextremist fringe,\u201d using \u201cmob rule.\u201d As Le Bon explained, \u201cone of the surest means of making an idea enter the mind of crowds\u201d is to affirmatively state something, \u201cfree of all reasoning and all proof.\u201d Indeed, \u201cthe more destitute of every appearance of proof and demonstration\u201d a claim is, \u201cthe more weight it carries\u201d with a mob. As usual, once the dust had settled, the only violence at the tea parties and town halls had been committed by liberals. On Aug. 6, 2009, for example, a black tea partier was beaten up by union thugs shouting the N-word at him at a St. Louis town hall. Six members of the Service Employees International Union were arrested. About a month later, on Sept. 3, 2009, 65-year-old tea partier Bill Rice had his finger bitten off at a health care rally in Thousand Oaks, California, by a lefty Obamacare supporter. To this day, The New York Times has never mentioned either incident, so it can happily return to railing against the non-existent right-wing rage surging in the red states. THE CENSUS WORKER AND RISE OF NAZISM IN AMERICA: In the fall of 2009, the naked body of Census worker Bill Sparkman was found hanging from a tree in southwestern Kentucky, with the word \u201cfed\u201d written across his chest. Liberals wasted no time in concluding that right-wing extremists had murdered Sparkman in a burst of anti-government hate. A Census worker? Who hates Census workers? Unlike an IRS agent, an EPA inspector or even an agriculture inspector, a Census worker can\u2019t arrest you, seize your property or fine you hundreds of thousands of dollars. They just hand out questionnaires. No matter. The left has been waiting for right-wing violence for centuries and, finally, here it was! New York magazine ran an article about the dead Census worker, asking, \u201cHas Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Fear of Political Violence Been Realized?\u201d The Atlantic\u2019s Andrew Sullivan blamed \u201cSouthern populist terrorism\u201d for Sparkman\u2019s death, \u201cwhipped up by the GOP and its Fox and talk radio cohorts.\u201d But MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow owned the Bill-Sparkman-was-murdered-by-right-wingers story. Night after night, she breathlessly reported this \u201cbreaking national news.\u201d Although Rachel\u2019s main move is giggling and eye-rolling, she was all deadly earnestness when it came to the \u201ctroubling story\u201d and the \u201cworry that he was killed in fact because he was a federal employee.\u201d In case you missed the point, Maddow reminded viewers there\u2019s \u201ca strong suspicion of government generally among people who live in that area.\u201d A month later, investigators announced that Sparkman had committed suicide in an insurance scam. Rachel left it to her guest host, Howard Dean, to break the bad news to her conspiracy-minded viewers, sparing her the humiliation. And then we never heard the story of the Census worker again. A media capable of turning tea partiers, Palin supporters and a random insurance scam into weeks of terror at right-wing violence are not going to let a few nuts waving Nazi flags at a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally pass without leaping at the opportunity to outlaw conservatism. Based on the media\u2019s 100-year history of fantasizing a burgeoning Nazi Party in America, the rest of us would like to wait for the facts on Charlottesville. COPYRIGHT 2017 ANN COULTER",

Danny Tarkanian, son of basketball coaching legend Jerry Tarkanian, is running for U.S. Senate in Nevada. Tarkanian is a strong Trump supporter and his outsider campaign has already earned him the endorsement of the ultimate conservative powerhouse, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.",
      "author": "Kevin Scholla",
      "content": " Things are looking up for Tarkanian, and that means things may be looking up for President Trump and the country. Unlike his primary opponent, incumbent GOP Senator Dean Heller, Tarkanian is truly against Obamacare. Heller had a chance to support a sweeping repeal of the Affordable Care Act but chose to reject that repeal. Because of very non-Republican moves like that, several Republican (in name only) senators are in jeopardy of being ousted in a primary vote. Heller is vulnerable, and the son of \u201cShark\u201d can smell blood. While Heller continuously bashed candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 race for the White House, Tarkanian is proud to let all of Nevada know he is pro-Trump all the way. He also believes his late father would\u2019ve been a Trump man too. \u201cHe\u2019d love President Trump,\u201d Tarkanian said during an appearance on The Palin Update radio program. \u201cMy dad hated phonies. My dad\u2019s biggest line was \u2018You can teach a thief not to steal, you can\u2019t teach a dishonest person to be honest\u2019. He hated phonies more than anything. Donald Trump tells it like it is and he would love somebody that would tell it like it is.\u201d While Tarkanian can only speculate about his dad\u2019s feelings toward Trump, he knows for a fact what \u201cShark\u201d thought of the \u201cMama Grizzly\u201d. \u201cMy dad made a career out of taking junior college transfers and bringing them into his four year program,\u201d Tarkanian said. \u201cWhen he found out that Sarah Palin went to a junior college in Idaho before she went to a university, he was so excited when she was the VP candidate, he said she could be the first JUCO transfer to make it to the White House.\u201d Tarkanian looks back fondly at the amazing teams his dad coached, particularly the 1989-90 National Champion squad and the 1990-91 runners up. Over those two seasons, the Runnin\u2019 Rebels posted a lusty combined record of 69-6. \u201cGreat memories and they were really great people,\u201d said Tarkanian. \u201cMy dad always said Larry Johnson was a better person than he was a basketball player and he was the best basketball player in the country when he was playing at UNLV. Stacey Augmon\u2019s a great guy\u2013hardly ever talks\u2013but he\u2019s such a great guy, a loyal guy.\u201d The UNLV teams a decade before were nothing to sneeze at either. Danny Tarkanian played for his dad from 1981-1984 and the team made multiple NCAA Tournament appearances while capturing conference championships along the way. From Danny Tarkanian\u2019s group to Larry Johnson\u2019s edition, UNLV has had quite a run on the hardwood. \u201cWe had great pride in being a Rebel,\u201d Tarkanian said. \u201cWe worked very, very hard making sure we held the high standards (of the program).\u201d While playing for his father, Danny Tarkanian averaged almost nine assists per game. Now, this husband, father, and businessman looks to dish out a huge assist to President Trump and the nation by ejecting Senator Heller who is way over the foul limit.

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " What we did not know about Quinn, because she did not want us to know, is that while The Queen of Pro-Science could not bring herself to believe in God, what she did believe in was the occult, the dark arts, voodoo, and the power of the hex. Quinn believes so strongly in her own witch-like powers, she is certain that she is responsible for the deaths of three people, three innocent people who died after Quinn hit them with a hex. Their crime? Daring to offend the Queen of Pro-Science. Now that we know that Quinn is a practitioner of the dark arts, now that we know who this wicked person (she believes she has the power to murder and has used it) truly is, this important context can better inform what she has written in the past, most especially her venomous attacks on those she sees as apostates: Christian women who want no part of the leftwing plantation. And as we all know, for the last eight years, the number-one target in this regard has been Governor Palin. Displaying a painfully stupid, mind-bogglingly obtuse, and achingly ignorant insight into all-things Christianity, Quinn attacked Palin for \u2014 I swear I am not making this up \u2014 her youthful decision to \u201cput my life in my creator\u2019s hands and trust Him as I sought my life\u2019s path.\u201d Quinn, whose inability to grasp even a rudimentary understanding of Christianity, who comprehends the basics of the faith with the brainpower of a tree stump on meth, just cannot quite reconcile Palin\u2019s decision with a number of beats in the 2008 vice presidential candidate\u2019s life, or the fact that Palin dared write a memoir. The Wicked Witch of D.C.\u00a0asks out loud: Did God plan for her to become Governor of Alaska. If so, did God plan for her to step down. Did God plan for her to run for Vice President? If so why did she and McCain lose? Did God plan for her to have a child with Down\u2019s Syndrome? If so why did she consider an abortion? Did God plan for her to have a huge wardrobe? Then why did she apologize for it? \u2026 You would think that God would ask of her to live her life as an example to others of a compassionate loving, caring person. One of the most powerful examples of God\u2019s love in the Bible is that of forgiveness. Turning the other cheek. But Palin\u2019s book is a screed against everyone who ever done her wrong. At the time, this was one of the stupidest things I had ever read; the entire piece reads like an Onion satire ridiculing the Sally Quinns of our world, the clueless elites who know all the correct things to say and believe but who have no understanding whatsoever of how the real world works, who real people are; no commons sense, no native intelligence, no ability to function as anything resembling a useful human being outside of an event involving cocktails, pretension and backbiting. This is how depraved our Ruling Class is\u2026 Rather than pick up Christianity for Dummies \u2014 which probably on page one explains the basics: the concept of free will, the notion of carving out a spiritual life in God\u2019s natural world; the idea that being a Christian does not mean being a doormat (can someone please tell the Washington Post religion writer about Jesus turning over those money-changer tables); that \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d is an act of defiance (duh); that uncomfortable truths must be spoken out loud, and that God does not reward Christians with awesome lives. In fact, the moment you turn your life over to Him your problems have just begun \u2014 Quinn actually published her raging ignorance for all the world to see. But you see, in her shallow world, a narrow and close-minded place populated with vacuous provincials, cattiness will always trump knowledge and depth and charity. Regardless, what is now important to keep in mind is that Quinn did not write that as a committed non-believer. She lied. She covered up the fact that her demonic attack on Palin was written by a practicing occultist who believes she successfully used her dark powers to murder three people guilty of nothing more than not kissing one of her diamond rings. Quinn\u2019s ridicule was not coming from a place only of ignorance, and it certainly was not coming from a place of inquiry. Rather, it was coming from a dark and unholy place, from an occult priestess using deception to destroy an apostate. This cannot be stressed enough\u2026 Between the Spirit Cooking, Quinn\u2019s occultism, and the dismissive reaction to both from our Thought Leaders, we now know for a fact that many in our Ruling Class are gripped by an unholy desire to summon evil as a means to power \u2014 power over you and I \u2014 to control and organize our lives through central government. This is not a game or a joke. Whether you believe in Satanism, the occult, hexes, voodoo or not, nothing changes the fact that those willing to embrace such a thing are capable of anything, any evil, any betrayal, any deception as a means to get what they want. As I wrote yesterday, Quinn coming out as an occultist explains so, so much. P.S. Did I mention that this hideous woman believes she has the power to murder people and has used that power? \u00a0To me, that just seems like an important insight into her character and the character of all those in her social circle, which is pretty much anyone who is anyone. \u2013 Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.\u00a0 Follow his Facebook Page here.",

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " The event with Palin will be part of a bus tour put on by the Great America Alliance, an organization of grassroots activists solidly in support of the agenda President Trump campaigned on last year. Now former Trump White House aide Andy Surabian, until a couple weeks ago a top hand to now former White House chief strategist and once-again Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon, is a senior adviser to the Great America Alliance. The group is also led by Eric Beach, a top consultant who raised tens of millions of dollars and held dozens of events in battleground states supporting President Trump\u2019s successful White House bid against Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton. Moore faces off against Luther Strange on Sept. 26 in the special election GOP primary runoff for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by former Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) earlier this year, when Sessions left the Senate to serve as President Donald Trump\u2019s Attorney General. \u201cPalin plans to barnstorm Alabama the week prior to the special election to double down on her strongly stated support of Judge Moore,\u201d a source familiar with the former Alaska Governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee\u2019s planning told Breitbart News. \u201cGov. Palin is a conservative rock star and her presence in Alabama is sure to seal the deal for Judge Roy Moore,\u201d said a second source familiar with Palin\u2019s plans. While details are still being hammered out and are expected to be announced soon, the event is going to happen and will likely take place late next week. Palin has already endorsed Moore, in a Breitbart News exclusive, in late August. \u201cGlad he\u2019s running and am honored to endorse Judge Roy Moore for the US Senate,\u201d Palin said in late August. \u201cJudge Moore has shown he has what it takes to stand up to the out-of-touch political establishment. The Judge has proven he\u2019s not afraid of a fight for what is right, and he\u2019s ready to take on DC\u2019s swamp monsters and help make America great again. We need more bold leaders like Judge Moore who will fight for all of us in the U.S. Senate.\u201d Judge Moore said at the time he was excited to have the endorsement of Palin. \u201cI am honored to have the endorsement of Governor Sarah Palin,\u201d Moore said then. \u201cGovernor Palin has a strong record of speaking out for conservative causes and standing up to the Washington establishment. Having her support shows how conservatives across the country are uniting behind our campaign to send a message to Mitch McConnell and the Washington elites who are trying to buy this election.\u201d Now that Palin is going big, traveling all the way to Alabama to campaign for Judge Moore, she is doubling down on that endorsement and seeing to it that Moore makes it across the finish line into the GOP nomination\u2014from where he is expected to easily defeat Democrat Doug Jones and make it into the U.S. Senate. It is very notable that Palin is willing to campaign for Judge Roy Moore, who is winning in the polls right now with a commanding well-into-double-digits lead over Luther Strange. Strange\u2019s highest profile endorser, President Trump, has\u2014per one White House official who spoke to Breitbart News late Wednesday evening\u2014no plans at this time to help Strange by hitting the campaign trail for him in Alabama. Most recent polls of the runoff in Alabama show Moore leading Strange by either 14 or 15 points, and Trump has been made aware of Strange\u2019s lagging polls. Palin traveling to Alabama to campaign for Moore makes it even less likely that the president will travel to Alabama to campaign for Strange, as he is unlikely to try to face off against Palin on the ground. Strange has been desperate to get traction since he far underperformed expectations in the first round of the GOP primary, finishing in deep second place to Moore\u2014who far outperformed his polling back on Aug. 15. Trump only endorsed Strange in the first round of voting because he wanted to stop Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) from getting into the Senate, because Brooks said distasteful things about Trump during the 2016 GOP presidential primaries when Brooks was supporting Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). Strange\u2019s campaign has all but begged the president to come campaign for him in Alabama, but Trump has thus far refused to do anything for the appointed senator. Strange\u2019s campaign has been beset by the questionable way he was appointed into the U.S. Senate among many other setbacks. Strange was appointed by disgraced now former Gov. Robert Bentley after Sessions took over as Trump\u2019s Attorney General. Strange was at the time the attorney general of Alabama, and was investigating Bentley for the corruption and sex scandal for which he was forced to resign after appointing Strange into the Senate seat. Strange had asked the state legislature to hold off on impeachment proceedings of Bentley while his investigation proceeded. The close association Strange has with anti-Trump activists connected with Karl Rove\u2013as has been exposed in recent weeks\u2013has also led to Trump turning on Strange. Strange hired Rove\u2019s ex-chief of staff and the Senate Leadership Fund, an organization associated with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is run by Rove acolyte Steven Law. The organization has been caught deceptively editing videos to attack Republicans including Moore with false advertising.",

      "content": " \u201cPresident Trump told me he is still committed to the original MAGA [Make America Great Again] agenda,\u201d Gorka, a former deputy assistant to\u00a0President Donald Trump, who has since left the administration, told Breitbart News on Tuesday morning. \u201cWe are here to support him in a time when he is surrounded by people who had nothing to do with the success of November 8 and the true MAGA agenda.\u201d Gorka added that he plans to back all candidates who are just as anti-establishment as Donald Trump was last year. \u201cDonald Trump was the quintessential anti-establishment candidate,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cThe right- and left-wing elite are trying to undermine the people\u2019s choice for president. We will work with any American who has had enough of the Swamp\u2019s \u2018business as usual\u2019 attitude and their elitist policies.\u201d Gorka, Axios\u2019 Jonathan Swan, and Mike Allen reported on Tuesday morning, has joined a group called the MAGA Coalition. MAGA Coalition, along with Great America Alliance, is co-sponsoring Thursday evening\u2019s Palin-Gorka rally in Alabama. The new group MAGA Coalition will feature Gorka as \u201cchief strategist,\u201d which was the title that Stephen K. Bannon had when he was in the White House; Bannon is now back at Breitbart News and is also supportive of Moore\u2019s candidacy in Alabama. \u201cHe\u2019s co-headlining a rally with Sarah Palin in Montgomery, Alabama, Thursday night,\u201d Allen wrote. \u201cThe Palin-Gorka rally will promote Roy Moore, the controversial anti-establishment candidate running against incumbent Sen. Luther Strange.\u201d This is obviously significant because on Friday night President Trump is campaigning for Luther Strange, the establishment candidate whose incumbency in the Senate came under entirely questionable circumstances when he was appointed by now-former disgraced ex-Gov. Robert Bentley. Strange was the attorney general of Alabama and was investigating the governor for a corruption and sex scandal over which the governor eventually resigned. But first, the governor appointed Strange into the Senate seat vacated by now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions after Strange asked the Alabama legislature to hold off on impeachment proceedings and before the governor was eventually forced to resign. Notably,\u00a0the same Washington establishment forces that tried to stop Trump from getting elected last year are trying to help Strange defeat\u00a0Moore. \u201cA month ago, Gorka and Steve Bannon were working in President Trump\u2019s White House,\u201d Allen wrote in Axios. \u201cNow they are preparing to go head-to-head against the president to support an anti-establishment candidate who is loathed by the same establishment that originally loathed Trump.\u201d Details about the Gorka-Palin rally time and location are forthcoming, event organizers told Breitbart News. But Gorka\u2019s hitting the campaign trail is a huge development.",

Economic nationalists have been disheartened that Trump has caved on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for certain illegal immigrants, made deals with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), has had second thoughts about pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord, and is not prioritizing his signature campaign promise to build the wall. \u201cWe voted to put America first. Not the political elite that had ignored us for decades,\u201d Palin said. \u201cWe voted for a big beautiful wall, not for another amnesty deal.\u201d As has been noted, \u201cthe Washington Post reported that Moore has become a \u2018darling to Trump\u2019s base,\u2019 especially after, as U.S. News & World Report noted, \u2018[former White House Chief Strategist Steve] Bannon and his like-minded nationalists lieutenants at Breitbart have watched Trump\u2019s centrist turn with great unease.'\u201d Palin reminded voters that the \u201cMAGA\u201d movement started in Alabama in 2015 at a raucous rally when then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), who had been the intellectual leader of the economic nationalist movement in the Senate while Palin was the movement\u2019s heart and soul since the 2008 election, put on a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and said, \u201cthis isn\u2019t a campaign. It\u2019s a movement.\u201d Palin urged Alabamians to \u201csend a loud and clear message\u201d to the D.C. Swamp on Tuesday that \u201cour movement isn\u2019t over, and it\u2019s not slowing down. It\u2019s roaring and rumbling across the country.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re sending Trump someone who has our back \u2014 not Mitch McConnell\u2019s,\u201d Palin said. \u201cMake no mistake: Big Luther is Mitch McConnell\u2019s guy.\u201d",

The president decided to back Strange, with the support of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and much of the Republican establishment who believe that he can win, despite opposition from the very people who supported Trump for president. Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway assured Trump that he could help Strange succeed in battling back his primary challenger. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the hum of Air Force One touching down so that the president can lend direct and personal support to a candidate he\u2019s endorsed,\u201d Conway said, according to the Washington Post.

The poll was a telephone survey of 2,000 Republicans. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three percent. The debate is unlikely to have moved the needle toward Strange \u2014 where the candidate backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) spent much of the debate tirelessly repeating his endorsement from Trump. Moore meanwhile contrasted his own service to the state of Alabama with Strange\u2019s past as a lobbyist in D.C. Moore was also helped by the appearance\u00a0of grassroots heroes Sebastian Gorka and Sarah Palin, who both offered passionate support for the judge. Strange will be hoping for a significant boost when the president visits the state to campaign for him on Friday night. However, the FOX10 poll throws cold water on that hope, with 80 per cent of Republicans surveyed saying that the president\u2019s endorsement did not make a difference to their decision. FOX10 notes that 10 out of 10 recent independent polls of the race show Moore in the lead. The poll comes just days after it was reported that the Senate Leadership Fund, a PAC affiliated with McConnell, has dumped another nearly million dollars into Alabama to try to sway the race toward Strange Adam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

Trump\u2019s support for Strange, especially when one considers the agenda that got Trump elected in the first place, may cause people in Alabama to scratch their heads like they did when Alabama hired Mike Price to coach its football team last decade. And if Moore wins on Tuesday, Trump may get a rude awakening and realize that maybe it is not the best idea for the Democrats and globalists in his White House to block him from reading articles from conservative news outlets. Trump\u2019s rally was originally scheduled for Saturday, but it may have been moved up to Friday evening after his oh-so-savvy advisers may have finally realized that not even Trump would command the attention of Alabama voters on Saturday when they are thinking about what is going on in Vanderbilt and Missouri. Hours before the rally, Trump\u2019s Housing and Urban Development Secretary Dr. Ben Carson released a statement praising Judge Moore. \u201cJudge Moore is a fine man of proven character and integrity, who I have come to respect over the years. I was delighted to hear he is running for the US Senate. He is truly someone who reflects the Judeo-Christian values that were so important to the establishment of our country. It is these values that we must return to in order to make America great again. I wish him well and hope everyone will make sure they vote on Tuesday,\u201d Carson said.

And rightfully so.  9:19: Trump says \u201cimmigration security\u201d is a \u201cnational treasure\u201d and \u201cnational security.\u201d He 9:15: Trump says he has kept his promise to veterans. Talks missile defense in Hunstville.   9:10: Trump talks about renegotiating NAFTA. Would Strange support Trump on NAFTA renegotiations? 9:01: Trump again slams the Russia \u201choax.\u201d  8:57: Trump is astonished that Alabamians would love someone from New York. Has Trump never heard of lecli Gold? 8:56: Trump says the \u201celectoral college is a very special thing\u201d and he won because he decided to campaign in the states that you need to win. He then says that he had never been in favor of the electoral college but he is now in favor of it.  8:55: Again, when has Trump ever admitted that he\u00a0has\u00a0made a mistake? May tell you all you need to know about the state of play in the race. Remarkable.  8:52:  8:49: Trump: \u201cWe will always defend our borders.\u201d Trump says he feels like he\u2019s from Alabama. He says he understands and believes in \u201cAlabama values\u201d and \u201cthose are the values\u201d that made America great.   8:45: Trump blasts NFL players for disrespecting the flag. Crowd chants \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d He says excessive unnecessary roughness penalties are \u201cruining the game.\u201d He says what\u2019s hurting the game more is people taking a knee \u201cwhen we hear our great national anthem.\u201d He tells people to \u201cpick up and leave\u201d if they see players disrespecting the national anthem.    8:42: Trump, with a straight face, says Luther wants to \u201cend business as usual\u201d and is \u201cdetermined to drain the Swamp.\u201d Trump says he knows which Senators work hard and which ones don\u2019t. Trump claims Luther \u201cshares our agenda.\u201d 8:40: Trump talking extensively about the wall:    8:36: Trump talks about renegotiating NAFTA. Again, a bit weird since Strange lobbied for CAFTA. Trump says Strange is \u201ctough on borders\u201d and will be the \u201ctallest Senator.\u201d Trump says he has Chief of Staff John Kelly with him tonight. He joins him on stage. And just like that, Kelly gets off the stage as quickly as he can.   8:35:  8:34: Trump concedes \u201cI might have made a mistake\u201d in endorsing Strange. He says both Strange and Moore are \u201cgood men\u201d and he says he told Strange that if Moore wins, he will come to Alabama and \u201ccampaign like hell\u201d for Moore. Trump claims Roy Moore doesn\u2019t have a good chance to win in the general election in RED ALABAMA. Seriously?     8:33: Trump calling out the \u201cfake news media\u201d for going after Melania for wearing high heels while boarding Air Force One to go to Houston. 8:32: Trump says when Strange told him he had his total support on Obamacare repeal, it was the \u201ccoolest thing that has happened in months.\u201d He talks about \u201cBig Luther\u2019s\u201d height and says he is the tallest man he has seen and Strange should play for the Knicks. He slams McCain for his \u201cthumbs down\u201d vote. Trump claims that Strange doesn\u2019t know Mitch McConnell at all even though all of McConnell allies have been pouring millions into the race. Trump is explaining and explaining and explaining how he came to support Strange \u2026 when you\u2019re explaining\u2026  8:30: Trump calls out McCain for being a \u201cno\u201d vote on the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill:  8:20: Trump says Kim Jong-Un is watching every word Trump says like never before. Sounds like someone who could also be speaking for himself. Trump also says he loves Alabama and says had he lost the election he may have moved to Alabama or Kentucky. He touts Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. He slams Hillary Clinton and says had Hillary Clinton been elected \u201cyou\u2019d be turning over your rifles.\u201d The crowd loves the red meat but seems very lukewarm about Strange.       8:15: Trump talks about his address at the United Nations and says the world is starting to respect America again. Trump says America is going to win like \u201cyour football teams.\u201d Trump says he\u2019s not here \u201cfor global interests\u201d but the message seems a bit strange given that Sen. Strange lobbied for the Central American Free Trade Deal that cost Alabamians thousands of jobs.  8:10: Trump asks voters to send Strange permanently to the Senate to replace Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) even though Strange is opposed to Sessions\u2019s positions on issues like trade and illegal immigration.  8:00: \u201cLow Energy\u201d Luther talks about immigration reform and praises Trump\u2019s \u201cbuild the wall\u201d slogan. His heart doesn\u2019t seem into it. Strange says he has Trump\u2019s back and\u00a0that is why Trump is supporting him. Strange introduces Trump as his \u201cfriend\u201d as Trump comes on stage to \u201cSweet Home Alabama.\u201d   7:35 PM:\u00a0WHAT?? Breitbart News denied entry into Trump-Strange rally.  7:32:  https://twitter.com/MooreSenate/status/911365604728287233 7:30 PM: The Swamp really is scared and panicking:  7:15 PM:  https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/911326045160312832       https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/911328912113889282 7 PM: People attending the Trump rally are\u00a0going to vote for\u00a0Judge Roy Moore:  ",

      "content": " Reed, who is described by the Times\u2018 Jonathan Martin as \u201cworking with business leaders here to turn out votes for Mr. Strange,\u201d said that a victory for appointed incumbent Sen. Luther Strange\u00a0\u201cwould remind Bannon who\u2019s in charge, and I think give the president and the governing wing of the party momentum. He added:\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going all in to shut it down now.\u201d Bannon, who is backing Moore\u2019s insurgent campaign, is opposing his former boss, who is backing Strange. But the former CEO of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, and other Trump allies supporting Moore, say they are doing so to reinforce Trump\u2019s original governing agenda against the Republican establishment that is trying to frustrate it. Last week, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and former White House foreign policy adviser Sebastian Gorka both rallied for Moore, with Palin declaring: \u201cA vote for Judge Moore isn\u2019t a vote against the president.\u00a0It\u2019s a vote for the people\u2019s agenda that elected the president.\u201d Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson also backed Moore on Friday \u2014 an unusual move that theoretically pits a sitting Cabinet member against his\u00a0president. Members of the Republican establishment are hoping that Strange can pull off a victory, despite flagging poll numbers, to discourage \u00a0insurgent candidates in party primaries next year. \u201cIf Roy Moore wins, Bannon and all the other of those people will pop out of the woodwork everywhere,\u201d Sen.

The poll found that with registered voters, Moore leads 50 percent to Strange\u2019s 40 percent, with 10 percent of voters undecided. Among likely GOP voters, that lead shrinks slightly to nine percent.  Strange is likely to have been given something of a boost from President Trump\u2019s Friday night visit to Huntsville, where he backed Strange and urged Alabamians to support him. But while Trump has said he believed Strange could win the general election while Moore could not, he also said he would still campaign for Moore if he won. He also admitted he \u201cmight have made a mistake\u201d by wading into the race and backing Strange.

It will be the second television interview Bannon has given since leaving the White House. The first was just about two weeks ago with 60 Minutes. Reporting on Monday\u2019s rally, Axios quoted a source close to Bannon who said, \u201cSteve is coming to Alabama to support President Trump against the Washington establishment and Mitch McConnell.\u201d The source added that Bannon sees Moore as a \u201cfierce advocate of Trump\u201d and the values on which Trump campaigned. News broke on Sunday that Brexit leader Nigel Farage has also endorsed Moore and will speak at Monday\u2019s rally with Bannon for Moore. Farage told Breitbart London that his appearance at the rally is not to oppose Trump, but rather to secure victory against the political establishment and for the victories won in the 2016 election. He wants to help President Trump achieve his goals. Moore came in first in the primary election ahead of Luther Strange, leading to Tuesday\u2019s runoff election.

Sarah Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview here aboard the Great America Alliance bus that the movement that elected President Donald Trump is now firmly behind Judge Roy Moore here in Alabama.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " Palin\u2019s exclusive interview came on Thursday evening as she endorsed Judge Moore against establishment-backed Luther Strange in the GOP primary runoff for the U.S. Senate on Tuesday here in Alabama. She was speaking at a rally for Moore after the only debate between the two candidates, a Lincoln-Douglass style debate down the street here in Montgomery. The focus of the interview began by zoning in on the movement that now President Trump captured during the course of the 2016 presidential election, an election where Palin was one of his earliest and highest profile supporters. \u201cThis movement has been rumbling underground for so many years,\u201d Palin told Breitbart News. \u201cWe finally, during the last presidential election, had a spokesperson for what it was we had been saying and thinking and that was \u2018put America first.\u2019 Put America first. A lot of that movement, for Republicans, has to do with the battle against the Republican Party hierarchy that seems more concerns about party politics and positions\u2014their own titles\u2014versus what\u2019s best for their own constituents. I\u2019ve been fighting that since I was 18 years old and first registered to vote against the Republican Party in my own state, bless their hearts, running against them when they were not believing in smaller, smarter government and they weren\u2019t exercising Reaganomics. Running against them, winning, and it\u2019s helpful to see it wasn\u2019t just little old Wasilla, Alaska, that had those types of battles. Those battles have been going on all across this country, and finally enough people stood up and said \u2018enough is enough\u2019 and that\u2019s the movement. It\u2019s all good, it\u2019s all positive. It\u2019s all energetic.\u201d In the case of this race, Palin said it was an easy decision to endorse Moore over Strange. Strange has been caught up in a number of controversies as it has been discovered he lobbied for a firm that backed a controversial trade agreement that then shipped Alabama jobs to Central America, has an investment stake in a scandalous visa-for-sale firm that allows wealthy foreigners to buy their way into America, and has been backed by millions of dollars of dark money flowing into Alabama from establishment sources back in Washington, D.C. \u201cIt\u2019s a wee bit too simple, this one is,\u201d Palin told Breitbart News. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014ironically\u2014clear, cut, and dry. When people realize the background of one candidate, as opposed to the background of another candidate, it\u2019s just abundantly clear who it will be who will have the people\u2019s back, who will fulfill the promises, and put the people first.\u201d Palin, during her speech at the rally, noted that in 2016 all Americans defeated the swamp in Washington, D.C., by electing Trump president, but that the swamp is now trying to \u201chijack\u201d Trump\u2019s presidency. When asked to explain that remark, Palin reference remarks that then White House chief strategist now again Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon made at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) earlier this year when he noted that the political class was not just going to give up now that Trump won. \u201cIt\u2019s like Steve Bannon has said: Did anybody think they were going to give up power easily and gently? No. It\u2019s a battle,\u201d Palin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a battle for the future of this country. No, the swamp creatures don\u2019t want the swamp drained. That is what we voted for and our duly elected president is sent there to represent that way of thinking. So, no, they\u2019re not going to give up their power easily and gently and just go on their merry way.\u201d Palin added that she believes that Judge Moore is a \u201chappy warrior,\u201d a term that has been used to describe conservative luminaries like Andrew Breitbart and others who happily fight for the right thing simply because it is the right thing to do. With \u201chappy warriors\u201d like Moore in the U.S. Senate she added, America can win this war against the political class and corruption in the Washington swamp. \u201cWe can [win this war],\u201d Palin said. \u201cThis is what we need, the happy warriors who are in it for the right reason. They\u2019re in it for a reason, not just a season and not just a business for them. They have a servant\u2019s heart that we need in our government. So, yeah, we certainly can. I\u2019ve followed Judge Moore\u2019s career for many years, as I said, and the ups and downs and the battles that he\u2019s had inside and outside of the party and always standing up for what he believes is right. Some of the things he\u2019s done, I\u2019ve just gotten a kick out of, and I think they need some of that in Washington\u2014like when he showed up to vote riding a horse, I thought we\u2019d probably do the same thing. He\u2019s a good man and he\u2019s got great character. Yes, this is what we need. We don\u2019t need the lobbyist mentality in the Senate, because that lobbyist mentality has too often proven to the people that special interests that will enrich that lobbyist will come before the people\u2019s interest. We can\u2019t afford any more of that. That has led us to the $20 trillion debt that we\u2019re in. That has led us to the government growth and overreach that we see. So, no, we don\u2019t need to elect more of the problem\u2014we\u2019re not going to solve the problem by electing more of it.\u201d Palin concluded in her Breitbart News interview by noting that the good guys are all aligning behind Moore, a sign that the people will get a real champion if and when he gets to the U.S. Senate. \u201cJudge Moore, he\u2019s got the right people on his side, especially those who are in office now who have been bold enough to put their reputations on the line and come out and endorse and say \u2018yeah, we want to work with him back in D.C., because he\u2019s going to be on the people\u2019s side and he\u2019ll have the people\u2019s back,\u2019\u201d Palin said. \u201cThat\u2019s impressive, is the people who he has attracted to his campaign. More power to them.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Respondents in a last-days Alabama poll released on Monday were overwhelmingly resolved in their decisions to choose Judge Roy Moore over political appointee Luther Strange for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions earlier this year.",
      "author": "Michelle Moons",
      "content": " In the race being widely viewed as a referendum on the Washington, D.C. establishment, Moore has continued to lead despite establishment GOP forces dumping millions upon millions of donor dollars into the race for Strange. This new Cygnal/L2 poll was conducted on Saturday and Sunday, just hours after President Donald Trump held a Friday night rally for Strange in the state. Moore garnered 52 percent support in the poll of 996 Republican runoff voters,\u00a0according to AL.com. Strange lagged double digits behind with just 41 percent. Even with the poll\u2019s 3.1 percent margin of error, Moore comes out comfortably ahead of Strange. Last Thursday night, former Alaska Governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin rallied for Moore. She was joined by former deputy assistant to the President Sebastian Gorka and Rep. Louie Gohmert. Palin clearly conveyed that the race is a battle between the D.C. swamp, that wants Strange, and the candidate she\u2019s backing, Moore. She urged voters to \u201csend\u00a0the loudest message you can send to D.C. at this time.\u201d Trump Administration HUD Secretary Ben Carson has also backed Moore. He is one of 25 key conservatives to endorse Judge Moore in the race. Breitbart News Executive Chairman and former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, Brexit leader Nigel Farage ,and Duck Dynasty\u2019s Phil Robertson will hold a campaign rally for Judge Moore at Oak Hollow Farm in Fairhope, Alabama at 7:00 p.m. central time. Vice President Mike Pence will also hold a campaign rally in Alabama on Monday night, but for Strange. Trump backed Strange ahead of the August primary election in which Moore came in first and Strange second to move onto Tuesday\u2019s runoff election. Strange was appointed to Sessions\u2019 Senate seat by now ousted Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, who told reporters that when he spoke to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about whom to appoint, Strange was the first name that crossed McConnell\u2019s lips. A number of Alabamans have expressed concern about the questionable nature of the Strange appointment. Strange asked the Alabama legislature to halt investigation into then-Gov. Bentley ahead of Strange\u2019s appointment to the Senate. The McConnell-tied Senate Leadership fund has thrown copious millions behind Strange who has continually trailed in the polls. Cygnal VP of research & analytics Matt Hubbard pointed out in a memo on the new poll that Strange isn\u2019t leading in even one demographic group, according to AL.com. The poll was entitled, \u201cA near certainty Moore wins tomorrow.\u201d Palin has urged Alabamans to get out and vote for Moore. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News the night of the Thursday evening rally for Moore, Palin said that the movement that elected Donald Trump in 2016 is behind Judge Moore in Alabama. During Trump\u2019s Friday night rally for Strange he stated that he \u201cmight have made a mistake\u201d in endorsing Strange and pledged that if Moore wins, \u201cI\u2019m going to be here campaigning like hell for him.\u201d Trump reaffirmed this pledge during a Monday interview on the Rick and Bubba radio show. On Monday\u2019s edition of the Breitbart News Daily radio program, Bannon told listeners that the race is a \u201cnational race with global implications.\u201d He stated that it represents \u201ccorporate money versus grassroots muscle.\u201d Bannon had described the mountain\u00a0of D.C. establishment money behind Strange: \u201cIf you add up the first round and the second round, over $30 million of corporate money \u2013 this corporatist donor, consultant, lobbyist, politician cabal, this cartel that runs Washington, D.C. They\u2019ve taken over $30 million, and what have they done? This hasn\u2019t been a policy discussion down here, Raheem. It\u2019s the politics of personal destruction. It\u2019s what Andrew Breitbart absolutely hated.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s going to come down to turnout, and it\u2019s going to come down to people being motivated,\u201d Bannon told the Breitbart News radio listeners on the morning before Tuesday\u2019s runoff election.

      "author": "Tony Lee",
      "content": " But on Tuesday in the Alabama Republican runoff for the Senate seat that Sessions once held, the D.C. Swamp and all of the establishment-aligned entities that opposed Sessions are attempting to install the Swamp\u2019s senator (Luther Strange) who will put the Swamp\u2019s more corporatist\u00a0interests first. While former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was the heart and soul of the economic nationalist movement outside the halls of power after the 2008 election, Sessions emerged as the movement\u2019s intellectual godfather in Congress. Had it not been for Sessions\u2019 relentless and tireless defense of American workers on immigration and trade, Trump may have never won the GOP nomination and the presidency. But on these two vital issues that former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon said were two sides of the same coin that have decimated American workers, Strange has not been on Sessions\u2019 side. Strange has dodged questions about whether he would support the DREAM Act to give amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. And Strange lobbied for the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) that sent thousands of jobs from Alabama to countries like Honduras, as Breitbart News has extensively reported. The biggest tell, though, that Strange is diametrically opposed to the economic nationalist agenda that Sessions championed is that nearly every establishment-aligned group that viewed Sessions with nothing but scorn has gone all-in for Strange. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) reportedly begged Trump to campaign for Strange because they were so terrified that a Moore victory would inspire other grassroots challengers to, in Palin\u2019s words, primary \u201ctheir own Swamp creatures.\u201d And an outside group aligned with McConnell that supports establishment candidates has reportedly spent at least $10 million for Strange. Karl Rove\u2019s top establishment ally Steven Law told the New York Times about the vital importance of this race for their interests, saying the establishment is hoping that a Strange win could enable Trump to shield other establishment Swamp creatures from primary challenges. The Chamber of Commerce, which wants amnesty legislation and more trade deals that harm American workers,\u00a0has also gone all-in for Strange. Chamber of Commerce strategist Scott Reed told the Times that if Strange wins,\u00a0\u201cit would remind [former White House Chief Strategist Steve] Bannon who\u2019s in charge, and I think give the president and the governing wing of the party momentum.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going all in to shut it down now,\u201d he said. Sessions opposed the Chamber of Commerce\u2019s coveted Gang of Eight\u2019s comprehensive amnesty bill that would have devastated American workers for generations with all of his might. He issued a series of \u201ccritical alerts.\u201d He informed House Republicans about the ways in which the amnesty bill would erode the rule of law and harm American workers and ultimately strategized with them to prevent the bill from passing Congress. And when former President Barack Obama was working to implement his executive amnesty program, Sessions told the American people that he was hearing their voices on immigration and the importance of putting American workers first: I also have a message for the American people: you have been right from the beginning. You have justly demanded that our borders be controlled, our laws enforced, and that, at long last, immigration policy serve the needs of our own people first. For this virtuous demand, you have been demeaned, even scorned by the governing class. They know so much, this cosmopolitan elite. They want you to believe your concerns are somehow illegitimate. That you are wrong for being worried about your jobs, or your schools, or your hospitals, or your communities, or your national security. These elite citizens of the world speak often of their concern for people living in poverty overseas, yet turn a blind eye to the poverty and suffering in their own country. They don\u2019t want you to speak up. They don\u2019t want you to be heard. They don\u2019t want you to feel you have a voice. But you do have a voice. And your message is being heard. And I am delivering that message to the Senate today. Sessions also heard the voices of American workers on trade, and he led the charge against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal and, in doing so, made many Americans\u2014and legislators\u2014rethink the merits of unchecked free trade and globalization and how various deals impacted American workers at home. Trump may not have won the presidency had it not been for the importance of the trade issue\u2014and Hillary Clinton\u2019s waffling on the TPP agreement that she had once called the \u201cgold standard\u201d\u2014in the Rust Belt states. And it was because of Sessions that trade became such an important issue during the 2016 campaign. When Sessions became the firs sitting Senator\u00a0to endorse Trump, he also convinced many conservative who were on the fence about Trump to go to his side just like many black voters firmly went to former President Barack Obama when Obama won the Iowa caucuses in 2008. The D.C. establishment and the interests that line their pockets know very well how powerful Sessions\u2019 economic nationalist agenda is, and that is why they are pushing so hard to install someone like Strange who does not believe in it. Palin said the D.C. establishment is \u201cafraid\u201d because grassroots conservative candidate Judge Roy Moore is \u201ca threat to their power \u2014 because he is on our side, not theirs.\u201d \u201cThey know he\u2019s not one of them. And they know they can\u2019t control him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re sending Trump someone we know will have our back, not Mitch McConnell\u2019s.\u201d Palin told the audience that Judge Moore \u201canswers to you \u2014 just as your good Senator Jeff Sessions answered only to you.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Judge Roy Moore addressed a room of jubilant supporters in Montgomery, Alabama, with words of thanks and acknowledgment of God in his win shortly after he was declared by several media outlets to be the winner in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary runoff election.",
      "author": "Michelle Moons",
      "content": " Moore brought several people onstage to thank them for their part in the election. He also thanked his many supporters for the part they played in helping him achieve victory on Tuesday. He said that God has done more for his campaign than anybody and how, when he talks about God, he never prayed that he would win, but rather that God\u2019s will be done. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing too great for God,\u201d said Moore. \u201cWe are put on earth for a short time and for that time our duty is to serve almighty God and to acknowledge Him in all things,\u201d said Moore. Moore said that he had talked with the governor, his opponent Luther Strange, and Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Mike Lee (R-UT), among others. Moore continued: Together we can make America great! We can support the President. Don\u2019t let anybody in the press think that because he supported my opponent that I do not support him and support his agenda. As long as it\u2019s constitutional, as long as it advance our society, our culture, our country, I will be supportive. As long as it\u2019s constitutional. But we have to return to knowledge of God and the Constitution of the United States to the United States Congress. I believe we can make America great, but we must make America good, and you cannot make America good without acknowledging the sovereign source of that goodness, the sovereign source of our law, liberty, and government, which is Almighty God. We have become a nation that has distanced ourselves from the very foundation. Washington said that of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. Moore went on to address the divisions in the country, saying, \u201cWe are one nation under God and we can become one nation unified.\u201d He spoke of protests, demonstrations, mobs, and racial strife, but that \u201cwe\u2019re all made in the image of God.\u201d Moore remarked that the Constitution has been his life. He recalled his time being sworn into the U.S. military academy, serving in war, and fighting in the courts against liberal judges. He told the crowd he will fight for them in the United States Senate. \u201cThis is a time for victory. It\u2019s a time to remember the struggles we\u2019ve gone through, but it\u2019s also time to rededicate our lives to God and to the Constitution, and to our country, to our families. Let\u2019s go again and make America great,\u201d Moore said in closing with thanks again to the crowd and blessings. Breitbart News Executive Chairman and former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon addressed the crowd ahead of Moore declaring that the race was outrageous with $30 million spent against about $2.5 million. He also mentioned the news that broke earlier in the day that Strange-backer Sen. Bob Corker will not run for re-election in 2018. Bannon continued, \u201cThe question was called today in the state of Alabama, who\u2019s sovereign? The people or the money? And Alabama answered today, the people.\u201d Moore faced off against political appointee Luther Strange in Tuesday\u2019s runoff election after an August Republican primary election. Rep. Mo Brooks didn\u2019t make the top two and thus didn\u2019t move on to the runoff. Moore came in first and Strange in second to move on to the runoff election. The Mitch McConnell-linked Senate Leadership Fund poured millions upon millions of dollars into the race to support Strange and oppose Moore. The Senate Leadership Fund conceded defeat in the race little more than an hour after polls closed:  President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence each made trips to hold campaign rallies for Strange in Alabama in the final\u00a0days before election day. During Trump\u2019s rally for Strange, he told the crowd that he \u201cmight have made a mistake\u201d in endorsing Strange and would campaign \u201clike hell\u201d for Moore if he ran. Former Alaska Governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, former deputy assistant to the president Sebastian Gorka, Brexit leader Nigel Farage, and Duck Dynasty\u2019s Phil Robertson each came to Alabama to participate in campaign rallies for Moore in the final week of the campaign. The New York Times, AP, CNN and Fox News each called the race less than two hours after polls closed.  Strange issued a statement in response to the results shortly before addressing his supporters at an election night event.  Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana",

      "author": "Ian Mason",
      "content": " Palin, who had endorsed Moore in his populist-nationalist struggle against the establishment pick Luther Strange, took to Facebook to give her take on the landmark campaign with national implications for the future of the Republican Party. \u201cWe can win this war!\u201d Palin wrote. \u201cThis is what we need, the happy warriors who are in it for the right reason. They\u2019re in it for a reason, not just a season and not just a business for them. They have a servant\u2019s heart that we need in our government.\u201d She went on to expound on the significance of Moore\u2019s victory and his qualifications to take the seat that, until recently, belonged to now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, writing: I\u2019ve followed Judge Moore\u2019s career for many years, as I said, and the ups and downs and the battles that he\u2019s had inside and outside of the party and always standing up for what he believes is right. Some of the things he\u2019s done, I\u2019ve just gotten a kick out of, and I think they need some of that in Washington\u2014like when he showed up to vote riding a horse, I thought we\u2019d probably do the same thing. He\u2019s a good man and he\u2019s got great character. Yes, this is what we need. We don\u2019t need the lobbyist mentality in the Senate, because that lobbyist mentality has too often proven to the people that special interests that will enrich that lobbyist will come before the people\u2019s interest. We can\u2019t afford any more of that. That has led us to the $20 trillion debt that we\u2019re in. That has led us to the government growth and overreach that we see. So, no, we don\u2019t need to elect more of the problem\u2014we\u2019re not going to solve the problem by electing more of it. Before the election, Palin had emphasized that voting for Moore did not mean a vote against President Donald Trump and \u201cTrumpism,\u201d despite the president\u2019s backing of Strange. \u201cA vote for Judge Moore isn\u2019t a vote against the president,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a vote for the people\u2019s agenda that elected the president.\u201d Trump himself was quick to distance himself from Strange\u2019s defeat, deleting his tweets made in support of the appointed incumbent, and he called Judge Moore, the overwhelming favorite to be Alabama\u2019s next Senator, to congratulate him.",

      "subtitle": "As the establishment GOP reels from its seismic defeat in the Alabama Senate race on Tuesday, Breitbart News\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow is warning that the populist movement that helped Trump win in 2016 and worked to defeat Sen. Luther Strange (R-AL) in 2017 is \u201cinvigorated\u201d and ready for war in 2018.",
      "author": "Adam Shaw",
      "content": " \u201cI think a lot of people\u2019s greatest fears about this movement and how powerful it is were confirmed [Tuesday],\u201d Marlow told the Hill. Breitbart was widely seen as key in not only bringing greater national attention to the Alabama Senate race, but also in bursting the narrative that the establishment-backed Strange was an advocate for President Trump\u2019s agenda. Breitbart Executive Chairman and former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon was also a central figure in the race, campaigning for Moore with some fiery addresses at rallies. While Strange was a backer of Trump, and in turn got Trump\u2019s backing, Alabamians were turned off by Strange\u2019s history as a lobbyist, support of anti-American trade deals, and his unclear stance on DACA. Despite the full weight of the establishment, including outspending his opponent Judge Roy Moore 10-1, Strange was soundly beaten. But having helped win an important battle in the war to get a nationalist/populist agenda enacted, Marlow warns that Alabama was just part of a broader trend that bodes ill for the powers in D.C. \u201cWe see this race in Alabama as a confirmation of our values. We\u2019re in the early stages of a process in which we\u2019re seeing the Republican establishment lose influence and power despite their vast coffers of money. That\u2019s a trend that I think will continue. I think the establishment sees the writing on the wall.\u201d The Hill reports that Breitbart and Bannon will turn their attention to fights in a dozen states, while Bannon has met with a number of primary challengers to key establishment Republicans in places such as Nevada, Mississippi, and Arizona. It also reported that Bannon and his allies were seeing a primary challenger for Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) after he announced he would not seek re-election \u2014 something Marlow also sees as part of a trend. But it isn\u2019t just Republicans Breitbart and Bannon will be targeting, with Bannon meeting possible challengers in places such as Wisconsin, where Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is looking wobbly. The Hill described such intent as \u201cevidence of the scope of Breitbart\u2019s political ambitions.\u201d In addition to\u00a0Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, Brexit mastermind Nigel Farage, and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin are likely to feature prominently in nationalist-populist efforts to unseat establishment candidates as part of what is being termed a \u201cmedia-political nexus.\u201d Palin was one of the key figures in the 2010 Tea Party movement and is likely to be a rallying force in 2018 as well. \u201c[Palin] will be at the forefront in the coming war with the establishment for the heart and soul of the Republican Party,\u201d Andy Surabian, Bannon\u2019s political adviser in the White House, told The Hill. \u201cFew people have more sway with Republican voters than she does.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of synergy happening in the anti-establishment movement right now,\u201d Marlow agreed. \u201cPeople are in sync.\u201d Breitbart and other such forces are often described as \u201cpro-Trump,\u201d but as Marlow noted, the anti-establishment movement will back Trump only as long as he is\u00a0on the same page as his supporters. Trump\u2019s backing of Strange did little to prevent the populist right backing Moore, and he has seen criticism from his base when he has flip-flopped on areas such as the repeal of DACA. \u201cIt\u2019s about values and ideas,\u201d Marlow said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cult of personality.\u201d Marlow also responded to reports that White House chief of Staff John Kelly is preventing Trump from seeing Breitbart News coverage, calling such an action \u201cdetrimental to the president.\u201d \u201cThe biggest advantage the president has is that he has better political instincts than anyone in the country,\u201d Marlow said. \u201cIf he\u2019s not allowed to have full information, how is he supposed to be able to use those instincts and assess the information and come to these conclusions that he comes to where he\u2019s been vindicated time and again?\u201d Adam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

Moore prevailed with $1-2 million in support against the massive millions behind McConnell\u2019s candidate. Some estimate upwards of $30 million was spent in an attempt to defeat Moore.

While C.K. has not yet responded to the Times report, when confronted in the past with rumors of misconduct, he has denied all wrongdoing. C.K.\u2019s apparent desire to degrade women was also no surprise to those of us who remember his disgusting, misogynist tweets about former-Governor Sarah Palin. But that was in 2010 when the elite media was worried about Palin challenging Precious Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, so C.K. was either applauded for degrading a wife and mother in such a public way, or the media let it slide.

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " Following the not guilty verdict of seven-time felon and five-time deportee illegal alien\u00a0Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, who previously admitted to shooting and killing Steinle while she was walking on a pier with her father, Palin slammed San Francisco for its sanctuary city policies which allow illegal aliens to take safe haven in the region.  In an interview with a local news station in 2015, Lopez-Sanchez confessed that\u00a0he sought out San Francisco because it was a sanctuary city that would not deport him from the U.S. \u201cSanchez said he knew San Francisco was a sanctuary city where he would not be pursued by immigration officials,\u201d the local report added. Members of Congress like Rep. Lou Barletta (R-PA) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said they were distraught by the news that the illegal alien had been found not guilty of Steinle\u2019s murder, blaming sanctuary city laws that allowed Lopez-Sanchez to remain in the U.S.   While walking with her father on a pier in San Francisco in 2015, Steinle was shot by the illegal alien. Steinle pleaded with her father to not let her die, but she soon passed in her father\u2019s arms. The death of Steinle stirred a national immigration debate, with Americans becoming increasingly opposed a borderless southern border and cities like San Francisco, which give safe harbor to criminal illegal aliens.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " HuffPost observed: Couric called skating \u201can important mode of transportation\u201d in the city of Amsterdam. \u201cAs you all know,\u00a0it has lots of canals that can freeze in the winters,\u201d Couric said during the Opening Ceremony. \u201cSo, for as long as those canals have existed, the Dutch have skated on them to get from place to place, to race each other and also to have fun.\u201d While that might sound like a nifty explanation, it\u2019s not entirely accurate. Amsterdam has canals, which can freeze in winter. Certainly, some people enjoy skating on them\u00a0at those times. But the canals don\u2019t freeze all winter\u00a0and in plenty of years, they don\u2019t freeze at all. Couric was mocked mercilessly on Twitter:    It was only the latest geography error by NBC, which apologized Sunday for a remark by an analyst who credited Japan for South Korea\u2019s development. Japan occupied Korea, often brutally, from 1910 to 1945. Couric was lauded for her aggressive interviews of then-Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin in 2008, where she famously asked the Alaska governor whether she read newspapers, implying that she was ignorant. \u201cI was curious, what newspapers and magazines did you regularly read before you were tapped for this to stay informed and to understand the world?\u201d Couric asked. The question, which caught the governor\u00a0off-guard, was credited by many on the left for destroying Palin\u2019s image. Couric received awards and plaudits in the months to follow. Today, Amsterdam residents might well ask\u00a0Couric the same question she posed to Palin ten years ago. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " Incompetence at the FBI \u2014 not agitation against the Second Amendment \u2014 should be a national focus related to the mass shooting in Florida, said Palin. Adding to\u00a0that assertion, Palin stated, \u201cWhat needs to be discussed is the failure of the FBI. This kid who murdered all these innocent people could not have waved more red flags in front of law enforcement\u2019s face \u2013 all those things that he did with posts, with his threats. Law enforcement called 39 times in the last number of years at his family\u2019s home. There were so many red flags. I\u2019m embarrassed for the FBI. The rank and file guys and gals, they work so hard. It\u2019s the top brass. It\u2019s a matter of priorities in the FBI, and that\u2019s where I think the discussion needs to go.\u201d Since 2010, local law enforcement\u00a0had been called to the family home of shooter Nikolas Cruz, according to CNN: Broward sheriff\u2019s deputies were called to the Cruz family home 39 times since 2010, according to documents obtained by CNN. The sheriff\u2019s office received a range of emergency calls that included reports of a mentally ill person, child/elderly abuse, a domestic disturbance and a missing person. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Friday there were 20 calls for service over the past \u201cfew years\u201d pertaining to Nikolas Cruz. Cruz regularly expressed his interest in violence and mass murder, both online and in person. One acquaintance who knew Cruz from elementary school spoke with Miami\u2019s CBS affiliate: \u201cHe recalled Cruz stealing peoples\u2019 [sic] mail, throwing rocks at cars and tormenting animals. He described one incident in which he said Cruz \u201ccornered a squirrel and was trying to throw rocks at it and kill it.\u201d Cruz also regularly introduced himself to people as \u201ca school shooter.\u201d His online comments include,\u00a0\u201cI wanna shoot people with my AR-15\u201d and \u201cIm going to be a professional school shooter.\u201d Florida Gov. Rick Scott called on FBI Director Christopher Wray to resign for \u201cfailure to take action\u201d to prevent Cruz\u2019s mass murder, issuing\u00a0a\u00a0statement: The FBI\u2019s failure to take action against this killer is unacceptable. The FBI has admitted that they were contacted last month by a person who called to inform them of Cruz\u2019s \u201cdesire to kill people,\u201d and \u201cthe potential of him conducting a school shooting.\u201d Seventeen innocent people are dead and acknowledging a mistake isn\u2019t going to cut it. An apology will never bring these 17 Floridians back to life or comfort the families who are in pain. The families will spend a lifetime wondering how this could happen, and an apology will never give them the answers they desperately need. We constantly promote \u201csee something, say something,\u201d and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. \u201cSee something, say something\u201d is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI director needs to resign. \u201cThis is such a failure. There are\u00a017 people dead, and it could have been prevented,\u201d said Mansour.

      "subtitle": "The late Andrew Breitbart helped\u00a0Sarah Palin defend herself when Fox News Channel\u2019s former\u00a0Chairman Roger Ailes denied\u00a0her the opportunity to\u00a0respond\u00a0on air\u00a0to the\u00a0media\u2019s false accusations framing her for inciting the attempted assassination\u00a0of former Congresswoman Gabrielle \u201cGabby\u201d Giffords (D-AZ) in the days immediately following the 2011 Tucson mass shooting incident.",
      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Breitbart, so much of our commonsense defense wouldn\u2019t have gotten out there, because I was working for Fox News at the time, and I was not allowed to go on the air to defend myself for days,\u201d Palin said, speaking publicly about this for the first time, during a Friday interview on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight with Breitbart\u2019s Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour. The media firestorm surrounding the 2011 Giffords shooting actually began during the 2010 midterm elections, when Democrats accused Palin of inciting violence\u00a0because her political action committee (PAC), SarahPAC, circulated a map with crosshairs over congressional districts that the\u00a0Republican Party\u00a0hoped to win\u00a0that year. Palin\u2019s graphic highlighted 20 specific swing districts\u00a0that she\u00a0and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)\u00a0carried in the 2008 presidential race but were represented by a Democrat in Congress. With Palin\u2019s help, Republican candidates successfully won 19 of those 20 districts in the 2010 midterms. The one seat that did not swing to Republicans was held by\u00a0Gabby Giffords, who was shot on January 8, 2011, a few months after winning her re-election bid, when a mentally ill gunman, Jared Loughner, opened fire at a Tucson, Arizona, constituent gathering, wounding Giffords and killing six others. Democrats and their establishment\u00a0media allies cast blame on Palin for the mass shooting. However, as Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak reported, the public eventually learned that Giffords\u2019 shooter \u201cwas mentally disturbed and had no political motivations,\u201d and Palin\u2019s map graphic \u201cwas virtually identical to those used by Democrats for years, depicting targets atop contested congressional districts.\u201d \u201cThere is\u00a0no evidence whatsoever\u00a0of political incitement in the Giffords case,\u201d concluded Pollak. Fox News\u2019s\u00a0management denied Palin\u2019s requests to defend herself on the cable\u00a0network\u00a0against the aforementioned slander. And Palin, a Fox News contributor at the time, was also prevented by her strictly enforced employment contract from doing any rival media appearances without prior authorization from Fox management. \u201cI think that that time was our toughest time in this last decade of being out there on a public platform, [with] false accusations that we were to blame for the Gabby Giffords shooting,\u201d said Palin. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Breitbart, so much of our commonsense defense wouldn\u2019t have gotten out there, because I was working for Fox News at the time, and I was not allowed to go on the air to defend myself for days, and finally I bucked management of Fox News\u2014I never even talked about this publicly\u2014I bucked management and said, \u2018I\u2019ll do my own video, and I\u2019ll post it, and I\u2019ll explain to people that, no, we are not to blame.\u2019 My relationship with Fox was never the same after that.\u201d Palin noted Ailes\u2019 repeated refusal to allow\u00a0her a platform to defend herself from a barrage of media attacks falsely accusing her of inciting mass murder. \u201cI had asked [Roger Ailes], \u2018How many days do we have to go listening to this with no defense articulated at all? May I please go on the air?\u2019 And he wouldn\u2019t let me,\u201d said Palin. \u201cSo that was a tough time.\u201d Mansour, who worked as a senior aide and speechwriter for Palin at the time, reflected on how Democrats and their news media allies sought to lay blame for the mass murder and attempted assassination of Giffords at the feet of Palin and her staff. \u201cThat whole Gabby Giffords thing,\u201d said Mansour. \u201cIt was one of the worst moments, and we felt like we were besieged by people accusing us falsely, and your heart was just broken, too, because you\u2019re a mom, and you\u2019re watching the people suffering. I know this hits you really hard at home, because you have a big heart. What was interesting, when you look back, is that you have had instances like this again and again with the media, with a vicious media that just targets you and your family and just goes after you for these things.\u201d \u201cAnd I look at President Trump, right now, and the stuff that he faces\u2014and believe me, it\u2019s just awful, the fake news crap\u2014but\u00a0here is my take,\u201d Mansour continued. \u201c[Trump] always had connections with other media figures, he had a lot of money, and an organization defending him. But when you came on the scene, you were just an ordinary American, your family was very middle-class, just ordinary folks, you had risen up from the grassroots as a corruption-buster who was elected governor of Alaska, and you did not have a giant megaphone of people in the establishment media back east [defending you]. So when these people just came at you, it was really very scary, it was like being surrounded. Till this day, I still hear people repeat lies about you, and I\u2019m like, \u2018You have no idea that that\u2019s completely bogus.\u2019 How do feel about this now and what were the lessons learned?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t live by the praise of man so I know I\u2019m not going to die by their criticisms,\u201d said Palin. \u201cSo whatever they say, I don\u2019t care what the critics say.\u201d Palin described the period as trying for her and her family, noting that the intensity and hostility of biased media attacks\u00a0take a toll on even the strongest family. \u201c[I wish] people understood what it does to a family, how it potentially could rip apart a family because everybody has a different idea of how to react to the circumstances around you, and that causes some stress,\u201d said Palin. \u201cI thank God every day that I have a strong family, and we\u2019re doing great. Hopefully our story could inspire people to know that whatever they\u2019re facing, the sun will come out tomorrow and things can get better. It\u2019s just a matter of how you react to sometimes horrible circumstances around you.\u201d \u201cStill to this day, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0has still alluded to\u00a0[the Giffords shoot] and placed blame,\u201d Palin noted, alluding to a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0op-ed in June of 2017 that again blamed Palin for the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona.\u00a0Palin then\u00a0filed a defamation lawsuit against the Times for\u00a0falsely accusing her of inciting Loughner to shoot Giffords. Mansour recounted how she met Andrew Breitbart and a person the Breitbart News founder described as \u201cone of his really smart friends\u201d for the first time in 2011 when they offered to help Palin and her team. \u201cThat was the first time I met Andrew Breitbart,\u201d said Mansour. \u201cIt was during that time. It was a very troubled time. Our PAC was being falsely implicated in something that had absolutely nothing to do with us \u2026 and it was Andrew Breitbart who offered to help us. He basically came to me and said, \u2018Hey, how can I help? And I want to introduce you to one of my really smart friends who\u2019s going to help you, too, and by the way, his name is Joel Pollak.\u2019 And that was how I first met Joel Pollak.\u201d Seven years later, Pollak would become Mansour\u2019s co-host on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight.

      "author": "Kevin Scholla",
      "content": " This one however, is a bit different. While NASCAR drivers did have to deal with a bit of wind in Florida, those racing from Big Lake to Nome to Fairbanks will face not only wind, but very likely blizzards, pitch blackness, frozen rivers, and wild animals. This, ladies and gentleman is the annual Iron Dog. The Iron Dog is a grueling snow-machine race that has been stealing the show in Alaska since 1984. Todd Palin, former First Gentleman of Alaska is competing in the race for a 25th time. The event is rough on man and machine. The fact that Palin has won the race on four occasions is impressive. \u201cYou have to expect everything and anything,\u201d Palin told Breitbart Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s brutal.\u201d The toughest terrain in the state can be found along the Iron Dog route. Racers need to take care of themselves while also keeping their pricey snow-machines in shape. Many of the teams that start the big race fail to finish. Temperatures that can range from 40 above to well below zero can take a toll. The most common issue is suspension problems. Extreme cold makes everything brittle. Combine that with excessive abuse and the additional weight from gear, and parts begin to fail. Some will run out of fuel. Racers encounter diverse geography and varying weather conditions. While the Iron Dog and snow go hand-in-hand, there are large open plains with little or no snow. There\u2019s one stretch where the trees are so close that a racer might only be able to see about ten feet ahead. Elsewhere, ice slides must be climbed. Strong side hilling skills are required to get through this big dog. The 2018 edition of the Iron Dog is underway with just under 30 teams participating. Each team consists of two racers. Palin is teaming once again with Iron Dog vet Shane Barber. To become a veteran of this race you must complete the full course. A racer is considered a rookie until reaching the finish line. Team #11 (Palin-Barber) began their latest quest for the title Sunday, embarking on a monster ride of twists, turns, and treachery that spans 2,031 miles. Palin\u2019s wife, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was there to see Team #11 start their journey. Some of the Palin kids were on hand as well. The family has been known to enthusiastically support Todd Palin at the start, and at the finish line each and every year. Todd Palin\u2019s continued participation in this iconic race is something that was put in major jeopardy in 2016. Palin suffered severe injuries in a serious snowmachine crash in March of that year. Amazingly, he recovered enough to get right back on his snowmachine for last year\u2019s race and now again in 2018. To reach that finish line, teams will have to tackle weather conditions and repair shocks and engines. It\u2019s a new adventure from checkpoint to checkpoint. But, Palin\u2019s been here before. He knows what it takes to not only finish, but to win this lengthy contest. So how do you tame this dog? \u201cYou just have to have a clean run and you have to be steady,\u201d Palin said. \u201cEverything has to click.\u201d They\u2019re off! It will surely be a wild week. The world\u2019s longest, toughest race wraps up in Fairbanks on February 24th. We\u2019ll find out then what team was able to click this time around. ____ Follow Kevin Scholla on Twitter @kevinscholla",

      "author": "Breitbart News",
      "content": " Palin writes: Rev. Billy Graham was unlike other spiritual leaders in that God\u2019s favor seemed to envelope him like no other. He was able to get the message of truth to untold millions of people, bypassing politics, denominational divisions, and modern cultural criticism. That made him more effective than any modern-day leader. My mom watched his revivals on TV in the 70s during what some call \u201cThe Jesus Movement\u201d and gave her life to Christ after hearing the message of true salvation. Mom led the rest of the family to Christ as a result. Billy Graham profoundly changed me, my entire family, and millions of people needing hope and salvation around the world. In 2013, Palin spoke at\u00a0Rev. Graham\u2019s 95th birthday celebration, where she was introduced by\u00a0his son, Rev. Franklin Graham.  In his book Our Sarah: Made in Alaska, Palin\u2019s father, Chuck Heath Sr.,\u00a0writes about the time that he; Sarah; and his wife, Sally, were guests of Rev. Graham at his home in North Carolina, describing it as \u201cone of the highlights of our lives.\u201d Heath writes: Sally and I had attended a Billy Graham evangelistic crusade when he came to Alaska in the 1970s, but we never imagined we\u2019d actually get to meet him, much less visit him in his home. Later, Sally told me that while we were talking, she kept thinking of how her parents would have enjoyed being there with him. Although they were a dedicated Catholic family, Clem and Helen watched every broadcast of Billy Graham\u2019s crusades. Clem particularly enjoyed the music of George Beverly Shea. All I could think of was how glad I was that Sally was there. She had been enamored of Billy Graham\u2019s preaching all her life. At the time we met with him, Dr. Graham was ninety-one years old. He may have slowed physically, but he was still sharp and alert. We sat with him around the fireplace in a lively and engaging conversation that seemed to last just a few minutes. Actually, we talked for two hours.  From left to right: Gov. Sarah Palin, Chuck Heath Sr., Rev. Billy Graham, and Sally Heath during a visit Gov. Palin and her parents made to Rev.

      "author": "Ian Mason",
      "content": " NBC News cites five anonymous sources familiar with the plan, but the White House quickly threw cold water on the report. \u201cWe frequently face rumor and innuendo about senior administration officials. There are no personnel announcements at this time,\u201d Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said in a statement. Michael Anton, a National Security Council spokesman, went further, issuing an emphatic denial. \u201cI was just with President Trump and H.R. McMaster in the Oval Office. President Trump said that the NBC News story is \u2018fake news,\u2019 and told McMaster that he is doing a great job,\u201d he said in a statement. The immediate motive for Mattis and Kelly\u2019s plan is not clear from the NBC report, but McMaster\u2019s tenure as national security advisor has been, at times, strained. He was appointed to the post only after President Trump\u2019s first pick for the position, Gen. Micheal Flynn, resigned amid revelations he lied to Vice President Pence over the nature of his transition period contacts with Russian officials. This summer, McMaster came under fire for his apparent protection of career staff from the Obama White House, instructing them to keep quiet about the fact they were \u201choldovers.\u201d Since then, he attracted the ire of the Right when he promised his Obama era predecessor Susan Rice she could keep her security clearance, was accused of insulting the president\u2019s intelligence in the most unreserved terms, and showed a reluctance to refer to 9/11 as Islamic terrorism. The generally Trump-supporting Center for Security Studies (CSS), home to Breitbart News contributor Frank Gaffney, called for McMaster to be replaced in August, claiming he was \u201cundermining\u201d the president\u2019s foreign policy. CSS were soon joined in the call for McMaster to step aside by the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), who describe McMaster as \u201canti-Israel.\u201d In McMaster\u2019s corner stand Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), who have both sought to paint critics of McMaster as \u201calt right,\u201d \u201cwhite supremacists,\u201d and \u201cIslamophobes.\u201d NBC News suggests the man most likely to take up the national security advisor position after McMaster\u2019s departure is Ford Motor Company Vice President and George W. Bush National Security Council member Stephen Biegun. Biegun was the expert the John McCain campaign brought on board to bring running mate Gov. Sarah Palin up to speed on foreign policy. HBO\u2019s Game Change\u00a0fictionalized Biegun\u2019s involvement, suggesting Palin was so incompetent as to not know the antagonists of the two world wars. Biegun himself countered post-election criticism of Palin. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing,\u201d he told Politico. \u201cWe worked our asses off. It was a tough campaign. Then we have this? \u2026 I think she was fantastic. She just brought a special energy to our ticket. Look, I was there at those rallies.\u201d Condoleezza Rice, who was Biegun\u2019s boss in the Bush administration, called him \u201can outstanding person\u201d on MSNBC. \u201cHe\u2019s an expert in foreign policy and of course has spent time in the private sector and obviously he would be very, very good.\u201d",

      "content": " In a post on their Facebook page,\u00a0Diamond and Silk, an internet commentating duo that became popular during the 2016 election for their vocal support of President Trump, stated that after much deliberation, Facebook has deemed their content and videos \u201cunsafe to the community.\u201d The post on the duo\u2019s page reads; \u201cDiamond And Silk have been corresponding since September 7, 2017, with Facebook (owned by Mark Zuckerberg), about their bias censorship and discrimination against D&S brand page.\u201d \u201cFinally after several emails, chats, phone calls, appeals, beating around the bush, lies, and giving us the run around, Facebook gave us another bogus reason why Millions of people who have liked and/or followed our page no longer receives notification and why our page, post and video reach was reduced by a very large percentage.\u201d \u201cHere is the reply from Facebook. Thu, Apr 5, 2018 at 3:40 PM: \u2018The Policy team has came to the conclusion that your content and your brand has been determined unsafe to the community.'\u201d \u201cYep, this was FB conclusion after 6 Months, 29 days, 5 hrs, 40 minutes and 43 seconds. Oh and guess what else Facebook said: \u201cThis decision is final and it is not appeal-able in any way.\u201d (Note: This is the exact wording that FB emailed to us.)\u201d Diamond and Silk then posed multiple questions to Facebook and specifically the company\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The questions are; 1. What is unsafe about two Blk-women supporting the\u00a0President Donald J. Trump?\n\n2. Our FB page has been created since December 2014, when exactly did the content and the brand become unsafe to the community?\n\n3. When you say \u201ccommunity\u201d are you referring to the Millions who liked and followed our page?\n\n4. What content on our page was in violation?\n\n5. If our content and brand was so unsafe to the community, why is the option for us to boost our content and spend money with FB to enhance our brand page still available? Maybe FB should give us a refund since FB censored our reach.\n\n6. Lastly, didn\u2019t FB violate their own policy when FB stopped sending notifications to the Millions of people who liked and followed our brand page? Breitbart News has reached out to Facebook for comment on the issue but has yet to receive a reply at the of the writing of this article. This isn\u2019t the first time that Diamond and Silk have faced internet censorship, the YouTube stars had their videos demonetized from YouTube\u2019s platform in August of 2017. The duo claimed that YouTube had \u201cstopped over 95% percent of our videos from being monetized, stating: \u2018It\u2019s Not Suitable For All Advertisers\u2019.\u201d The internet commentators implied that they may take legal action against YouTube at the time saying in a tweet; \u201cWe Smell A Class Action Lawsuit. This\u2026. S.ugar H.oney I.ce T.ea have got to stop. YouTube\u2026\u2026Google, this does not look good!\u201d  The two received support at the time from former Governor Sarah Palin;  Fox News commentator Sean Hannity also appeared to voice his support for Diamond and Silk in a tweet; How sad in America that only conservatives get investigated, fired, boycotted and attacked.

      "content": " Palin declared, \u201cThe reason that I did want to call was to thank Breitbart for covering so fully and so intelligently this whole Facebook stuff and to also explain it to people.\u201d Palin called out Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg this week for censoring pro-Trump YouTube stars Diamond and Silk and for\u00a0stifling conservative Facebook pages with\u00a0his new\u00a0algorithm. Palin, who in the past has successfully used her large Facebook platform to rally support for conservative candidates and causes, described Facebook as \u201ca liberal group of people who are trying to control and regulate and make sure that we the people don\u2019t get back in control of our government.\u201d Palin speculated that growing public awareness of Facebook\u2019s left-wing operations may energize conservatives. She stated, \u201cI think people are more and more fed up with that, and they\u2019re thankful to see proof of what they have felt is going on, and I think that creates a momentum on the commonsense conservative side of things, and that momentum can carry the 2018 election victories on our side. I feel that there are more of us than there are of them.\u201d LISTEN: Palin added, \u201cIt\u2019s going to come down to who wants it more. Who will be more motivated to get out there and have their voice heard via their vote? Do we the people want to get back in control of government or not? It\u2019s who wants it most.\u201d Palin deduced that many conservatives are less politically involved than their left-wing contemporaries. She remarked, \u201cOn our side, so many good and hard-working businessmen and women and parents and families are just doing their own thing \u2014 living, building a good life for themselves and their families. They\u2019re busy, and they\u2019re not obsessed with current events and politics as we are.\u201d Palin continued, \u201cA lot of people do not know what action they could or should take to make the difference. It\u2019s easy for me to say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to get out there and be an activist and make sure that you\u2019re helping our president, and get We the People back in control of our government.\u2019 But people don\u2019t know how to do it.\u201d Palin said she directs people to Breitbart News\u2019s content as a starting point for becoming more politically aware and involved. She added, \u201cWhat I do is try to turn people on to sites like Breitbart, people who are writing and publishing the truth so that people will get educated.\u201d Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday that his company deploys \u201cabsolutely no bias\u201d in its operations.

She said,\u00a0\u201cThis country is war weary and the folks like your family have borne the brunt and the weight of those wars and have come home and seen what happens to family members who just come home different. Our VA still isn\u2019t even fixed. How about if we make a rule? Until our VA is completely fixed for our vets, until that happens, we\u2019re not going into any more wars. We should make that the rule.\u201d LISTEN:  Palin concurred, noting the rate of daily suicides\u00a0by veterans, according to VA data. She stated, \u201cThat\u2019s brilliant. It\u2019s something that Todd talks about. He talks about this every day. There\u2019s still more than 22 vets a day who are killing themselves. More than 22 vets a day have given up hope in assimilating back into society and making it again. The battles that they fight once they\u2019re home are tremendous.\u201d Palin added, \u201cIt\u2019s the VA\u2019s job to figure this out and do something about it. It\u2019s still very broken. The system is broken and the transition from combat back into society, that system is broken, because the decision-makers have never gone through transition. They\u2019re lifers. They are career in bureaucracy, so they haven\u2019t lived it. It\u2019s those who have served and done their tie honorably who have come home who have the toughest time.\u201d While discussing the recent calls for increasing U.S. military operations in Syria, Palin spoke of the costs of war for military families. \u201cThere has to be avoidance of the short-sighted decision-making,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like that old saying, the old men call war and they send the young men to go fight them. No. I see what war does to an individual, to a family. I guess there\u2019s a lot of humanity that I\u2019m considering at this point.\u201d \u201cAmerica is the strongest fighting power on the globe, and we should be,\u201d Palin said. \u201cBut being the strongest should create an environment of peace. That\u2019s what Reagan used to preach.\u201d Palin has been a vocal advocate for veterans struggling with the transition into civilian life. She has spoken candidly about her family\u2019s personal experience with the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) of her eldest son, Track Palin, a U.S. army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Palin\u2019s son-in-law, Dakota Meyer, is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in both Afghanistan and Iraq and is a Medal of Honor recipient. President Donald Trump fired David Shukin from the VA\u2019s secretaryship in late March. A 2010 memorandum\u00a0from the Deputy Undersecretary for Health for Operations and Management revealed varying methods being used by VA hospitals to cover up long wait times, including: A 2017 report from the VA\u2019s inspector general\u00a0concluded that more than 100 veterans died while waiting for care at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (facility) hospital between October 2014 and August 2015.

So often you got to follow the money and that leads you to what the root is of some of these arguments.\u201d Palin called for an articulation of the American national interest in Syria prior to any military operations within the Levantine state: So those making this point that we need to insert our power and get in there and get rid of Assad, I\u2019m not comfortable with it and American citizens should not be comfortable with this until there is very focused articulated reasons provided to us and Congress \u2014 and Congress need to be a part of this, too, not just the administration \u2014 until we find out what the heck we would be doing there.\u00a0There has to be avoidance of the short-sighted decision-making.

      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " In a Thursday interview on Breitbart News Tonight with\u00a0SiriusXM hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak,\u00a0Palin cautioned that \u201cthis type of rationed healthcare controlled by government bureaucrats and politicians\u201d is \u201cthe road we\u2019re on\u201d if the United States continues down the path towards a totally government-controlled socialized healthcare\u00a0system. LISTEN:  Alfie Evans is a critically ill toddler who was recently removed from life support against the wishes of his parents by order of the British government, following a United Kingdom High Court decision on April 11. British authorities also\u00a0denied the parents\u2019 request to transfer their child to a Vatican-owned children\u2019s hospital for treatment at the invitation of Pope Francis and Vatican officials who offered to cover the child\u2019s healthcare and travel expenses. Palin said, \u201cThe hospital and quote-unquote \u2018health care providers\u2019 won\u2019t listen to the parents of Alfie, and of course the parents want to take all these offers from others to help their special needs child who will die under the care of this hospital that is adhering to the socialized rationed health care rules.\u201d Palin recalled her 2009 Facebook post in which she coined the term \u201cdeath panel\u201d to warn of the dangers of the Democrats\u2019 push for a government-controlled healthcare system. She wrote: The Democrats promise that a government health care system will reduce the cost of health care, but as the economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out, government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost. And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama\u2019s \u201cdeath panel\u201d so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their \u201clevel of productivity in society,\u201d whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil. Health care by definition involves life and death decisions. Human rights and human dignity must be at the center of any health care discussion. Palin reminded listeners that she had been \u201cmocked\u201d and \u201cjust about run out of town\u201d for warning about \u201cdeath panels\u201d during the months leading up to the passage of Obamacare. Left-wing PolitiFact described her \u201cdeath panels\u201d comment as its 2009 \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d\u00a0The comment inspired such heated debate that President Obama addressed her criticisms in a special joint session of Congress, where he said the idea \u201cthat we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens\u201d is a \u201ccynical and irresponsible\u201d lie. However, in the years following the passage of Obamacare, left-wing pundits\u00a0and Democrats\u00a0like Howard Dean\u00a0have openly admitted that Palin was correct\u00a0that the\u00a0denial of live-preserving treatment is inevitable within a system of rationed government-controlled health care. Palin recalled her warning of years ago, \u201cIf Obamacare were to include many of the aspects that it in fact did include, rationed health care would certainly be the result. Government would be in control. Obviously the care would have to be rationed. Obviously it would be faceless bureaucrats who have to make the rules of ultimately who lives and who dies, and we\u2019re seeing that play out in Alfie\u2019s case, and it\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking. I think it\u2019s diabolical. I think it\u2019s inhumane what is going on \u2026 especially [as] there are offers to help this special needs child. The hospital [and] the bureaucrats \u2026 won\u2019t allow the parents to take their precious child and get that care.\u201d Pollak asked Palin if events surrounding Alfie Evans are illustrative of the future of American health care if the U.S. continues to move towards a fully state-run healthcare system as Obamacare in its current form collapses. Palin replied, \u201cIt\u2019s our future coming down the pike if lackadaisical voters ignore the warnings of the death panels, and if they just assume that Obamacare is in place and it will forever be in place because the GOP \u2014 having promised to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something better \u2014 still haven\u2019t fulfilled their promise.\u201d Palin continued, \u201cThat\u2019s the road that we\u2019re on \u2026 and it is a scary thing. I want everybody to understand that this type of rationed healthcare, controlled by government bureaucrats and politicians, it affects every single person. If you are an adult and your parents are still alive, we\u2019re talking about the elderly being affected, so you have to personalize this and ask yourselves, \u2018Do I want government telling me that my parents\u2019 lives are no longer productive, so they\u2019re not worthy of the limited health care that government is going to be able to provide?\u2019\u201d Palin, whose youngest son has Down syndrome, is an outspoken advocate for the Special Needs community. She noted how Nazi Germany\u2019s eugenics program initially targeted the disabled for termination. \u201cHitler wanted to get rid of all the special needs children because they were not productive, in his view, and didn\u2019t meet society\u2019s standards of perfection, and he wanted some kind of perfect race,\u201d she said. She warned against empowering the state to \u201cmake decisions of who lives and who dies.\u201d Pollak concurred with Palin\u2019s analysis. \u201cWhat you say has so much significance,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just in Poland. We were on the March of the Living commemorating the Holocaust, and what you say is correct. Many of the early experiments with state-sanctioned murder under the Nazi regime were not in fact of Jewish people but were eugenicist policies being carried out to rid the population of people that the Nazi ideology suggests should not be allowed to survive and reproduce. \u2026 Once you start making those decisions it\u2019s a very slippery slope to just horrible, unbelievable, terrible things. That\u2019s why we have to take this so seriously.\u201d On Monday, the European Court of Human Rights rejected a case from Alfie Evans\u2019 parents\u00a0requesting the transfer of their toddler to the Vatican-run children\u2019s hospital for treatment instead of euthanasia in a British hospital. British authorities deployed law enforcement to guard the hospital where Alfie Evans is being held following a report of an alleged plan to storm the hospital by those opposed to the state\u2019s decision to euthanize the toddler.  Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) described the case of Alfie Evans as \u201ca grim reminder that systems of socialized medicine like the National Health Service (NHS) vest the state with power over human lives, transforming citizens into subjects.\u201d Italian Bishop Francesco Cavina described the British authorities\u2019 denial of Alfie Evans\u2019 parents\u2019 request to accept the Vatican\u2019s invitation to care for their baby as \u201coutside all human logic.\u201d The director of the Vatican-owned Bambino Ges\u00f9 children\u2019s hospital said UK authorities are carrying on an \u201cideological battle\u201d in their refusal to let Alfie Evans be treated elsewhere, adding that the decision betrays \u201chostility toward the Vatican hospital.\u201d Breitbart News Tonight\u00a0broadcasts live\u00a0Monday through Friday on SiriusXM\u2019s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).

In his upcoming book, Restless Wave, McCain reportedly recalls \u201cthat his advisers warned him that picking a vice-presidential candidate\u201d in Lieberman \u201cwho caucused with Democrats and supported abortion rights would divide Republicans and doom his chances.\u201d \u201cIt was sound advice that I could reason for myself,\u201d he reportedly writes. \u201cBut my gut told me to ignore it and I wish I had.\u201d Palin galvanized conservatives and working-class voters who were fed up with both political parties when she was put on the ticket, and she was the only reason McCain even had a fighting chance of defeating Barack Obama in 2008\u2014the McCain-Palin ticket took a two-point lead after the Republican National Convention. Voters ultimately vote for the top of the ticket, though, and McCain lost the election in large part because his incompetent and in-over-their-head advisers like Nicolle Wallace and Steve Schmidt decided to infamously go \u201call-in\u201d by suspending his campaign during the financial crisis. McCain\u2019s hacks, who allowed McCain to go to White House meetings about the financial crisis without being fully prepared or briefed about TARP (Trouble Asset Relief Program), somehow managed to make a freshman Senator seem more presidential than the distinguished war hero and veteran legislator. After the 2008 election, Palin gave a voice to blue-collar conservatives who were ignored by the GOP establishment that had nothing but disdain and contempt for them and the issues they cared about like illegal immigration. The former Alaska Governor also made it possible for an economic nationalist and outsider candidate like Donald Trump to eventually crush the Republican establishment in the 2016 primaries and then shock the elites in the bipartisan permanent political class in the general election. The Republican establishment, sensing the existential threat that Palin represented long before Trump\u2019s rise, promptly tried to to everything to undermine her influence, previewing what they would try to do to Trump eight years later. Last year, I highlighted nine prominent ways in which Palin was a trailblazer for Donald Trump\u2019s rise, and former President Barack Obama, whose head Palin lived in rent free for much of his time in the White House, also observed that there is a \u201cstraight line\u201d from Palin to Trump. \u201cI see a straight line from the announcement of Sarah Palin as the vice-presidential nominee to what we see today in Donald Trump, the emergence of the Freedom Caucus, the tea party, and the shift in the center of gravity for the Republican Party,\u201d Obama said.",

      "subtitle": "From the sound of it, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) is currently on his deathbed in Arizona to meet with old friends, nurse grudges, and express regrets. Along with his upcoming memoirs, the 81-year-old war hero, who is suffering from a deadly brain cancer, is so focused on shaping his legacy, he has apparently drawn up a list of potential candidates, including his wife, to replace him after his death.",
      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " Ultimately, this decision will be up to Arizona\u2019s Republican governor. McCain is now openly wishing he had not chosen Sarah Palin, who was then the sitting governor of Alaska, as his 2008 presidential running mate. Looking back on his ill-fated quest to defeat Barack Obama, McCain now says he should have chosen Joe Lieberman, a fellow senator. At the time Lieberman was officially an Independent, but that was only for political expediency. After losing the 2006 Connecticut Democrat primary, and in order to hold on to his seat, Lieberman ran in the general election as an Independent and won. But he was still a pro-abortion Democrat who caucused with Democrats, and who just six years earlier had been Al Gore\u2019s running mate. McCain\u2019s public expression of regret against Palin comes off as ungracious, as well as further proof that he still does not understand why his own presidential campaign failed. Over the last decade, Palin has been unfailingly loyal to McCain. Despite the malicious leaks against her that came from his own campaign surrogates, despite unrelenting personal attacks from McCain\u2019s own daughter Meghan, Palin has never spoken ill of the elder McCain. She has always and only expressed gratitude and respect, even as McCain\u2019s family and immediate subordinates (all of whom were seeking favor from the media hoping to be rewarded with careers) savaged her purely for mercenary purposes. Within this context, McCain kicking Palin from his deathbed, when he knows it would be impossible for her to defend herself, edges into an act of dishonorable cruelty on his part. What makes McCain\u2019s statement seem especially gratuitous is that is makes absolutely no sense. Polling proves beyond doubt that the only time the hapless McCain campaign came within striking distance of Obama was after Palin came onboard. Her outsider status, \u00a0populist bona fides, charisma, willingness to fight, and ability to capture the heart of a Republican base (that never embraced McCain), was the only chance the mercurial senator, who seemed to bask in the glow of media acclaim whenever he stabbed one of his own in the back, ever had. Choosing Lieberman, who had already lost as a Democrat in that same role six years earlier, would have been a disaster, just more proof that McCain\u2019s judgment was erratic, his \u201cmaverick\u201d status a narcissistic pose, his conservatism a joke. While Joe Lieberman seems like a decent man, at the time, McCain was a 72-year-old cancer survivor. Choosing a far-left Democrat as his successor would have been seen as a gimmick fueled by desperation and therefore just more proof that McCain lacked the prudence to sit in the big chair. Instead, after wisely choosing Palin, McCain and his campaign made two fatal errors. First, Palin was utterly mismanaged. Just for starters, before Trump successfully did the same, Palin wanted to launch an insurgency campaign into working class Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where her blue collar populism and legitimate reputation as an anti-establishment reformer could have made the difference. She was told no. Secondly, on September 24, less than two weeks before Election Day, McCain made the disastrous decision to suspend his presidential campaign. For reasons no one will ever understand, in the hopes of saving the economy, McCain jumped on a white horse when he had no idea which way to charge. He looked ridiculous and effectively handed the presidency to an inexperienced left-wing radical. Even if Lieberman could have talked McCain out of making what is almost certainly the biggest blunder in the history of presidential campaigns, Palin was still his only hope. McCain\u2019s Palin regret could have to do with something besides losing the presidency. Among America\u2019s establishment elitists, the Palin pick does damage his legacy. It pains me to think that anyone would care what that hideous group thinks, especially on a deathbed. Maybe it is bigger than that, though, maybe McCain understands that by launching Palin into a national figure, he effectively paved the way for a makeover of a Republican Party that was long overdue, a Party that in 2008 was too eager to go to war, too chummy with big business, and that made illegal aliens a priority over American citizens who followed the rules \u2014 most especially in the Rustbelt. Everything about Sarah Palin, her fearlessness, her governing record, her fight, her ideas, her refusal to conform in the face of unprecedented media hate and unrelenting backstabbing from McCain\u2019s inner-circle \u2014 all of these things helped to drop the scales from the eyes of voters, which in turn paved the way for a Donald Trump to, at long last, shift the GOP base away from war, corporations, and pandering to illegals. From the Tea Party to Trump, the GOP has not been the same since Palin strode into the spotlight, and now it is hardly recognizable from the calcified dinosaur McCain loved so. If that is what he regrets,\u00a0that is a real shame, because on top of his military career, choosing Sarah Palin was the greatest service McCain ever performed for his country.

In fact, McCain most likely would not even be in the Senate today had Palin, despite getting considerable heat from Tea Party conservatives, not endorsed and campaigned with McCain in 2010 when he was up for reelection and facing primary challengers from the right.",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " Pretending not to be one of them, documented-conspiracy theorist Sullivan writes, \u201cIn fact, in our current culture, it\u2019s precisely the elites who seem to be driving tribal identity and thought, and doubling down on ideological and affectional polarization.\u201d He closes with this shameless act of rose-colored hypocrisy: But then I remember a different time \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t so long ago. A friend reminded me of this\u00a0bloggy exchange\u00a0Ta-Nehisi and I had in 2009, on the very subject of identity politics and its claims. We clearly disagreed, deeply. But there was a civility about it, an actual generosity of spirit, that transcended the boundaries of race and background. \u2026 But a conversation in the same pages was still possible, writer to writer, human to human, as part of the same American idea\u2026 It\u2019s only a decade ago, but it feels like aeons now.\u00a0The Atlantic\u00a0was crammed with ideological opposites then, jostling together in the same office, and our engagement with each other and our readerships was a crackling and productive one. There was much more of that back then, before Twitter swallowed blogging, before identity politics became completely nonnegotiable, before we degenerated into these tribal swarms of snark and loathing. I think of it now as a distant island, appearing now and then, as the waves go up and down. The riptide of tribalism can capture us all in the end, until we drown in it. Ahhh, yes, 2009 at oh-so civil Andrew Sullivan\u2019s precious Atlantic\u2026 I remember it well. Let\u2019s start with the small stuff. Thanks to Instapundit\u2019s Ed Driscoll, I am reminded that in September of 2008, mere weeks before Election Day \u2014 \u00a0you know, just prior the 2009 launch of the Golden Age of Civility at the Atlantic, it was this very same Atlantic that sandbagged then-presidential candidate John McCain into posing for this harshly-lit cover photo. But that was not the worst of it. To snap this photo, the Atlantic hired far-left photographer Jill Greenberg who did this with the outtakes. But that was all child\u2019s play compared to the incurable cancer spread by Mr. Sullivan. As soon as then-Alaska Governor Sarah Palin strode onto the national stage as McCain\u2019s running mate, as soon as her dynamic and fearless presence gave the hapless McCain campaign what would be their only real shot at beating Barack Obama, using the pages of the Atlantic, and all in an effort to wield lies as a means to humiliate Palin, Sullivan did something no establishment journalist had, until then, done in my lifetime: launched an evidence-free campaign of personal destruction in the form of a conspiracy theory, and did so without facing a single consequence from his \u201cjournalist\u201d peers. It became known as Trig-Trutherism, and in his unrelenting jihad, Sullivan wrote countless articles at the Atlantic claiming Trig Palin was not Sarah Palin\u2019s child. Worse still, he claimed Trig\u2019s true birth mother was the governor\u2019s eldest daughter, Bristol, who at the time was a 17-year-old minor. Writing piece after piece after piece, beginning in the heart of the 2008 presidential campaign, and in a feverish act of breathtaking and carefully-plotted cruelty, Sullivan spent years spreading this lie all in the hopes of undermining a key part of Sarah Palin\u2019s identity \u2014 her motherhood. And the weapons Sullivan wielded against their own mother, were the teenaged Bristol and Trig, a Down Syndrome baby. Yes, conspiracy theories targeting presidential candidates are as old as presidential campaigns. In fact, at this same time, Obama was himself dealing with a conspiracy theory surrounding the origins of his birth. But what made Sullivan uniquely sinister, what made his conspiracy of cruelty a breech, not only with respect to political civility but in public trust of the mainstream media, is that despite his evidence-free attacks on Palin and her young children, he remained a member-in-good standing within the media establishment. Not only did Sullivan\u2019s malignancy slither its way into the rest of the media, most notably, it did so while this very same media was systematically destroying anyone who dared question Obama\u2019s origin of birth, which included making anyone who refused to condemn the Obama conspiracy socially unacceptable. Meanwhile, Sullivan was not only not expelled over his own birther conspiracy, he thrived. The fact that an establishment media figure was allowed and encouraged to spread his poison on no less than the pages of the Atlantic, the fact that his utterly insincere, partisan viciousness \u2014 the kind of demonic smear job that until then had only existed in sleazy whisper and dark-moneyed pamphlet campaigns \u2014 enjoyed the imprimatur of the mainstream media, was a thick-red-line in the history that ushered in this era Sullivan now describes as \u201ctribal swarms of snark and loathing.\u201d Andrew Sullivan can attempt to rewrite his own tribal and toxic history all he wants, but that he is a cruel, cold-blooded, and hateful word-sadist is his true legacy. Sullivan\u2019s sewer campaign and the political media that legitimized it \u2014 that was the Rubicon. And never forget that after his Trig-Trutherism had run its course, Sullivan launched an all-new evidence-free conspiracy with the claim that Pope Benedict is a practicing homosexual.

      "author": "Warner Todd Huston",
      "content": " Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen is preparing a new seven-episode series for the premium cabler called Who is America, where he reportedly dupes famous Americans such as former Vice President Dick Cheney. Palin was just one of those personalities and former government officials the comedian tricks into appearing on camera. On Tuesday, Matt Drudge Tweeted and deleted a post about Palin and other political figures on the right and left being tricked by the Cohen, specifically naming \u201cCheney, Palin, Howard Dean, Alberto Gonzales, Bernie, Trent Lott, Patraeus, Ted Koppel, and more.\u201d \u201cYup \u2013 we were duped. Ya\u2019 got me, Sacha. Feel better now?\u201d Palin said on Facebook. \u201cI join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick \u2018humor\u2019 of the British \u2018comedian\u2019 Sacha Baron Cohen, enabled and sponsored by CBS/Showtime,\u201d Palin added. But Palin went on to explain what she experienced under the guise of participating in what she thought was a \u201cdocumentary\u201d about American veterans. This \u201clegit opportunity\u201d to honor American Vets and contribute to a \u201clegit Showtime historical documentary\u201d was requested of me via a speakers bureau. For my interview, my daughter and I were asked to travel across the country where Cohen (I presume) had heavily disguised himself as a disabled US Veteran, fake wheelchair and all. Out of respect for what I was led to believe would be a thoughtful discussion with someone who had served in uniform, I sat through a long \u201cinterview\u201d full of Hollywoodism\u2019s disrespect and sarcasm \u2013 but finally had enough and literally, physically removed my mic and walked out, much to Cohen\u2019s chagrin. The disrespect of our US military and middle-class Americans via Cohen\u2019s foreign commentaries under the guise of interview questions was perverse. Palin slammed Cohen and CBS Corp., which owns Showtime, as \u201ctruly sick\u201d and challenged them to donate the money made from the project to \u201ca charitable group that actually respects and supports American Vets.\u201d \u201cMock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want, if that lets you sleep at night, but HOW DARE YOU mock those who have fought and served our country,\u201d Palin said. Palin continued: And as an aside, for further insight into the wealthy corporate enablers of this kind of \u201cjoke\u201d, I\u2019ll add that after great costs on our part in time and resources to contribute to their \u201cdocumentary\u201d the Cohen/CBS/Showtime production team purposefully dropped my daughter and me off at the wrong Washington, DC airport after the fake interview, knowing we\u2019d miss all flights back home to Alaska. After refusing to take our calls to help get us out of the bind they\u2019d put us in for three days, I wrote this off as yet another example of the sick nature that is media-slash-entertainment today. Palin ended her explanation slapping Cohen for his ignorance, \u201cFeel good and manly about your M.O., Sacha? By the way, my daughter thinks you\u2019re a piece of ****, Sacha. Every honorable American Vet should feel the same.\u201d Over the weekend Baron Cohen posted a promotional video to Instagram which showed Cheney signing a \u201cwaterboard kit.\u201d The video came days after Baron Cohen released another promotional video of Donald Trump railing against the Borat star, footage which first appeared in 2012. A Showtime description of Who Is America, which airs Sunday, July 15, says, \u201cIn the works over the past year, the seven-episode series will explore the diverse individuals, from the infamous to the unknown across the political and cultural spectrum, who populate our unique nation.\u201d At press time, Showtime had not publicly responded to Sarah Palin.

      "content": " A source close to Palin with knowledge of the interview told Breitbart News, \u201cCohen pretended to be a disabled veteran from Kentucky who was a big fan of Governor Palin. He was wearing a necklace made of bullets and had a laptop covered in InfoWars stickers.\u201d The bullet necklace and stickers for Alex Jones\u2019 InfoWars website were part of the persona Cohen was playing, the source explained. \u201cHis disguise was basically a caricature of a conservative middle class Trump voter. He was asking her absurd, racist, homophobic, and sexist questions that were all meant to mock Trump voters as a bunch of ignorant and offensive kooks.\u201d Some of the questions focused on Palin\u2019s support of the Second Amendment. \u201cHe was asking her things like, \u2018Why can\u2019t the mentally ill be armed with assault weapons?\u2019\u201d the source said. \u201cHe kept presenting her with ridiculous graphs that she told him were obviously inaccurate and fake.\u201d Throughout it all, Palin \u201cpatiently and politely explained why he was wrong,\u201d the source said, but added that their entire interaction from start to finish was \u201cover two hours long\u201d and Palin has no doubt that it will be \u201cheavily edited to embarrass her.\u201d Ultimately, the source thinks this Cohen prank will \u201cbackfire dramatically\u201d because the fake interview was \u201cthe epitome of a contemptuous Hollywood enclave that hates the ordinary working class Americans who swept Donald Trump into office. This is exactly what the American people voted against in 2016.\u201d The source also provided Breitbart News with the following screenshot of part of the interview proposal Cohen\u2019s production company sent Palin\u2019s speaker\u2019s bureau. Screenshot of the interview proposal Cohen\u2019s CBS/Showtime production company sent to Palin. (Breitbart News) A source told People magazine on Wednesday that Cohen\u2019s interview request \u201cwas very sophisticated and looked legit.\u201d That same source told People that Palin\u2019s \u201clast straw\u201d was a \u201chorrible\u201d question about Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Palin walked out of the interview after that question. \u201cAll of it was obnoxious,\u201d the source told People. \u201c[B]ut I think the last straw was when the interviewer asked about what he claimed was a government-funded sex-change operation for Chelsea Clinton. Cohen was trying to get Governor Palin to say something homophobic and hateful. She takes it personally when anyone goes after the children and families of politicians. She just thought, \u2018What a horrible thing.\u2019 She was particularly incensed about that.\u201d According to People, Palin traveled to Washington, D.C., last November for the interview accompanied by her daughter Piper, 17, who was separated from her mother \u201cfor an hour and a half\u201d and not allowed to leave the trailer where she was being held. Matt Drudge broke the story of Cohen\u2019s latest prank in a Tweet on Tuesday warning readers that Cohen was \u201cat it again! This time for CBS/SHOWTIME.\u201d \u201cLots of tricks played,\u201d Drudge noted. \u201cBoth Republicans and Democrats are getting caught up in the madness.\u201d He specifically named \u201cCheney, Palin, Howard Dean, Alberto Gonzales, Bernie, Trent Lott, Patraeus, Ted Koppel, and more.\u201d Palin then confirmed Drudge\u2019s story on her Facebook page in a long post excoriating Cohen for disguising himself as a disabled veteran. She called on CBS and Showtime to donate the proceeds of this episode to a charity supporting disabled veterans. \u201cThe challenge is to Cohen, CBS and Showtime: donate all proceeds to a charitable group that actually respects and supports American Vets. Mock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want, if that lets you sleep at night, but HOW DARE YOU mock those who have fought and served our country,\u201d Palin wrote.

      "subtitle": "Speaking in a Breitbart News interview, Joe Arpaio, the former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, detailed allegedly being duped into an interview with Sacha Baron Cohen, who Arpaio says posed as a famous comedian from Finland.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " Arpaio, currently running for a U.S. Senate seat in Arizona, said that during the interview he became \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d with some of the words that Cohen\u2019s character allegedly used, including \u201cblowjob,\u201d \u201chand job\u201d and \u201cgolden shower.\u201d He said he was made to believe the interview was being filmed live and that 2 million people were watching. Arpaio says that just prior to the interview, two alleged producers mentioned that they were also interviewing Sarah Palin and claimed that they \u201clove\u201d President Trump, as did Cohen\u2019s character.\u00a0 In a lengthy Facebook post, Palin revealed that she was interviewed by Cohen, who she alleged disguised himself as a disabled U.S. veteran. Cohen\u2019s Showtime character, going by the name of Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr, Ph.D, replied in character on Twitter, claiming that he \u201cwas in the service \u2014 not military, but United Parcel, and I only fought for my country once \u2014 when I shot a Mexican who came onto my property.\u201d Arpaio said the entire episode made him so uneasy that he took the unusual step of typing notes documenting the events. \u201cSomething told me I had better document this,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I typed those notes real fast.\u201d Arpaio shared his notes with Breitbart News. Arpaio said the saga began when he was contacted in the Fall of 2017 by two purported producers going by the names of Phil Simon and Corey Fielder. He said they told him that they were associated with a feature being sold to Showtime and that the show selected him as one of the twenty \u201cmost popular\u201d people in America.\u00a0 He was told that he would be interviewed by a famous Finnish comedian. The former sheriff noted that at the time of the interview request he was a private citizen and did not have his sheriff\u2019s department staff to vet the interview. Arpaio said that he arrived in Los Angeles on October 11, 2017, and that the production team brought him to the filming facility. Arpaio said he was surprised that the interview was not being filmed in a normal television studio but instead in a warehouse-like facility. He said that he was going to Los Angeles at the time anyway to support California congressional candidate Omar Navarro, who is running against Rep. Maxine Waters. According to Arpaio, the production team led him to believe that the host was a Trump supporter. \u00a0He also noted signing a contract, writing, \u201cI signed some kind of contract before filming, which I have done numerous times, did not read all the info.\u201d He said he thought it was unusual that they didn\u2019t offer to powder his face before the interview. Arpaio said that when he arrived on set, the production team immediately made the interview seem like it was live even though he says he was never told that it was purportedly a live interview. He said that there was text on a screen claiming that over 2 million people were watching the interview live.\u00a0 \u201cI was surprised it was live,\u201d said Arpaio. Arpaio does not recall the name that Cohen used besides posing as a famous comedian from Finland. He described Cohen as using props during the interview, included boxes that contained cars. As sheriff, Arpaio famously advocated for stopping the cars of those suspected of being illegal aliens. Questions he was asked involved immigration, guns, Trump playing golf, and running jails in Finland and the U.S., the former sheriff said. Arpaio recalled Cohen using \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d phraseology that he says made him \u201cvery uncomfortable.\u201d \u201cHe came up with certain words which were hard for me to hear,\u201d Arpaio said, including \u201cblowjob\u201d and \u201ctalking about people working for\u201d a \u201chand job.\u201d So I started getting a little pissed,\u201d he said. Cohen also mentioned \u201cgolden shower,\u201d Arpaio stated. Arpaio\u2019s typed notes to document some of those words. \u201cI felt uncomfortable with some of the words they were using but I had to live through it. I am not the type of guy who gets up and walks out,\u201d he said. \u201cI never walked out in thousands of interviews. I just take it.\u201d \u201cI was kind of shocked,\u201d Arpaio continued. \u201cBut I figured this is Finland and this is a famous comedian.\u201d Asked how he thinks he will be portrayed, Arpaio replied that \u201cI was very careful in responding to controversial issues. Profiling. Illegal immigration. They were hitting me with all of that.\u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": "  A partial transcript follows: SMERCONISH:\u00a0So, Congressman, what was the set up in your case? WALSH: Hey Michael, good to be with you and look, let me say at the outset I think Sacha Baron Cohen is a funny guy. I thought Borat was hilarious. Look, in my case, in a lot of the cases, he\u2019s a funny guy because he gets people to say stupid things. He gets people to say stupid things because he lies to them. In my case he flew me out to Washington, D.C., they knew I was a big supporter of Israel, and they presented me with this award as one of Israel\u2019s greatest friends. Found out later the whole thing was a ruse and it was a ruse probably just to get me to say some stupid things. SMERCONISH:\u00a0So, they give you the award and then what? There was some aspect of this where it dealt with Israel using kids to protect itself against terror? WALSH: Yeah Michael, it was just crazy. Look, they flew me out to D.C., they put me up in a hotel, they put me in a limo. They sent me off to this studio in Virginia, again, all under the lie that I was getting an award from [an] Israel T.V. station because I\u2019m a great supporter of Israel. After they conducted an interview, they had me read off of a teleprompter talking about some of the innovative products that Israel\u2019s invented. Then they had me read about this four-year-old child in Israel, who when a terrorist entered his classroom, somehow he grabbed the terrorist\u2019s gun and held the terrorist at bay. That was I guess an example of how Israel trains and arms preschool kids and how to use firearms and boy, shouldn\u2019t we do that in America. So, I\u2019m reading this Michael, off a teleprompter and I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u201cWell this is kind of crazy, but it is Israel and Israel\u2019s strong on defense.\u201d We found out the whole thing was made up. There is no T.V. station, there was no award, and it\u2019s pretty clear that Sacha Baron Cohen wanted me to say something pretty crazy about guns like \u201cin America, we ought to arm preschool kids.\u201d SMERCONISH: Did an alarm go\u00a0off in your head, Congressman? WALSH: Yeah, it did. But again Michael, it was too late because I was in the middle of this fifteen-minute thing talking about all the great things Israel does. So, the alarm went off, but the alarm really went off about three o\u2019clock that next morning when I said, \u201cOh my God, I\u2019ve been duped.\u201d Then we hired an attorney, we looked into it and we found pretty quickly that it was this new special on Showtime that he was producing, Sacha was producing, and we found out as you said Michael, I was alone. Dick Cheney, Sarah Palin, a bunch of us were duped. The Illinois lawmaker-turned-radio host posted on Twitter a photo of himself during the mock interview, along with the fake award for his support of Israel. \u201cI was rushed to the studio, production was a mess, I sat down and we started talking pro-Israel stuff, Israeli defense, and then out of left field the interviewer starts talking about how children should defend themselves against terrorist attacks,\u201d tweeted Walsh.  \u201cI stopped and questioned their direction,\u201d the former Congressman tweeted moments\u00a0later, adding,\u00a0 \u201cAnd just like that producers rushed me out of the studio as an apparent fight broke out. Strangest interview of my life \u2013 don\u2019t think they spoofed me very much \u2013 but I did get this award, thanks @showtime.\u201d  Cohen has come under fire over reports the comedian dupped ex-Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AK) into a prank interview while reportedly disguised as a disabled military veteran. Sen. John McCain\u2019s (R-AZ) former presidential running mate blasted the comedian\u2019s use of the disguise after revealing she may have been duped by Cohen.  \u201cAnother list of unfunny lies, this time typewritten for all to see; a pathetic attempt to punk not just my daughter and me again, but now the public,\u201d Palin wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. \u201cThank God people are wise to Hollywood\u2019s BS & said, \u2018Enough.\u2019\u201d",

Simpson and former Democratic congressman Barney Frank. Such a decision was hinted at by Showtime president of programming Gary Levine earlier this month after he said that Cohen has a \u201cvery high bar\u201d for what makes the final cut. \u201cAll I can say about that is that there are several people who have thrown themselves in front of buses that may not be heading their way,\u201d he told reporters at the time. News that Palin may be involved in the show emerged last month after she revealed that Cohen had duped her by posing as a disabled veteran eager to discuss issues facing the country. \u201cCohen pretended to be a disabled veteran from Kentucky who was a big fan of Governor Palin,\u201d a source close to Palin told Breitbart News at the time. \u201cHe was wearing a necklace made of bullets and had a laptop covered in InfoWars stickers.\u201d \u201cHis disguise was basically a caricature of a conservative middle-class Trump voter,\u201d they continued. \u201cHe was asking her absurd, racist, homophobic, and sexist questions that were all meant to mock Trump voters as a bunch of ignorant and offensive kooks.\u201d Eventually, Sarah Palin walked away from the interview after Cohen asked her a \u201chorrible\u201d question about whether Chelsea Clinton had been subject to a government-funded sex change.\u00a0She has since called on CBS and Showtime to \u201cdonate all proceeds to a charitable group that actually respects and supports American Vets.\u201d Since its debut last month,\u00a0Who is America\u00a0has received generally mixed reviews from critics.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Breitbart News has independently confirmed an earlier report in\u00a0People magazine, which reported that Palin was not sent an invitation and was told through intermediaries to stay away from the ceremony. McCain fundraiser\u00a0Carla Eudy confirmed to\u00a0People that Palin had not been invited \u2014 possibly,\u00a0People speculated, at the behest of the McCain family. The news comes on the tenth anniversary of the date in 2008 when Palin was announced as McCain\u2019s pick for vice president. Palin now joins President Donald Trump on the list of those barred from the funeral. But unlike Trump, Palin never feuded with McCain and never criticized him. When news broke on Saturday of McCain\u2019s passing, Palin said, \u201cToday we lost an American original. Sen. John McCain was a maverick and a fighter, never afraid to stand for his beliefs. John never took the easy path in life \u2014 and through sacrifice and suffering he inspired others to serve something greater than self. \u201cJohn McCain was my friend. I will remember the good times. My family and I send prayers for Cindy and the McCain family.\u201d Last year, when McCain was reported to have\u00a0said that he regretted choosing Palin instead of Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT), Palin described the news as a \u201cgut punch\u201d but refused to blame McCain personally, telling the UK\u00a0Daily Mail that she blamed his \u201cghostwriters\u201d for such reports. When McCain selected Palin as his running mate, the two had both built reputations as corruption-busting \u201cmaverick\u201d leaders who were not afraid to buck their own parties. After the 2008 election, they moved in separate political directions. Palin became an inspirational figure for the Tea Party and for grassroots conservatives in general. McCain campaigned as a conservative border hawk in his 2010 re-election race but became a harsh critic of the Tea Party, calling Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rand Paul (R-KY) \u201cwacko birds.\u201d Many in the Beltway blamed Palin for McCain\u2019s loss in 2008 \u2014 even though Barack Obama had benefited from a sudden financial crisis and a biased press corps. That view seemed to have seeped into McCain\u2019s own thinking. Still, Palin never took offense and always honored McCain. Even after being excluded from the funeral, she declined to criticize him. People quoted a source close to the Palin family: \u201c[O]ut of respect for Sen. McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point. The Palin family will always cherish their friendship with the McCains and hold those memories dear.\u201d McCain will be laid to rest on Sunday in Annapolis, following several days of memorial events and ceremonies.

      "subtitle": "Perhaps the most revealing moment in the week-long media extravaganza over John McCain\u2019s death came on September 1, when Meghan McCain, daughter of the late senator, chose to use her \u201ceulogy\u201d to rip into Donald Trump.",
      "author": "Virgil",
      "content": " Here\u2019s how The Washington Post set the scene: Trump was absent and his name never invoked, but the entire service was animated by a sustained rebellion against the president\u2019s worldview and his singular brand of politics. \u201cWe gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness,\u201d she said, gritting her teeth through the tears. \u201cThe real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.\u201d Okay, we get it: Ms. McCain hates Trump so much that she has to grit her teeth when she talks about him.\u00a0 Trump and his supporters already knew that, of course. And as an aside, we might note that the good news is that in making her hatred so evident, Ms. McCain surely kiboshed any chance that Arizona Governor Doug Ducey would appoint her to fill her father\u2019s senate seat, as some\u2014even some who bill themselves as conservative\u2014have suggested. Meghan McCain speaks at a memorial service for her father at the Washington National Cathedral, September 1, 2018. (SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) However, even if the younger McCain will never be an Arizona Republican, she can still be a Establishment Republican. \u00a0You see, she is an expert in telling the Establishment what it wants to hear\u2014and the Establishment will hugely reward her for her \u201ccourage.\u201d\u00a0 Once again, the Post, that reliable reflector of Beltway conventional wisdom, sets the scene: When she fiercely declared that \u201cthe America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great,\u201d the generals, senators, former presidents and other world leaders who filled the pews burst into applause. We might linger over those last words: \u201cburst into applause.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s worth recalling that this was supposed to be a funeral service, and yet Ms. McCain turned it into a kind of political rally for the Establishment and for what it sees as the \u201cgood old days.\u201d\u00a0 Ah, for the good old days of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mitt Romney, George W. Bush, and \u2026 John McCain.\u00a0 The days when the Establishment, for sure, was great\u2014or at least greatly in charge. From left: former President George W. Bush, former first lady Laura Bush, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne, and former Vice President Al Gore. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Former President Barack Obama speaks at a memorial service for John McCain. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Yes, in the Establishment\u2019s collective mentality, the good old days were the time when the U.S. border was open, when trade deals were easy, and foreign wars were being fought. The Establishment, of course, never cared that, as a result, social chaos was increasing, wages were declining,\u00a0 regions were de-industrializing, and young Heartlanders\u2014not Establishmentarians, of course\u2014were getting killed and maimed overseas.\u00a0 So when Meghan McCain defined those days as \u201cgreatness,\u201d well, that was what the Establishmentarians came to hear. \u00a0 She was patting the big shots on the back, and they were glad for the pat.\u00a0 And John McCain, of course, was the champion of that sort of Beltway bonhomie\u2014and, especially, the bipartisan \u201cfun\u201d of foreign wars. Except when he was running for re-election in Arizona, McCain made no apologies for any of his views, even as they ultimately drove down his approval rating, among Arizona Republicans, to just 20 percent\u2014with a whopping 68 percent disapproving.\u00a0 Indeed, according to another poll, McCain was the third-most unpopular Senator in the nation. Yet to the Establishment, such unpopularity is a badge of honor; that is, if a political figure is willing to \u201cstand up\u201d to the dopey masses, well, that\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0 So it\u2019s little wonder that John McCain received the John F. Kennedy \u201cProfile in Courage\u201d award, that annual liberal smug-fest.\u00a0 And now, maybe Meghan McCain will win it, too. Indeed, Ms. McCain won extra points with the Establishment by snubbing Sarah Palin. The former Alaska governor had been John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2008, and had delivered what\u2019s commonly regarded as the greatest vice presidential acceptance speech in modern memory. So if the McCain-Palin ticket lost in \u201908, it certainly wasn\u2019t her fault. And yet to the Establishment\u2014including the many McCain campaign staffers who now make their living on MSNBC\u2014Palin was hopelessly deplorable. She was too much the populist and no kind of elitist. So by not inviting Palin to the service, the McCains made it clear that they wanted nothing to do with the Deplorables, now and forever. Thus we see that class warfare is alive and well within the Republican Party\u2014assuming, that is, that the McCains still think of themselves as Republicans at all. On Twitter, observers made smart points. For instance, Kurt Schlichter compared the McCain service to the October 2002 memorial for the late senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN).\u00a0 While campaigning for re-election, Wellstone had died in a plane crash, and that was a sad thing\u2014and yet the memorial service turned into a raucous Democratic political rally, and in the resulting backlash, the Republican candidate, Norm Coleman, won the November 2002 election. Meanwhile, a parody account called \u201cStephen Miller\u201d quipped, \u201cDonald Trump wasn\u2019t invited to John McCain\u2019s funeral, because Republican presidents are usually not invited to Democrat campaign rallies.\u201d Yet Virgil was particularly struck by a string of tweets from Michael Tracey, an independent journalist of notable independence: This funeral was one last demonstration of McCain\u2019s belief in \u201cbipartisanship\u201d for its own sake.\u00a0 It almost doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re doing, as long as you\u2019re \u201cworking together.\u201d\u00a0 Just so happens that McCain\u2019s primary \u201cbipartisan\u201d initiative was endless war. That seemed like a funeral not so much for McCain, but for an ideology which had once sustained America\u2019s imperial hegemony, and is now on the way out.  Some of those last few words deserve a second look: \u201cSeemed like a funeral not so much for McCain, but for an ideology which had once sustained America\u2019s imperial hegemony, and is now on the way out.\u201d Tracey\u2019s argument is that McCain-style \u201cneoconservatism,\u201d which can be summed up as invade the world, invite the world, is now a goner. \u00a0While the Establishment\u2014including plenty of Democrats\u2014loves it, most Americans don\u2019t. In fact, it\u2019s not surprising that imperial grandiosity plays well in blue Washington, DC, and in New York City; after all, it\u2019s fun to get rich and noble from imperialism.\u00a0 What\u2019s less fun is to be a legionary from some red state, slogging it out in a hostile land, all for the sake of someone else\u2019s ideological empire.

(U.S. Department of Defense/The National Security Archive) Air Force Major Terry Dutcher visits the grave of her son, Army Corporal Michael Avery Pursel, who died serving in Iraq in 2007 at age 19. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The America people, of course, have always had the power to put a stop to all this grandiose globalism, if\u00a0and when they choose to exercise that power at the ballot box. Finally, in 2016, they did.\u00a0 That was the story of Donald Trump, who romped through the Republican primaries, and then to the White House. And it was also the story of the 2016 Democratic primaries, when Sen. Bernie Sanders nearly defeated Hillary Clinton for the nomination.\u00a0 (Interestingly, Sanders was also not in attendance for the McCain service, although, of course, Hillary was there; she was sitting right by another foreign-war enthusiast, Dick Cheney.) \u00a0 Moreover, since 2016, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that the populist anti-Establishment rebellion is continuing, in both parties. So yes, Tracey has a point: The Establishment will cheer for Meghan McCain, and its handmaidens in the MSM were happy to make the whole of last week into a McCain Mediathon.\u00a0 And yet at the same time, the Establishment is deathly afraid that it can\u2019t put the old humpty-dumpty back together.\u00a0 It fears that the American people won\u2019t get fooled again; no more will they let themselves get conned by the neocons.\u00a0 John McCain really is gone. In fact, watching the McCain services, Virgil was reminded of another famed memorial service for doomed royalty\u2014this one for real royalty, back in 1910.\u00a0 In that year, Britain\u2019s King Edward VII passed away, and all the crowned heads of Europe came to London to pay homage.\u00a0 History buffs will recall that 1910 was just four years before the beginning of World War One; that disastrous conflict, of course, spelled the end of many of those royal dynasties, as well as the actual murder of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and much of his family.\u00a0 Thus Edward VII\u2019s funeral is remembered as a kind of Indian Summer for that earlier imperial era. Here\u2019s how the famed historian Barbara Tuchman described the moment in her classic study of the of origins of World War One, The Guns of August: So gorgeous was the spectacle on the May morning of 1910 when nine kings rode in the funeral of Edward VII of England that the crowd, waiting in hushed and black-clad awe, could not keep back gasps of admiration. In scarlet and blue and green and purple, three by three the sovereigns rode through the palace gates, with plumed helmets, gold braid, crimson sashes, and jeweled orders flashing in the sun.\u00a0 After them came five heirs apparent, forty more imperial or royal highnesses, seven queens\u2013four dowager and three regnant\u2013and a scattering of special ambassadors from uncrowned countries.\u00a0 Together they represented seventy nations in the greatest assemblage of royalty and rank ever gathered in one place and, of its kind, the last. The muffled tongue of Big Ben tolled nine by the clock as the cortege left the palace, but on history\u2019s clock it was sunset, and the sun of the old world was setting in a dying blaze of splendor never to be seen again. Those last words deserve another look: But on history\u2019s clock it was sunset, and the sun of the old world was setting in a dying blaze of splendor never to be seen again.

(Wikimedia Commons) The ceremonial pomp and circumstance of 1910 would soon be displaced by the un-ceremonial blood and mud of 1914, and 1915, and 1916, and 1917, and 1918.\u00a0 By the time the Great War was over, 10 million were dead\u2014and dead, too, was any confidence that the royals knew what they were doing, or that they were to be trusted with any sort of power.\u00a0 It was the end, for sure, of that establishment. 1914, Great Britain: Members of the Royal Fusiliers marching off to war at the start of World War One.

(Topical Press Agency/Getty Images) It seems to Virgil that a similar ending is happening now.\u00a0 The American Establishment might know, down deep, that it has screwed up in its hubris\u2014although, of course, that can never be admitted publicly.\u00a0 Can\u2019t show weakness to the proles! Nevertheless, the Establishment is visibly growing nervous.\u00a0 In its jitteriness, it is clapping wildly, and inappropriately, for those who still hold to the fading faith\u2014such as the McCain family. Yet most of all, the Establishment is raging against the dying of the light.\u00a0 Amidst the hot lights and the hot rhetoric of the McCain funeral-turned-festival, the elites know that this is their political twilight and that dusk is giving way to nightfall. And yet Establishmentarians fear, most of all, that a new and different sun is rising.",

John McCain (R-AZ).",
      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " Here we are in an America with a roaring economy, manufacturing jobs are coming back (without a magic wand), the War on Terror feels like ancient history, we\u2019re not launching stupid wars, Putin\u2019s adventurism\u2019s been halted, and North Korea has gone from launching missiles to arguing over how quickly it will denuclearize\u2026 In other words, for the first time in 17 years, for the first time since those passenger planes hit the World Trade Center, we are at long last enjoying some well-deserved Peace and Prosperity. But how did our self-appointed media and political elite spend the last few days? Lashing out at the man primarily responsible for America\u2019s comeback while longing for the good ol\u2019 days when they were in charge of endless wars and managing America\u2019s decline. And all of this happened at the most inappropriate venue imaginable: a funeral. There is only one way to describe what we witnessed over the last few days. Basically, in front of the whole world, we watched those who piously lecture the rest of us about decency, decorum, and civility, bare their sorry asses. And this baring of elite asses did not happen at just any funeral. The passing of the legendary Aretha Franklin and war hero John McCain\u2026 These should have been unifying events, a time for America to come together to practice the traditions that unite us, to engage in the kind of unified civic behavior our Apostles of Decency claim to lament the loss of. If nothing else, this was their opportunity to show us Trumptards how it\u2019s done\u2026 Watch us unite the country! Watch us lead by example! Watch us be the change we want! But what did they do instead? Pulled their pants down. And this happened for only one reason: Trump doesn\u2019t just live in their heads \u2014 he\u2019s in there blasting Chuck Berry, banging Playboy Bunnies in threes, wolfing down cheeseburgers, and accomplishing what they never could: making America great again. Over at Instapundit, Glenn Reynolds puts it best: \u201cOne of Trump\u2019s major accomplishments has been to reveal the lack of civic virtue and self-control across our elite institutions.\u201d Trump has forced them to reveal who they really are. May I be honest? Am I allowed to be honest in the age of CorrectThink? Please do argue with me if you disagree, but if the media reports are true, was it not John McCain himself who set the childish tone with his mean-girl invite list? Apparently, he spent eight months planning his own funeral, which was,\u00a0to begin with, \u2014 am I allowed to say it? \u2014 just a tad ostentatious. But to snub a sitting president, to snub Sarah Palin, his unfailingly loyal 2008 vice presidential running mate? What was that other than petty and childish? If I wanted Trump to look bad, I would have invited him to my funeral in the hope he would make himself look bad. If the man is as boorish as our Ruling Class says, why not be the bigger man, even if you are hoping to set him up? But someone who did make McCain\u2019s invite list was credibly accused rapist and perjurer Bill Clinton. And on the invite list at Aretha\u2019s funeral was that same credibly accused rapist and perjurer Bill Clinton, who shared the front row dais with raging racist and anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan, anti-Semite Al Sharpton, and Jesse \u201cHymietown\u201d Jackson. This was the least of it, though. The behavior at both of these funerals was so cheap, so crass\u2026 And all of it on national television. To begin with, in a fit of mean-spiritedness that beggars belief, the McCains obviously invited Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared to humiliate them, to force them to sit there as Meghan McCain and former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush\u00a0took cheap shots at Ivanka\u2019s father. Worse still, while a war hero\u2019s national funeral was turned into a bitter and divisive campaign rally, a cathedral full of elites cheered. Meanwhile, over at Aretha\u2019s funeral, the very same people teeing off on Trump ogled Ariana Grande and then groped her breast and then \u2014 no joke \u2014 made a joke about Grande being a \u201cnew something at Taco Bell.\u201d These are the people lecturing us about decency, y\u2019all. All I could think of was The Masque of the Red Death\u00a0or, as \u201cVirgil\u201d put it, \u201cthe Establishment is raging against the dying of the light [and] know that this is their political twilight[.]\u201d Trump\u2019s accomplishments are not only making fools of establishment elites; his accomplishments are goading establishment elites into making fools of themselves.

Frank Murkowski, a former two-term senator who was elected governor of Alaska, served one term before Palin defeated him in the Republican gubernatorial primary. Palin, who had been appointed to Alaska\u2019s powerful oil and gas commission board by Frank Murkowski, won broad public support from Alaskans due to her record as a reformer and whistleblower who called out the corruption in the Murkowski administration for cronyism with the big oil companies, an action which led to the largest ethics fine in Alaska history. Frank Murkowski also faced criticism for nepotism when he appointed his daughter, Lisa Murkowski, to his vacant U.S. Senate seat. In 2010, Palin, then the former Republican vice-presidential candidate, backed Tea Party Senate challenger Joe Miller over Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Prior to voting against advancing Kavanaugh, Murkowski suggested that she will oppose President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee this weekend. \u201cI believe that Brett Kavanaugh is a good man. It just may be that in my view he\u2019s not the right man for the court at this time,\u201d Murkowski told reporters on Capitol Hill. She said she respected her colleagues\u2019 support for Kavanaugh, adding, \u201cI also think we\u2019re at a place where we need to think about the credibility and integrity of our institutions.\u201d After remaining undecided on whether Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination should move forward, Murkowski rendered her decision Friday in dramatic fashion. As the clerk read the names in alphabetical order, all eyes were on Murkowski. Senators stood up in their chairs and voted, some of them loudly. But when it came to Murkowski, she stood up, paused, and whispered \u201cno,\u201d her voice barely audible. Then she took her seat, looking down with a stone-faced expression. As the end of the vote neared, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who sits next to Murkowski, leaned over and put her hand on the arm of Murkowski\u2019s chair. The two huddled in deep conversation. A spokeswoman for Murkowski could not immediately confirm that the senator will oppose Kavanaugh on the final vote expected Saturday, but indicated it appeared that way. Kavanaugh could still win confirmation if Murkowski is the only Republican to oppose him. Murkowski claimed she agonized over her vote, telling reporters she didn\u2019t make up her mind until she walked into the Senate chamber. \u201cThis has truly been the most difficult evaluation of a decision that I\u2019ve ever had to make, and I\u2019ve made some interesting ones in my political career,\u201d she said.

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " The party has asked Murkowski to provide any information she may want its state central committee to evaluate as it considers whether to reprimand the lawmaker. Party Chairman Tuckerman Babcock says the committee could decide to issue a statement condemning\u00a0Murkowski or withdraw support from the senator. Futher, Babcock could encourage\u00a0party officials to search for a replacement and request that she not seek re-election as a Republican. Read the state party\u2019s full statement on Murkowski\u2019s opposition to Kavanaugh: We are both shocked and disappointed by the decision of US Senator Lisa Murkowski to oppose the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh. The Alaska Republican Party supports his confirmation. We respect the process, but after the process ran its course, the time came for the Senate to do their duty and advise and consent, or not. We expected many Democrats to remain adamant in opposition to the nomination by President Trump. We did not expect Republicans to end in opposition. Werepeat, we are both shocked and disappointed by the opposition to the confirmation from just one Republican, Senator Murkowski. This is a very significant vote. And the Alaska Republican Party will have a very significant response. However, it will not be the response of one man. As Chairman, while I have the authority under our Rules to speak on behalf of the Party, this issue is just too significant. How we respond as Republicans will be brought before the entire grassroots leadership of the Party: the State Central Committee. As representatives of 140,000 members of the Alaska Republican Party, we will consider what action to take. We will deliberate, and discuss and then vote on exactly what our response will be to her vote against confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court. After remaining undecided on whether Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination should move forward, Murkowski rendered her decision Friday in dramatic fashion. As the clerk read the names in alphabetical order, all eyes were on Murkowski. Senators stood up in their chairs and voted, some of them loudly. But when it came to Murkowski, she stood up, paused, and whispered \u201cno,\u201d her voice barely audible. Then she took her seat, looking down with a stone-faced expression. As the end of the vote neared, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who sits next to Murkowski, leaned over and put her hand on the arm of Murkowski\u2019s chair. The two huddled in deep conversation. Collins and Murkowski are the only GOP senators who support abortion rights, a crucial issue in the debate over Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. If confirmed, Kavanaugh could tip the court\u2019s balance toward conservatives for a generation. Collins said Kavanaugh assured her during a private meeting that Roe v. Wade, the ruling that established abortion rights, is settled law. Murkowski\u2019s decision brought a swift response from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who insinuated that she might mount a primary challenge against the senator if she opposes Kavanaugh. Palin, who was GOP presidential candidate John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2008, tweeted, \u201cHey @lisamurkowski \u2014 I can see 2022 from my house.\u201d The tweet referenced an infamous Saturday Night Live skit in which Tina Fey, portraying Palin, said she could see Russia from her house. Murkowski is next up for re-election in 2022.  Murkowski acknowledged she agonized over her vote, telling reporters she didn\u2019t make up her mind until she walked into the Senate chamber. \u201cThis has truly been the most difficult evaluation of a decision that I\u2019ve ever had to make, and I\u2019ve made some interesting ones in my political career,\u201d the Republican senator said. Over the weekend,\u00a0President Donald Trump told the Washington Post\u00a0that\u00a0Murkowski will \u201cnever recover\u201d from voting against Kavanaugh. \u201cI think the people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did,\u201d he said.

Other than violence, what is left? In all seriousness, how can Democrats become \u201cmore ruthless\u201d than they have already been without resorting to violence? The Politico piece is utterly deranged in its fact-free premise, including anti-science nonsense such as, \u201cDemocrats keep playing by a set of rules.\u201d What? Are we talking about the same Democrats who violated every norm to hold onto Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations against Kavanaugh until it could do the maximum damage? Are we talking about the same Democrats who used procedural trickery to pass Obamacare? The same Democrats who nuked the Senate filibuster? Who politicized the FBI to try to frame Trump as a Russian spy? Who weaponized the IRS against the Tea Party? Who accused Mitt Romney of murder? Who investigated Sarah Palin\u2019s womb? Who accused Palin of a mass murder in Arizona? Who invented Borking? Who threatened a broadcast network\u2019s license over a miniseries? Who are promising to pack the Supreme Court with more justices? Those Democrats? Those Democrats seriously believe they are playing by the rules and need to become even more ruthless? Already, and with the silent (and sometimes not-too-silent) approval of Democrats, Breitbart News has documented over 580 individual acts of violence, vandalism, harassment, and threats aimed at Trump supporters. Already, and with the silent (and sometimes vocal) approval of the Democrats\u2019 allies in the establishment media, over 580 acts of ruthlessness have been committed against Trump supporters during the Trump era. The Politico article continues: Whether Trump knew it or not, his remarks were perfectly pitched to stoke anxieties that have haunted many top Democratic operatives for a generation: the fear that their party loses big power struggles because Republicans are simply tougher, meaner, more cynical and more ruthless than they are. If after all of the above, Democrats fear they must become even more ruthless to obtain power, I guess we now know why they are so desperate to abolish the Second Amendment.

Palin\u2019s comments were sparked by a Friday interview where Rock made to criticize political correctness and brought Behar into the conversation. On Live TV, Rock told Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy, \u201cGod forbid you say something a little bit wrong you\u2019re racist, homophobic, Islamophobic\u2026 people need to calm down, a get a little less politically correct, and, I would say love everybody. Except I\u2019d say screw that Joy Behar bitch, everybody but that.\u201d Rock later apologized for using the curse word but did not apologize for the sentiment he was trying to relay to viewers. \u201cBehar has been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, and when myself, Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent visited the White House last year, Behar called it \u2018the saddest day in the history of the White House since the British burned it to the ground in 1814,'\u201d Rock said in a statement released later on Friday. \u201cToday I said \u2018Screw that Joy Behar b\u2014h.\u2019 Mess with the bull, you get the horns. End of story. I apologized for cursing on live TV, I will not for my sentiment nor do I expect an apology from her or anyone else who has choice words for me or doesn\u2019t like me.

      "author": "Justin Caruso",
      "content": " \u201cYour response to your Golden Globes nomination was to invite Sarah Palin to be your date. She complained she had been duped but she was nowhere to be found in the series. Why, and what did we miss?\u201d a reporter from Deadline asked Sacha Baron Cohen. He replied: The upsetting answer is, I don\u2019t think you missed much. There was a lot of pressure on me from the channel to put out Palin. And obviously, she did the only publicity for the show because I did zero interviews. There was no other publicity at all for the show. Thanks to her, people knew that the show was coming. But ultimately, I looked at the footage and it just wasn\u2019t funny enough. For the pieces to be good, there has to be a good comic dynamic. She was just delivering these kind of rote answers, as if she was doing a campaign speech. And even though I sat with her I think for about two-and-a-half hours, there was no comedy gold. (emphasis added) The Borat funnyman made news over the summer with his Showtime series in which he wore disguises to fool a number of political figures with faux interviews. His series notably featured Dick Cheney, with Cohen posing as an Israeli military man and asking Cheney what his \u201cfavorite war\u201d was.  The series did not, however, feature the interview he did with former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, despite much media attention it generated when Palin revealed that Cohen pretended to be a disabled veteran during the interview. She reportedly\u00a0walked out\u00a0of the interview in disgust when Cohen asked her an offensive question mocking Chelsea Clinton. Breitbart News reported in July: A source close to Palin with knowledge of the interview told Breitbart News, \u201cCohen pretended to be a disabled veteran from Kentucky who was a big fan of Governor Palin. He was wearing a necklace made of bullets and had a laptop covered in InfoWars stickers.\u201d \u2026 \u201cHis disguise was basically a caricature of a conservative middle class Trump voter. He was asking her absurd, racist, homophobic, and sexist questions that were all meant to mock Trump voters as a bunch of ignorant and offensive kooks.\u201d \u2026 \u201cHe was asking her things like, \u2018Why can\u2019t the mentally ill be armed with assault weapons?\u2019\u201d the source said. \u201cHe kept presenting her with ridiculous graphs that she told him were obviously inaccurate and fake.\u201d \u201cIf people tune into this show, then they\u2019re going to see how middle-class Americans are mocked and our values are mocked,\u201d Palin said of the show at the time. Cohen also told Deadline that he believes Donald Trump\u2019s election has made Americans feel more comfortable being racist. \u201cI think the population has changed and that\u2019s a result of the president legitimizing these views,\u201d he said. The 47-year-old also said that his motivation for making the Who Is America? came from a feeling of \u201canger and total disgust\u201d at Trump\u2019s presidency.",

      "subtitle": "Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life and Missionaries of the Gospel of Life and president of the National Pro-life Religious Council, heralded President Donald Trump as \u201cthe most pro-life president we have ever had,\u201d offering his remarks in a Thursday interview on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.",
      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " Mansour asked about the theme of science for Friday\u2019s March for Life in Washington, DC. Pavone explained, \u201cThe speakers at the rally and also at the educational convention, which actually started today, sponsored by the March for Life, are focusing on this theme that good pro-life thinking is good science, and vice-versa.\u201d  Pavone continued, \u201cOur position is that there\u2019s one objective line that is already drawn. It\u2019s not drawn by any government or any particular interest group. One line that already exists that should be the defining line when we\u2019re going to protect people or not is the biological event by which it was first decided that any one of us would be male or female or what color our eyes would be or any one of countless genetic qualities and characteristics we have. It was all decided at the same event, namely, our fertilization.\u201d Pavone added, \u201cThis is a basic scientific fact. Pick up an embryology book, or you ask an eighth-grade biology student, \u2018When does an individual\u2019s unique human life begin?\u2019 The answer is objective science.\u201d Pavone said, \u201cA lot of people look at a pro-life movement or a march like tomorrow\u2019s, and they\u2019ll say, \u2018These people are trying to impose their religion or morality on others.\u2019 It\u2019s actually the opposite because we believe in freedom of religion. People can have any philosophy or idea they want about personhood or the soul or even the value of life, but the law doesn\u2019t impose those beliefs. The law protects people despite those beliefs.\u201d Pavone went on, \u201cIf someone came along and said that you or I were not human, we don\u2019t want the law to make them believe we\u2019re human. We want the law to protect our lives no matter what they believe. They have the freedom to believe what they want, and that\u2019s what the pro-life movement is saying. These babies in the womb are identifiably, undeniably, scientifically human beings and, therefore, they should be protected by the law.\u201d Mansour shared an anecdote of a friend of hers who \u201cbecame pro-life\u201d while studying genetics. \u201cI remember a friend that I went to college with when she was studying pre-med,\u201d recalled Mansour. \u201cShe was having to take genetics classes, the early gene stuff. That was when she became pro-life\u00a0because she realized this is a human being. This is a unique life. This isn\u2019t just a glob of tissues. The science has moved us in the pro-life direction, especially the science of sonograms.\u201d Pavone concurred, \u201cWe\u2019re in an age now where the first photograph in your photo album is you still in the womb. Sonograms have really moved the debate forward. There are some projects we\u2019ve been involved in that go even deeper than the ultrasound. There are techniques where you can put a camera right up against the amniotic sac and see the baby at four, five, six weeks in living color.\u201d Pavone added, \u201cI invite people to just look at this stuff. Look it up online. You can see the pictures of these babies, and that\u2019s where we have to start. I think we\u2019ve not really had a debate on abortion for the last fifty years in this country. A lot of times we feel like we\u2019re having the debate, but the two sides are talking past each other.\u201d Pavone stated, \u201cWe say the word \u2018abortion,\u2019 marchers that are going to march to tomorrow. We have a clear idea in mind. We see the baby we\u2019re talking about, and we see what abortion does to the baby. Folks on the other side who are opposing us, they\u2019re talking about something different. They\u2019re not talking about abortions. They\u2019re talking about freedom, the Constitution, women\u2019s rights, women\u2019s health. Fine, we can talk about those things. But if you\u2019re going to talk about abortion, you need to look at the baby, and then you need to look at what abortion does to the baby, and that is where the debate begins.\u201d Pavone went on, \u201cYou just have to see for yourself. It\u2019s science. People look at these photos, these images, and these videos, and they say, \u2018Wow. In a generic sense, I knew it was a human life, but wow, this baby is way more developed than I thought.'\u201d Mansour remarked, \u201cI worked for former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for many years, and she was very articulate on this issue. She had a very compassionate stance on it. She always talked about how we need to be able to reach out to women who are struggling with an unplanned pregnancy\u2026 and really offer them a real choice.\u201d Mansour continued, \u201cThe choice can\u2019t just be abortion. If you\u2019re a real feminist \u2014 my former boss used to say \u2014 then you really want women to have a real choice, the ability to choose life. That, to me, always seems to be the big challenge for those of us who are pro-life. How are we doing in building a culture of life and making it possible for women to choose life?\u201d Pavone shared, \u201cOne of the most beautiful things about tomorrow\u2019s march is that so many of these marchers, when they are back home the rest of the year, they are working in pregnancy centers. The pregnancy centers around our country now outnumber the abortion facilities by about five to one. Pregnancy centers have people who are, every day, giving counseling, helping people find legal services, job and education opportunities they can pursue while having the child, assisting them to give birth to that baby.\u201d Pavone went on, \u201cThis is the positive work of the pro-life movement, giving those alternatives. That\u2019s actually the first part of our message. Whenever we talk about this [and] whenever the pro-life movement presents itself \u2014 who are we? what do we do? \u2014 We help those that feel they need to have an abortion to see that there are other alternatives. That really is the good news about the pro-life movement.\u201d Mansour asked Pavone about Trump\u2019s approach towards the pro-life movement\u2019s concerns. \u201cTell us about how you view President Trump [and] his stand on abortion and pro-life issues,\u201d requested Mansour. \u201cThis is a person many people looked askance at, didn\u2019t think he was being for real [on pro-life issues] when he was a candidate, and yet he seems to have kept all of his promises on this issue. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\u201d Pavone answered, \u201cLet me summarize it this way: I have a Make America Great Again hat, and I have worn it publicly. I was one of the first Catholic leaders to come out in support of him during the primaries, and he asked me to be part of two coalitions: a pro-life advisory group and a Catholic advisory group.\u201d \u201cThis is a man who listens,\u201d assessed Pavone. \u201cWhen he doesn\u2019t know something, he wants to learn it. He surrounds himself with people who can inform him. I have come to the conclusion, as many other pro-life leaders have, he is the most pro-life president we have ever had, and I\u2019m talking about pro-life specifically \u2014 of course, in relation to the abortion issue, the protection of the youngest babies among us.\u201d Pavone added, \u201cThis man has gone above and beyond even what he promised. For example, he reinstated the Mexico City Policy, but then he expanded it to protect our taxpayer dollars from organizations that perform or promote abortions overseas.\u201d Pavone concluded, \u201cTime and time again, in many other examples, he has not only kept his promises;\u00a0he\u2019s gone above and beyond. I think he\u2019s the best friend that our movement for the unborn has ever had in the White House.\u201d Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

      "author": "Michelle Moons",
      "content": " Peter Paul Ferrero was arrested in September 2014 and charged with felony stalking of Bristol Palin after climbing onto a third story balcony of her house. He approached her when she arrived home to find him on the property and she fled. She and sister Willow Palin had received thousands of messages from the offender despite numerous attempts to make it stop. Each sister filed temporary protective orders against Ferrero. Ferrero had been hired as an Alaska State Legislative page but was dismissed before long, according to the Alaska Landmine. The report cited sources that said the House Sergeant at Arms approved the hire. Democrat state Sen. Tom Begich, whose brother former U.S. Senator Mark Begich (D-AK) has a contentious history with former Gov. Palin, contracted Ferrero for work despite the short-lived page position. Ferrero volunteered for Tom Begich\u2019s 2016 campaign while on probation, according to a statement from Begich provided to the Landmine. Begich said he encouraged Ferrero to go to school and that, despite some setbacks, he had completed probation and earned a law clerk certification. \u201cWhen he found himself out of work here, I gave him a small contract to research crime statistics and to help me better understand how gangs get into Alaska, drawing on his own experience in the system and his research,\u201d Begich told the outlet. Ferrero violated parole in 2017. He was arrested near the Palin home, according to court documents cited by the Blast. The report states that he became combative with police trying to arrest him and was accused of assaulting two. Police attested he twice tried to take control of an officer\u2019s firearm. Ferrero has worked for other Democrat political campaigns. The Landmine reported that in 2018 he worked as campaign manager for Representative Chris Tuck. Tuck told the outlet that he met Ferrero first at one of his fundraisers in 2016. \u201cWorking with him, I was impressed with the insight he had on politics and decided to hire him on my campaign. He his a big heart for people and he did a fantastic job,\u201d Tuck said. The representative called Ferrero a \u201cchanged man\u201d and was \u201csurprised\u201d to learn of his past. Identifying himself as \u201cPeter Paul,\u201d Ferrero participated in a meeting at the Alaska State Capitol in Juneau Tuesday. Near the end of the meeting one of the officials requested information on which office he was representing. After Ferrero hesitated and acted conflicted in answering the question, he eventually replied that he was there as a \u201cprivate individual.\u201d Michelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News \u2014 follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook",

      "author": "James P. Pinkerton",
      "content": " Second of a series. In Part One of this series, published on April 6, we considered the fluctuation in Trump administration healthcare policy over the previous couple of weeks.\u00a0Those fluctuations led President Trump to tweet on April 3 that he would wait until after the 2020 elections to seek a congressional vote on his healthcare plan. At the time, most observers took that to mean that the White House would wait until after November 2020 to release its plan. A plan, that is, as distinct from something to actually be voted on. After all, the Democrats in control of the House aren\u2019t interested in working with Trump, and the Republicans who run the Senate aren\u2019t into healthcare changes, either.\u00a0In fact, according to Axios, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recalled telling Trump in late March: Just so we don\u2019t have any misunderstandings, we are not going to vote on health care before 2020. Just so we\u2019re clear.\u00a0 And I\u2019m not going to put together a working group. If you want a plan, it\u2019s going to have to be yours. But we\u2019re not going to vote on it. Recalling the Senate\u2019s debacle of the \u201crepeal and replace\u201d effort in 2017, one might empathize with McConnell\u2019s reluctance to touch healthcare. In the Kentuckian\u2019s calculation, with 21 Republican Senate seats on the line next year, what\u2019s the point of releasing a healthcare plan if you don\u2019t intend to have a vote on it?\u00a0 After all, if the plan is so popular that everyone loves it, why wait two years for a vote?\u00a0 Or, on the other hand, if the plan is not popular, why put it out there and let people shoot at it for two years, making Senate Republicans, in the meantime, the collateral damage? Yet these days, there\u2019s always a twist in the tale.\u00a0On April 7, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday that the administration expects to release its new healthcare plan\u2014a proposed replacement for Obamacare\u2014soon: \u201cI do think you\u2019ll see a plan here fairly shortly.\u201d In the meantime, we already have some clues as to at least some possible features of the plan.\u00a0For instance, Trump has long said that he wants to protect those with preexisting medical conditions.\u00a0That\u2019s understandable, since support for such protection, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), stands at 75 percent. To be sure, some critics have sniped that Trump policies would have the effect of undercutting such protection, but as of now, at least, the danger seems remote.\u00a0Moreover, the President himself is emphatic on protection.\u00a0On April 3, a Trump tweet included the pledge, \u201cRepublicans will always support pre-existing conditions!\u201d We might pause to consider what a pledge to protect those with preexisting conditions means for any health insurance plan: It means that it has to be big and ambitious.\u00a0We\u2019ll get to some of the reasons why ambition is necessary in a future installment, but for now, we might consider the fate of the last president who had a big and ambitious healthcare plan. That last president, of course, was Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama. If the healthcare issue is due for a revival, as the 45th president is indicating, then it\u2019s worth recalling\u2014and seeking to learn from\u2014some of the pitfalls that befell the 44th president. Sen. Barack Obama announces that he will seek the Democrat nomination for president while speaking to a crowd gathered in Springfield, Illinois, in February 2007. (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) When then-Sen. Obama announced his presidential candidacy on February 10, 2007, he was bold and declarative:\u00a0\u201cWe will have universal healthcare in America by the end of the next president\u2019s first term.\u201d\u00a0In that year, 2007, support for national health insurance was at a high: according to Gallup, 69 percent. National health insurance, of course, had been a staple of Democrat politics since the 1940s, and yet it had never been achieved, although Democrats had made partial\u00a0gains along the way\u2014most notably, the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Yet in his campaign, Obama put forth a new and novel argument: His national health plan, massive expansion of Uncle Sam\u2019s role that it was, would actually save money.\u00a0How so? Well, that was never exactly clear, beyond the usual promises of better management and greater efficiency. Still, Obama was so sure of himself that he added specificity: His plan, he pledged, would \u201cbring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family.\u201d\u00a0 This was at\u00a0a time when the average cost of health insurance for a family of four was a little over $12,000. So we can see: In tossing around that figure of $2,500 in savings, Obama was promising a reduction in overall cost of more than a fifth. For those willing to take Obama at his word, that was a great offer. By contrast, Obama\u2019s Republican opponent that year, John McCain, was offering a far more modest healthcare program, consisting mostly of tax credits, with no guarantee of coverage.\u00a0As observers at the time pointed out, \u201caims to cover everyone\u201d was the more popular position. And that was one reason that Obama won the \u201908 election in a landslide. Of course, as we all remember, once he was in the White House in 2009, Obama, as well as the Democrats who ruled Congress with wide majorities, had great difficulty in actually enacting Obamacare. Healthcare reform supporters gather at a rally in September 2009 in New York City. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) In particular, critics focused on Obama\u2019s pledge to reduce healthcare costs; they asked what that would mean for ordinary Americans. Could the feds really cut costs by more than a fifth per family, just by weeding out the proverbial waste, fraud, and abuse? Or would the savings be achieved in darker ways? In fact, one scary answer came from Team Obama itself.\u00a0In July 2009, Peter Singer, a leading academic supporter of the Obama health crusade\u2014by now dubbed \u201cObamacare\u201d\u2014 published a piece in the\u00a0New York Times under the blunt headline, \u201cWhy We Must Ration Health Care.\u201d Thus the \u201cr\u201d word, rationing, was injected into the debate, big time. So now Republican critics were free to offer their own interpretation of what Democrat rationing could mean. The following month, in a landmark Facebook post, Sarah Palin let it rip: The Democrats promise that a government health care system will reduce the cost of health care, but as the economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out, government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost. And who will suffer the most when they ration care?\u00a0The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course.\u00a0The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama\u2019s \u201cdeath panel\u201d so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their \u201clevel of productivity in society,\u201d whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil. Of all the punchy language Palin used, the phrase \u201cdeath panel\u201d was the punchiest. By now, support for national health insurance was falling fast. According to that same Gallup series, support fell to 54 percent in 2009, and to 47 percent in 2010. Indeed, in \u201910, opposition reached 50 percent, meaning that Obamacare was under water by three points\u2014a stunning turnabout. Yet the Democrats were nothing if not determined; the legislation, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, slogged to enactment\u2014and Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010. President Barack Obama signs the healthcare bill in the White House on March 23, 2010. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo) In the meantime, on the right, the Tea Party was in full force. And who can forget the 2010 midterm elections, when Republicans won 63 seats in the House, flipping control of the chamber and making substantial gains everywhere else? By then, KFF was running monthly tracking polls on the specific popularity of the Affordable Care Act, as opposed to the hazier concept of national health insurance. And KFF\u2019s findings weren\u2019t pretty for Obamacare; in January 2011, 50 percent of Americans opposed it, and just 41 percent supported it\u2014that is, a nine-point deficit. Indeed, later that year, Obamacare was as much as 17 points in the hole. Still, the news wasn\u2019t all bad for Obama; he was, after all, reelected comfortably in 2012. And yet, of course, in the 2014 midterms, the Democrats suffered another shellacking, losing the Senate as well. Then came the 2016 elections, in which not only did Trump win, but so did the Republicans in both the House and the Senate. Yet in 2017, something interesting happened: According to KFF, support for the Affordable Care Act started rising. That is, Obamacare went from under water to above water; as of March 2019, support for the program stood at 50 percent, while opposition was just 41 percent. In other words, the program that was once as much as 17 points below the waterline is now nine points above it. So what\u2019s going on? One explanation is that the popular features of Obamacare have starting kicking in. A second, bleaker, explanation is that Trump is so polarizing that if he\u2019s against Obamacare, more Americans will rally in favor of it. And speaking of hardcore Obamacare supporters, Obama himself is still around, making his voice heard.\u00a0In an April 6 speech, the former president looked back and allowed that his signature program hadn\u2019t done everything he wanted, and yet even so, he was proud to have \u201cestablish[ed] the principle that everybody gets health care.\u201d We might pause over those words, established the principle that everybody gets health care. Is Obama correct in his sunny statement? Does that sunniness include guaranteed coverage of those with preexisting conditions? And if so, since Trump says that he agrees on such protection, what might that mean for the forthcoming Trump plan? We\u2019ll take up those questions in the next installment.

      "author": "Warner Todd Huston",
      "content": " In the interview published on Thursday by Hollywood Reporter, Fey reportedly appeared on a podcast with actor David Tennant and told the one-time Dr. Who star that she thinks Saturday Night Live does not really have the power to sway people from their political views. She also lamented today\u2019s political climate that made Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon apologize for having then GOP candidate Donald Trump on his show. \u201cThe culture is so ugly, and the political climate is so ugly,\u201d Fey said. \u201cWe would always have everybody on because you could. You\u2019d have Bush Sr. come do a thing with Dana Carvey before I worked there. It\u2019s so truly ugly now.\u201d Fey told Tennent she felt bad for Fallon who faced a backlash in 2016 for having Trump on his show. \u201cPoor Jimmy. That was sort of business as usual. You wouldn\u2019t think, \u2018Oh, you can\u2019t have a presidential candidate on your talk show,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cBut the world had changed, and he has since very much realized that. It was the beginning of those kinds of things. Like, \u2018I have to really think about the optics of this.'\u201d Fallon ended up apologizing for having Trump on The Tonight Show as critics accusing him of \u201chumanizing\u201d Trump during the 2016 election. But this is the same Tina Fey whose lie that Sarah Palin said \u201cI can see Russia from my house,\u201d went viral damaging the candidate, and the same Tina Fey who did not want to interact with Palin when the Alaska governor eventually appeared on SNL. Indeed, Fey admitted that when Palin finally deigned to appear on Saturday Night Live in an act of good-natured self-ribbing, Fey did not want to appear on screen with her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be in a two-shot with her,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I just thought, \u2018Well, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll show when I die.\u2019 When I die, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll show on the Emmys,\u201d Fey told Tennent. So, while Fey lamented about today\u2019s \u201charsh political climate,\u201d she was one of those who was fostering the same negative climate over ten years ago.

      "author": "Rebecca Mansour",
      "content": " The series, which received mixed reviews and faltering ratings, consisted of prank interviews Cohen conducted in disguise with unsuspecting Republican politicians and activists. \u201cI was surprised, actually, how far people went on camera in\u00a0Who Is America?,\u201d the Borat actor told actress Sarah Silverman during an interview she moderated at the Showtime 2019 Emmy \u201cFor Your Consideration\u201d event in Los Angeles on Wednesday. \u201cThe language in politics has moved to a much more extreme and violent level, and that is reflected and exacerbated and amplified on the show,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last time I went undercover was actually doing a movie called\u00a0Bruno, and what I\u2019ve noticed is that the political landscape has become far more extreme. That\u2019s primarily because you have a president who is using extreme and racist language, so things that we would have found shocking and would have made a crowd, you know, their mouths open, aghast, in\u00a0Borat\u00a0now are the kind of utterances coming from the most powerful office in the country.\u201d Cohen acknowledged that the genesis of the series was his anger at the results of the 2016 presidential election. \u201cIt was basically for me to just get this anger out my system. So I should really credit Donald Trump as the creator of the show,\u201d he said. Who Is America? generated controversy and condemnation before its premiere when former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin revealed that Cohen lured her into an interview under false pretenses by posing as a disabled U.S. veteran. Palin denounced\u00a0Cohen\u2019s deception as \u201ctruly sick\u201d and explained that she had agreed to the interview \u201c[o]ut of respect for what I was led to believe would be a thoughtful discussion with someone who had served in uniform.\u201d She challenged Cohen and CBS Corp., which owns Showtime, to donate the episode\u2019s profits to \u201ca charitable group that actually respects and supports American Vets.\u201d \u201cMock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want, if that lets you sleep at night, but HOW DARE YOU mock those who have fought and served our country,\u201d Palin said. \u201cHis disguise was basically a caricature of a conservative middle class Trump voter. He was asking her absurd, racist, homophobic, and sexist questions that were all meant to mock Trump voters as a bunch of ignorant and offensive kooks,\u201d a source close to Palin\u00a0told\u00a0Breitbart News. Palin ended up walking out of the interview in disgust at the offensive questions Cohen\u2019s character asked her, a source close to Palin told People. Despite all the buzz it generated, the much-anticipated Palin interview\u00a0never aired. Cohen, who denied Palin\u2019s accusation that he posed as a disabled veteran,\u00a0claimed he decided to scrap all the footage of her headline-generating interview because it \u201cjust wasn\u2019t funny enough.\u201d What Is America?\u00a0wasn\u2019t picked up for a second season, and Cohen explained to Silverman why it would be impossible to do more episodes. \u201cThis type of stuff you would never be able to get past a publicist again. This was most popular in D.C., and this was in the Hill every day because they were people who were actually sometimes losing their jobs,\u201d he said.",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Lewis said: I\u00a0don\u2019t think this president has been helpful. I think he feels at home with what is going on. When he reacted to what was happening in Charlottesville, you know, \u201cGood people on both sides,\u201d I cried. It\u2019s not the America that I dream for, the one I was trying to help set right. It\u2019s not the America we had during the days of President [John F.] Kennedy and Lyndon \u00a0Johnson. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s different. In fact, President Trump had been\u00a0referring to non-violent protesters on both sides of the issue of the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. He specifically excluded neo-Nazis and extremists, whom he said should be \u201ccondemned totally.\u201d Moreover, Trump had delivered a televised statement from the White House the day before. \u201cRacism is evil \u2014 and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,\u201d he said, as CNN noted. Lewis, prompted by Matthews \u2014 who likened him to \u201ca character out of the Bible\u201d \u2014 went on to claim that Trump\u2019s election \u201carrested that movement toward goodness and openness\u201d that had characterized race relations under his predecessors. In fact, a widely-cited Gallup poll shows race relations began to decline during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, in the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin controversy and through the Black Lives Matter movement that followed. In 2010, Lewis was at the center of another alleged racial hoax, when several Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus claimed that Tea Party protesters had shouted the \u201cn-word\u201d at him as he walked through their demonstration on the weekend that Congress was voting on Obamacare. The claim, widely repeated throughout the media and used to malign the Tea Party as racist, was never substantiated. Though Lewis and his colleagues were surrounded by hundreds of video cameras at the time, no video of the alleged incident has ever emerged, despite the late Andrew Breitbart offering to donate $100,000 to the United Negro College Fund in exchange for any video proof of the incident. Lewis, who was infamously beaten during a civil rights march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, has been known to put the heroism of his distinguished past to partisan use. In 2008, Lewis cast Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as racists, likening the Republican presidential ticket to segregationist (Democrat) George Wallace, noting that Wallace \u201ccreated the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans\u201d and warning the Republican candidates were doing the same, without explaining how. McCain had, in fact, just cited Lewis as one of three leaders whom he would consult for advice once elected. In 2018, after McCain\u2019s death, Lewis praised the late senator as a \u201cwarrior for peace.\u201d Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "content": " Joe Biden hearts Democrat segregationists. That is just a fact, a fact that is only coming out now despite his being a public figure for nearly 50 years, despite a public record of his love for Democrat segregationists having been available to the media for just as long. In fact, until a couple of days ago, Biden was so sure the media would not criticize him, so used to getting a pass on his love for Democrat racists, he was still running around, in this, the year of our Lord 2019, bragging about how much it meant top him to be called \u201cson\u201d (instead of \u201cboy) by a racist Democrat. Yep, sure sounds to me like Slow Joe, who turns 147 next year, misses the good ole\u2019 boy days when a white man could feel superior to a black \u201cboy\u201d based on nothing more than skin color. But look at everything we are learning\u2026 now. Look at everything our fake news media chose not to tell us in 2008 when Biden was running for vice president \u2014 and don\u2019t forget we are talking about the same fake news media that sent legions of fake journalists to Alaska to find out which library books Biden\u2019s rival, then-Gov. Sarah Palin, checked out. Only now are we learning that in 1975 Biden said his party needed a \u201cliberal George Wallace,\u201d that he believed segregation was a good thing as a \u201cmatter of black pride,\u201d and that he voted to restore the American citizenship of confederate president Jefferson Davis. Did you know that as recently as 1988, Biden praised a Democrat segregationist as a \u00a0\u201cman of character and courage?\u201d All of this is coming to light now for only one reason: the media were not interested in 2008 because in 2008 the media were only interested in protecting Barack Obama. Here is the first black president hooking up with a vice president enamored with segregation and segregationists and the media buried it all \u2014 and did so while attacking Obama\u2019s rivals (Palin, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Donald Trump \u2014 who have no history of BFF\u2019n segregationists) as racists. But now, NOW, now that the media want a far-left extremist to win the 2020 Democrat nomination, now that they want Mean Little Mayor Pete Buttigieg or Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren, now that the media have decided no more old, white guy presidents, they are all over Biden\u2019s racist past. In other words\u2026 Eleven year later, we are just now entering day four of the media vetting Joe Biden. And what we have here is just more proof of what many of us have known for decades, that the establishment media is only a left-wing propaganda machine. If there is no upside for their far-left agenda, the media hide the truth. But if a truth will help move a major political party even further to the left, the media are all but willing to admit they covered up that truth for decades by proclaiming, \u201cHey, look at what we found!\u201d So politicized are the media, they do not care how shameless, corrupt, hypocritical, or fake they look in attempting to destroy Biden with information they have known for decades. All that matters is the agenda. The good news is that the events of the last few days serve as one more nail in the coffin of a dying institution that cannot disappear into the void fast enough.

Palin detailed her experience in her best-selling book Going Rogue. Finally Biden appeared, as usual looking impeccable in his dark suit, tall and confident, his distinguished silver hair flawlessly groomed. I had never met him before, but now I tried to catch his eye, to give him, I don\u2019t know, a friendly nod, a thumbs-up, something to acknowledge that, hey, ultimately we\u2019re all on the same team. Go, U.S.A.! But Senator Biden didn\u2019t make eye contact. Instead he looked past me. His features then hardened into what can only be described as a \u2018game face.\u2019 I could respect that. I knew what it was like to get into a zone before a big game. Then the senator started to stretch. Literally. He put his hands on his hips and, staring grimly at some point behind me, began to bend at the waist, bouncing first to the right, then to the left. Then the neck rolls started, presumably to get rid of all that nasty tension from being the front-runner. After that, the senator from Delaware began stretching his quads, grabbing his dress shoe and pulling it up behind his designer-suited rear end. Right leg, then left. I\u2019m thinking, O-kay. Didn\u2019t know this was going to get physical. It is unclear whether Biden employed this ritual only while debating Palin or whether it\u2019s something he does every time his debates. The former vice president and senator has decades of experience on the debate stage, although he has never been the front-runner in a Democrat primary. Biden faces nine of his 2020 rivals for the Democrat nomination for president on Thursday night\u2019s debate on MSNBC. ",

      "subtitle": "Former Vice President Joe Biden appeared to reverse course on his support for coal at the second Democrat presidential debate, despite having championed a \u201cclean\u201d form of the energy source throughout the early Obama years",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Under attack from Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) at the debate for only proposing \u201cmiddle ground solutions\u201d to climate change, Biden was asked by CNN moderator Dana Bash to clear up his stance on fossil fuels. \u201cJust to clarify, would there be\u00a0any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a\u00a0Biden administration,\u201d Bash asked. It is unclear if Biden understood the question as his answer was far from clear. But he did seem to express support for banning coal and fracking outright. \u201cNo, we would work it out,\u201d the 76-year-old Democrat frontrunner said. \u201cWe would make sure it\u2019s\u00a0eliminated, and no more subsidies\u00a0for either one of those, any fossil fuel.\u201d Biden\u2019s answer, which if accurate, is far more radical than anything he\u2019s previously pronounced on the topic. Earlier this year, the former vice president released a plan to tackle climate change that made no mention of eliminating coal or fracking. It did, however, call for helping communities that are heavily dependent on the coal industry transition to other jobs. Biden\u2019s campaign did not return requests for clarification on his position for this story. The uncertainty surrounding Biden\u2019s position is underscored by the fluctuating stances he has taken on coal over the past two-decades. In 2007, shortly after announcing his second presidenital campaign, Biden was asked during an interview with Bill Maher to rate coal, terrorism, and high fructose corn syrup in terms of which was more likely to kill \u201cyour average American.\u201d Biden, who often touts the fact that he authored the very first climate change bill in the U.S. Senate, responded by ranking coal a higher threat than terrorism. \u201cAir that has too much coal in it, corn syrup next, then a terrorist attack,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is not in any way to diminish the fact that a terrorist attack is real. \u2026 But hundreds of thousands of people die and their lives are shortened because of coal plants, coal-fired plants and because of corn syrup.\u201d Biden echoed a similarly tough line in August 2007,\u00a0telling Grist he did not envision a role for \u201cclean coal\u201d \u2014 a phrase used to describe technological advancements that limit the pollution emitted through the excavation and burning of coal \u2014 if the country became energy independent, as his campaign pledged. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a role for clean coal in energy independence, but I do think there\u2019s a significant role for clean coal in the bigger picture of climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cClean-coal technology is not the route to go in the United States, because we have other, cleaner alternatives.\u201d At the time, Biden elaborated he was willing to invest in the development of \u201cclean coal\u201d provided it was only \u201cfor export.\u201d Biden continued his opposition until he\u00a0was tapped to serve as Barack Obama\u2019s running mate. As Obama had openly embraced \u201cclean coal\u201d while campaigning through Appalachia, Biden quickly adopted his position. The transition was tenuous as Biden found it difficult to shed his old views. In September 2008, while campaigning for the Democrat ticket in Ohio, Biden not only reverted to his old position, but also looped Obama in with him. \u201cWe\u2019re not supporting clean coal,\u201d he\u00a0said when questioned why the duo was supporting the energy source. \u201cGuess what, China is building two every week. Two dirty coal plants. And it\u2019s polluting the United States, it\u2019s causing people to die.\u201d When pushed, Biden added that if coal plants had to exist, they should only be allowed overseas and not \u201chere in America.\u201d \u201cChina is burning three hundred years of bad coal unless we figure out how to clean their coal up,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s going to ruin your lungs and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. No coal plants here in America. Build them, if they\u2019re going to build them over there, make them clean because they\u2019re killing you.\u201d The interaction, which was captured on video, went viral and was quickly incorporated into attacks ads by the Republican presidential ticket, led by the late-Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and former Gov. Sarah Palin (D-AK). In order to downplay the incident and undercut the GOP,\u00a0Obama\u2019s team claimed Biden\u2019s words were taken out of context. \u201cSenator Biden\u2019s point is that China is building coal plants with outdated technology every day, and the United States needs to lead by developing clean coal technologies,\u201d a spokesman for the campaign said at the height of the controversy. After\u00a0the dustup, Biden stuck to the message on clean coal for the rest of the campaign. \u201cBarack and I believe that clean coal is part of our energy future, a necessary part, and also a great export capacity,\u201d he told an audience in West Virginia in October 2008. When Obama and Biden were elected, however, their policies moved increasingly away from \u201cclean coal\u201d and towards the agenda of environmental activists, who wanted to see the energy source eradicated. In 2014, the Obama-Biden administration\u00a0signaled it was siding with the activists by unveiling new EPA regulations meant to cut carbon emissions by more than 30 percent. For miners across the country, the action seemed to confirm that Obama and Biden were serious about waging a \u201cwar on coal,\u201d as many Republican had previously claimed. To show their displeasure,\u00a0nearly a thousand members of the United Mine Workers of America, which endorsed Obama in 2008,\u00a0converged on the EPA building in Washington, D.C. to protest. \u201cWe fought for those progressive causes, and there are people today in the progressive movement who have forgotten us,\u201d one of the union\u2019s leaders said\u00a0at the time. \u201cIf you try to foist this devastation on Appalachia, on our brothers and sisters, we will remember.\u201d Unfortunately, the union was powerless in the face of the federal government. In total, more than 80,000 coal mining jobs were lost during Obama and Biden\u2019s tenure in the White House, the majority of the losses coming from West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The plan Biden proposed on Wednesday would go even further toward killing the few mining jobs that still exist in those states. The irony is that Biden has spent most of his campaign to date painting himself as the only Democrat that can bring states like Pennsylvania and Ohio back into the Democrat column after both went for Presidential Donald Trump in 2016.",

      "content": " Biden told a crowd consisting of union mine workers in the closing days of the 2008 race that he and then-candidate Barack Obama would be better for the coal industry than McCain, the Republican presidential nominee. \u201cLadies and gentleman, John McCain does not believe that clean coal is part of our future,\u201d Biden said before quoting a statement the late-Arizona senator made saying, \u2018in a perfect world we\u2019d like to transition away from coal entirely.\u2019 \u201cThat does not sound like a guy who is attacking us, saying \u2018we\u2019re not for clean coal.'\u201d To \u201creinforce\u201d his argument, Biden added that McCain and his running mate, then-Gov. Sarah Palin, had turned their backs on Appalachia and mineworkers by supporting tax cuts for oil companies \u2014 a move likely to boost petroleum production at the expense of coal. \u201cSo John, if you\u2019re listening,\u201d Biden said. \u201cStop this malarkey about who\u2019s for clean coal. \u2026 Look, Barack and I believe that clean coal is part of our energy future, a necessary part, and also a great export capacity.\u201d Biden proceeded to cite instances where he and Obama had voted to appropriate more funding for clean coal technology, including \u201ccarbon sequestration,\u201d so \u201cwe can use coal more and use it more friendly.\u201d Such technology, he claimed, would help \u201ccreate American jobs\u201d when exported to other countries. \u201cChina is building one coal-fired plant a week, its a dirty plant, they\u2019ve got three hundred years of dirty coal,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe can turn from a liability to an asset, we can actually develop technology \u2026 and export it, create American jobs and help them make the environment \u2026 a lot cleaner. This should be a win-win situation, folks.\u201d  Biden, who up until joining the Democrat ticket as Obama\u2019s running mate had himself claimed there was not \u201cmuch of a role for clean coal in energy independence,\u201d accused McCain and Palin of wanting to send America\u2019s \u201cenergy dollars\u201d to oil-rich nations overseas. \u201cThis is what we should be doing, investing in this technology, instead of pouring our energy dollars into the sands of Saudi Arabia and the pockets of Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be exporting homemade technology \u2026 we should become the engine of change.\u201d At the time of the West Virginia speech, the Democrats were attempting to turn back Republican attacks stemming from a gaffe Biden made in\u00a0 September 2008. In an interaction captured on\u00a0video\u00a0and quickly incorporated into\u00a0attacks ads, Biden was ambushed by an environmentalist while campaigning in Ohio and asked about his and Obama\u2019s support for \u201cclean coal.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not supporting clean coal,\u201d Biden\u00a0said looping Obama, who had campaigned on his support for the energy source during the primaries, in with him. \u201cGuess what, China is building two every week. Two dirty coal plants. And it\u2019s polluting the United States, it\u2019s causing people to die.\u201d When pushed by the environmentalist, Biden admitted that if coal plants had to exist, it was better that they were located anywhere but \u201chere in America.\u201d \u201cChina is burning three hundred years of bad coal unless we figure out how to clean their coal up,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s going to ruin your lungs and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. No coal plants here in America. Build them, if they\u2019re going to build them over there, make them clean because they\u2019re killing you.\u201d The incident quickly became politically controversial, especially as \u201cclean coal\u201d was a top issue the Obama campaign was relying on to court white working-class voters in areas like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and certain sections of the industrial Midwest. The Obama campaign attempted to do damage control by claiming that Biden\u2019s comments were being taken out of context for political points. Afterwards, Biden remained on message throughout the rest of the campaign and even sought out opportunities to go on the offensive against McCain and Palin, as evidenced by his remarks in West Virginia. The moment comes back into the spotlight after last week\u2019s Democrat presidential debate at which Biden implied he was in favor of banning coal and fracking outright if elected in 2020. \u201cWe would make sure it\u2019s\u00a0eliminated, and no more subsidies\u00a0for either one of those, any fossil fuel,\u201d Biden said when asked if there would be any place for fracking and coal in his administration.",

      "author": "Ken Klukowski",
      "content": " \u201cThis case is ultimately about the First Amendment, but the subject matter implicated in this appeal is far less dramatic: rules of procedure and pleading standards,\u201d began the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York, appointed by Bill Clinton, had dismissed Palin\u2019s complaint for failing to state a plausible claim. A three-judge panel of the Second Circuit disagreed, reinstating the lawsuit. The lawsuit arose in the aftermath of depraved Tucson shooter Jared Loughner\u2019s murderous rampage in Tucson in 2011 \u2013 killing six people, including a federal judge, John Roll \u2013 and seriously wounding Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ). Palin\u2019s political committee, SarahPAC, had run ads surrounding Congress\u2019s voting on the Affordable Care Act (aka, \u201cObamacare\u201d), with \u201ca map that superimposed the image of a crosshairs target over certain Democratic congressional districts.\u201d \u201cIn the wake of the Loughner shooting, some speculated that the shooting was connected to the crosshairs map,\u201d the Second Circuit continued. \u201cNo evidence ever emerged to establish the link,\u201d Judge John Walker wrote for the panel. \u201cIn fact, the criminal investigation of Loughner indicated that his animosity toward Representative Giffords had arisen before SarahPAC published the map.\u201d When left-wing fanatic James Hodgkinson opened fire in 2017 in an effort to assassinate Republican congressmen, severely wounding conservative Steve Scalise (R-LA), the New York Times\u00a0ran an editorial citing SarahPAC\u2019s ad from 2011, commented that the \u201clink to political incitement was clear\u201d to the Loughner shooting, then went on to discuss Hodgkinson\u2019s act of domestic terrorism. \u201cThe Times\u00a0faced an immediate backlash for publishing the editorial,\u201d Walker continued, noting that the paper later published a correction which admitted that in fact, \u201cno such link was established.\u201d Palin sued the Times\u00a0for defamation in federal court 12 days after the editorial ran, and the Times\u00a0filed a motion to dismiss the case. The case then \u201ctook an unusual procedural turn,\u201d the New York City-based appeals court observed, when the judge \u201cheld an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss.\u201d Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a district court must generally accept the facts alleged by a plaintiff as true, and cannot dismiss a case for failing to make a claim unless, even if all the claimed facts are true, the law would still be on the side of the defendant. \u201cOn August 29, 2017, the district court, relying on evidence adduced at the hearing, granted the Times\u2019 motion to dismiss,\u201d the panel recounted. The appellate court noted that a district court cannot consider evidence outside a plaintiff\u2019s complaint in a motion to dismiss, and instead must convert that motion to one for summary judgment if the judge wants to decide the case at that stage. However, once a court moves into summary-judgment territory, both sides must have the opportunity to present their evidence and argument. \u201cEven if the plaintiff had been given notice and the court had explicitly converted the motion to one for summary judgment,\u201d the Second Circuit reasoned, \u201cwe would still have to vacate because the district court\u2019s opinion relied on credibility determinations not permissible at any stage before trial.\u201d The Second Circuit concluded that Palin stated a plausible claim of defamation, and must now be given an opportunity to present evidence to make her case. The panel in question was comprised of two Republican-appointed judges and one judge appointed by Barack Obama. The decision in Palin\u2019s favor was unanimous. \u201cThis is \u2013 and always has been \u2013 a case about media accountability,\u201d Palin\u2019s lawyer Libby Locke told Breitbart News. \u201cWe are pleased with the court\u2019s decision, and look forward to starting discovery and ultimately proceeding to trial.\u201d The case is Palin v. New York Times Co., No. 17-3801-cv in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and No. 17-cv-4853 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

But the President makes the deal, and the purchase proves to be one of the most brilliant geopolitical deals in history\u2014a huge boon to American strength and prosperity.",
      "author": "Sarah Palin",
      "content": " Am I describing the 45th President\u2019s effort to buy Greenland from Denmark? Nope, I\u2019m describing the\u00a017th\u00a0President\u2019s successful effort to buy Alaska from Russia in 1867. It was one of the best bargains America ever struck. If President Trump can pull off another deal like that, I say God bless him! Greenland\u2019s vast arctic expanse\u2014which, at over 800,000 square miles, is more than a quarter the size of the U.S. Lower 48\u2014is surely another Alaska in terms of untapped wealth. The media would do well to chill with mocking President Trump and instead learn some U.S. history. Our country\u2019s desire to purchase Greenland predates the purchase of Alaska. Back in 1867, the effort to buy Alaska was the brainchild of then-Secretary of State William Seward, who had originally been appointed to the post by Abraham Lincoln. Under President Lincoln, Seward steered America\u2019s diplomacy during the Civil War, and that experience gave him a deep appreciation of the importance of territory as a source of both wealth and security.\u00a0 He understood that the possession of a given piece of land can be used as a forward military base for the United States, and therefore not as launching pad for a potential foe. Those were the days, after all, when the great powers of the era\u2014Britain, France, Russia, and soon Germany and Japan\u2014were sending their gunboats around the world looking to snap up colonies.\u00a0 So as a simple matter of self-defense, the United States had little choice but to muscle up geographically. With that in mind, Seward\u2019s first idea was to purchase \u2026\u00a0Greenland. That\u2019s right, he pursued Greenland\u00a0first. But the Danes wouldn\u2019t sell. Seward also wanted to buy islands in the Caribbean from, again, Denmark. And once again, the Danes wouldn\u2019t sell, although in that instance the sale finally did go through in 1917, and that\u2019s how Uncle Sam came to own the U.S. Virgin Islands. In the meantime, Seward kept searching. Seeking the most strategic location and vast natural resources, he cast his eye on the beautiful territory that would become our Last Frontier, Alaska. The Russians had been here\u2014where I stand today\u2014for centuries, easily hopping across the 50-mile-wide Bering Strait from Siberia to \u201cRussian America.\u201d (And,\u00a0yes, that body of water is so narrow you really can stand in Alaska and actually see Russia. So Tina Fey can suck it.) The Russians weren\u2019t smart enough to do much with Alaska beyond over-whaling and over-hunting.\u00a0 So when Seward offered the Tsar two-cents an acre\u2014$7.2 million for the whole kit and caboodle\u2014the art of this deal created a bigger, better, safer, and richer America. Of course, then as now, the critics did what they always do\u2014huddle up, sit on their heinies, and\u00a0criticize.\u00a0 The Alaska purchase was lampooned as \u201cSeward\u2019s Folly\u201d and \u201cSeward\u2019s Ice Box.\u201d But Alaska wasn\u2019t an \u201cice box\u201d\u2014it was an absolute gold mine \u2026\u00a0literally. The critics stopped laughing in 1896 when gold was discovered in the Yukon, and soon the Klondike Gold Rush established Alaska as a major magnet. The rich veins even attracted a young German immigrant named Frederick Trump\u2014President Trump\u2019s grandfather\u2014who struck it rich up north and later settled in New York City. Perhaps the Trumps have\u00a0always had their eye on valuable \u201cglacierfront\u201d real estate. Today, Alaska is home to more than 700,000 hardy Americans, generating an annual economic output of around $50 billion. \u00a0Seward\u2019s \u201cfolly\u201d really is Seward\u2019s windfall. Now let\u2019s go back to the place Seward eyed first. Greenland is economically valuable because of its immense natural resources. Aside from\u00a0yuge\u00a0oil and gas development possibilities and enormously rich fisheries, Greenland has iron ore, lead, zinc, gold, and uranium. But perhaps most importantly, the arctic region, and Greenland in particular, is full of rare earth elements, a crucial material necessary for manufacturing just about everything from computer chips to fiber optics to missiles to tanks and you name it. We need rare earth elements to sustain our manufacturing sector and equip our military. And, as shocking as it is to say this, our country is currently dangerously dependent on China to supply our rare earth metals. Since when is it a good idea to be totally dependent on your strategic enemy for an essential resource? China knows they have us over a barrel on this. In fact, as Breitbart\u2019s John Carney reported last May, Beijing has threatened to \u201cweaponize\u201d our dependence on their rare earths as leverage against us in their trade fight. So, is it any wonder that China also has eyes on Greenland? In fact, China already has a large commercial presence there, as they\u2019ve been scooping up rare earth mining rights. No doubt they would love to get control over\u00a0all\u00a0of its resources. They are quite open about their\u00a0plans to make Greenland a key part of what they call their \u201cPolar Silk Road.\u201d They\u2019re eagerly offering to build international airports, which, of course, they will control. China understands that Greenland is strategically\u00a0vital. Up there at the top of the world, it has a commanding position on the Arctic Ocean, not far from Russia. \u00a0I, and others, predict the Arctic Ocean will become a\u00a0key\u00a0international seaway, with an incalculable advantage going to Greenland. It\u2019s precisely because of Greenland\u2019s strategic location that we put our northernmost military base there. The Thule Air Force base is crucial to our nation\u2019s missile defense system. Again, is it any wonder why China is so eager to get a foothold in Greenland? As William Seward knew when he purchased Alaska from the Russians, controlling a strategic location allows the United States to establish a forward base and prevent our enemies from doing the same. So, as a matter of national security as well as economic prosperity, it makes sense for the United States to have a strong footprint in Greenland. So, go for it, Mr. President. America can help Make Greenland Great Again! And a Trump Tower up there could be very cool. Sarah Palin is the former governor of Alaska and the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee.",

      "subtitle": "President Donald Trump has arguably been the best friend Jews have ever had in the White House.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Aside from all he has done for Israel \u2014 moving the embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights, ending the awful Iran deal, defunding Palestinian terrorism, leaving the corrupt UN Human Rights Council \u2014 there are also the things he has done specifically for Jews, like pushing the FBI to solve bomb threats against Jewish community centers, something Obama neglected. (The threats had gone on for two years before Trump took office.) The response of many (not all) Jewish Democratic leaders has been to treat Trump like the second coming of Hitler. Jewish institutions like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) defame Trump as a racist, blaming him for extremism that began long before he arrived. Not one elected Democrat, Jewish or otherwise, showed up to the embassy opening in Jerusalem \u2014 or the Israeli embassy\u2019s party in Washington, DC, to celebrate the occasion. They offer only muted criticism of Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, whose hatred of Israel is obsessive and who openly disdain Jews. It is difficult to explain why Jewish Democrats do this, until you realize linking Republicans to Nazis is a partisan tactic that Jewish Democrats use almost\u00a0every time. In 2008, when John McCain chose Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, then-Rep. Robert Wexler (D-FL) tried linking her to Nazis via Pat Buchanan, described as \u201ca Nazi sympathizer with a uniquely atrocious record on Israel.\u201d But Palin never supported Buchanan. The story was fake news to scare Jews. Jewish leaders defended Obama from charges that he was a Muslim, but never defended Palin. In the 2016 campaign, Trump\u2019s opponents \u2014 both Republican and Democrat \u2014 sought to link him to an army of online trolls who trafficked in antisemitic propaganda. Some of those seemed to like Trump because he stood up against the media. But they had a common enemy, not a common cause. Trump denounced the far-right countless times. To those determined to smear him, it was never enough. And Hillary Clinton made it a key attack line in her campaign, falsely claiming that Trump initially refused to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. When Trump took office, Democrats kept up the lies, assisted by the media. They hyped the hoax bomb threats as evidence of a rise in Trump-inspired antisemitism, though the prime culprit was a troubled Jewish-American teen in Israel. They promoted a phony group called the \u201cAnne Frank Center for Mutual Respect,\u201d which exploited the name of the world\u2019s most famous Holocaust victim to denounce Trump as an antisemite to any hack who would listen. They twisted statistics to hide the fact that there was a\u00a0decline\u00a0in ideologically-motivated killings under Trump. Trump became the first sitting president to visit the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism. He opened his first address to Congress by denouncing antisemitism \u2014 and celebrating Black History Month. No matter. When neo-Nazis hijacked a march about a statue in Charlottesville in August 2017, the media told America that Trump had called them \u201cvery fine people,\u201d even though what he actually said was that they \u201cshould be condemned totally.\u201d (The \u201cvery fine people\u201d were the non-violent protesters,\u00a0both left and right, on either side of the statue question.) Not all of that is Jewish Democrats\u2019 fault. They, too, are victims of fake news. But some Jewish Democrats have been telling politically conservative Jews if we support Trump, we are supporting antisemitism, and betraying our people. (When Obama ran for president in 2008, liberal Jews like Sarah Silverman told Jews we were racist if we did not vote for him.) Likewise, as Democrats have become more anti-Israel, even tolerating antisemitism in their midst, some Republican Jews have wondered openly whether Jewish liberals have lost a sense of self-preservation. Among Jews, the accusation of \u201cdisloyalty\u201d has, tragically, become common \u2014 on both sides. The most charitable way to explain that is to note that that we are, collectively, anxious about Jewish continuity. But we have different ways of addressing that problem. For some Jews, Jewish continuity is a matter of practicing religious observance, providing Jewish education for our children, and making sure the State of Israel remains strong. We do not live as victims or allow antisemities to define us. We have taken our destiny in our own hands. It is hard work, but worth it. To other Jews, perhaps those less inclined to keeping the Sabbath or visiting Israel, Jewish continuity is less about cultivating our own institutions and more about removing external threats. Rather than stand up for our own faith, some Jews have insisted the public sphere be secularized so that we will not be proselytized by others. Rather than stand up for the civilization we helped to build, many of us champion left-wing causes lest we, too, be swamped by the \u201cwoke\u201d wave. There is altruism there, too \u2014 but there is also a desire to avoid being among the \u201cprivileged.\u201d Still, support for Israel was a consensus view in the American Jewish community until recently, especially because it was easy to point out the many ways Israel conformed to liberal ideals. Israel is a liberal democracy with freedom of speech, religious tolerance, gay rights, transgender soldiers, and so on. What changed, especially after the start of the second\u00a0intifada in 2000, was the global left decided support for Israel was incompatible with support for the struggle of the oppressed. That created a crisis for left-wing Jews \u2014 some of whom, like myself, left the left behind. Even then, support for Israel remained bipartisan for a while. What made Israel a \u201cwedge\u201d issue was not Benjamin Netanyahu or Donald Trump. What made Israel a \u201cwedge\u201d issue was the Democrats\u2019 embrace of anti-Israel policies, thanks largely to President Barack Obama. He sought to create \u201cdistance\u201d with Israel \u2014 with help from former vice president Joe Biden. He also ignored Israeli fears about the nuclear deal with Iran. And on his way out, Obama even allowed the Jewish presence in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City to be declared illegal by the decrepit UN Security Council. The \u201cwedge\u201d has a name: J Street. Obama boosted the new, George Soros-backed organization, whose sole purpose was to support far-left critics of Israel within the Jewish community and create an alternative to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Obama and Soros \u2014 who compared President George W. Bush, too, to Hitler, \u2014 knew that a divided Jewish community would be less capable of backing pro-Israel policies or speaking out against the appeasement of Palestinian terror or the antisemitic Iranian regime. J Street would shatter pro-Israel unity. J Street also had a domestic political purpose, which was to prevent Jews from defecting from the Democratic Party. The organization\u2019s first major action was not directed at Israel, but the Jewish community, pressuring Jewish leaders to disinvite Gov. Palin from a planned rally against Iran in New York in September 2008. Then-Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) was to have spoken, too, but pulled out lest she undermine Obama by appearing with the Alaska governor, at a time when Democrats feared the first female on the Republican ticket might draw women voters to the GOP. Democrat leaders told the organizers of the event, most of whom represented non-profit organizations, that they would be risking their tax-exempt status if they went ahead with Palin alone. Rather than telling those bullies to get lost, the organizers buckled \u2014 \u201cunder heavy pressure from Jewish Democrats,\u201d Politico reported at the time \u2014 \u00a0and disinvited her. J Street celebrated its great \u201cvictory\u201d in shutting up a pro-Israel Republican. Meanwhile, the rally was a failure. It was the beginning of the end of strong support for Israel among Democrats. That was the \u201cwedge.\u201d J Street only grew stronger throughout the course of the Obama administration. It opposed every attempt by Israel to defend itself from Palestinian terrorism, protesting the Gaza wars of 2008-9 and 2014, though even Arab states tacitly backed Israel. When Netanyahu dared to object openly to Obama\u2019s policy on Iran, some Jewish members of Congress chose party over principles, boycotting Netanyahu\u2019s speech rather than hearing criticism of their leader. J Street urged the speech be postponed, reassuring the boycotters that their stance was still somehow \u201cpro-Israel.\u201d Trump has not only repaired relations with Israel, but has earned the love and trust of Israeli Jews. The Netanyahu government even named a town in the Golan Heights after him. Some Jewish Democrats will grudgingly admit he has been good for Israel, but many of those argue that he is just pandering to evangelical Christians who want to convert Jews, or that his pro-Israel stance is a fig leaf for his supposed antisemitism. Those arguing the latter are like critics of Israel who say Israel\u2019s support for LGBT rights is just \u201cpinkwashing\u201d for crimes against Palestinians. Meanwhile, the real antisemites in the Democratic Party go unpunished. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi even appointed Omar to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, despite a long track record of anti-Israel and antisemitic statements. In the months since, she has bent over backwards to protect Omar from any consequences for her words and actions, passing a watered-down resolution that failed to single out antisemitism or to mention Omar by name. Now Democrats are considering action against the U.S. and Israeli ambassadors \u2014 but not against Omar or Tlaib. Trump stands up to Omar, Tlaib, and the rest. For his trouble, he gets little but grief from Jewish Democrats, with rare exceptions like Alan Dershowitz. Were it not for examples like Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, who called Trump a \u201chealer\u201d for reaching out to him after the mass shooting in Poway, California, the image of American Jews would be one of shocking ingratitude. Those who care about antisemitism should consider the impression that ingratitude may leave in the minds of our fellow Americans. Criticize Trump where necessary, but say \u201cthank you.\u201d He\u2019s earned it. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "content": " The Associated Press (AP)\u00a0published a feature on Clinton entitled \u201cDemocrats\u2019 2020 race has a new shadow: Hillary Clinton,\u201d that points out she is different than others who have lost a presidential election: Sitting senators like Democrat John Kerry and Republican John McCain returned quietly to Capitol Hill. Democrat Al Gore became a leading advocate for climate action. McCain\u2019s running mate, Sarah Palin, has made perhaps the biggest recent splash as a conservative media sensation who helped stoke a base that ultimately embraced Trump. A former aide to Clinton in 2016 went as far as to say many people think she deserves to be on the national stage. \u201cThere are people who believe she won \u2014 or should have won,\u201d Karen Finney said in the AP article. Finney said Clinton \u201cis in her own category\u201d and a \u201cglobal figure.\u201d But some people aren\u2019t as thrilled with Clinton\u2019s meddling in the 2020 election, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who didn\u2019t get the Democrat nomination in 2016 but hopes to this election cycle. Sanders shamed Clinton on her recent remarks about Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) being a Russian favorite.  \u201cTulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,\u201d Sanders tweeted on Monday. \u201cPeople can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.\u201d \u201cGabbard retorted by calling Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers \u2026 and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long,\u201d AP reported. Larry Cohen, who is a Sanders supporter, praised and then warned Clinton in the AP report. Hillary \u201cput a lifetime into the Democratic Party. She deserves to be heard,\u201d said Cohen, who is also on the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIn this senior leader role she has \u2026 it\u2019s her job to embrace the range of politics within the party and not polarize within it.\u201d AP reported: Her scuffle with Gabbard and other recent headlines she\u2019s driven demonstrate that the 71-year-old remains a political lightning rod, just as she\u2019s been through much of the last three decades.\u00a0 The dynamics raise questions about how Clinton and her party can best leverage her strengths and navigate her weaknesses through next November. Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, defended his boss in the AP report. \u201cThe short of it is that she\u2019s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but it\u2019s as simple as that. She\u2019s out there telling the truth.\u201d \u201cFinney predicts Clinton \u2018will be out on the trail in 2020,\u2019 if not for the nominee, then for \u2018any of the record number of women who will be running\u2019 for other offices,\u201d AP reported.
