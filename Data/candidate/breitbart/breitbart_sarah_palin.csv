Seeking the most strategic location and vast natural resources, he cast his eye on the beautiful territory that would become our Last Frontier, Alaska. The Russians had been here—where I stand today—for centuries, easily hopping across the 50-mile-wide Bering Strait from Siberia to “Russian America.” (And, yes, that body of water is so narrow you really can stand in Alaska and actually see Russia. So Tina Fey can suck it.) The Russians weren’t smart enough to do much with Alaska beyond over-whaling and over-hunting.  So when Seward offered the Tsar two-cents an acre—$7.2 million for the whole kit and caboodle—the art of this deal created a bigger, better, safer, and richer America."

Gabby Giffords (D-AZ). The Times’ editorial was published on the day that James Hodgkinson shot House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) while he was practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game with his GOP teammates.","","27 Jun 2017","To prove that the Times had “ample facts available that established that there was no connection between Mrs. Palin and Loughner’s crime,” the lawyers point to an article the Times published on January 15, 2011, that “recognized that no direct or clear link between political rhetoric and Loughner’s actions could be claimed.” In addition, the lawyers point out that New York Times columnist Charles Blow once wrote that “the only problem is that there was no evidence then, and even now, that overheated rhetoric from the right had anything to do with the shooting” of Giffords."

The example she cites of the phrase in her National Public Radio interview was even more telling. Warren describes seeing a little girl riding on her father’s shoulders at an anti-Trump so-called “women’s march,” complete with knit pink “pussy hat.” She held a sign emblazoned with that phrase, “fight like a girl,” once so subversive, so apt to unify, but now — in its obviously written-by-her-parents-and-put-in-her-hand guise — so easily dismissed, so calculated to divide, and so utterly unoriginal."

But the President makes the deal, and the purchase proves to be one of the most brilliant geopolitical deals in history—a huge boon to American strength and prosperity.","","22 Aug 2019","Now let’s go back to the place Seward eyed first. Greenland is economically valuable because of its immense natural resources. Aside from yuge oil and gas development possibilities and enormously rich fisheries, Greenland has iron ore, lead, zinc, gold, and uranium. But perhaps most importantly, the arctic region, and Greenland in particular, is full of rare earth elements, a crucial material necessary for manufacturing just about everything from computer chips to fiber optics to missiles to tanks and you name it. We need rare earth elements to sustain our manufacturing sector and equip our military. And, as shocking as it is to say this, our country is currently dangerously dependent on China to supply our rare earth metals. Since when is it a good idea to be totally dependent on your strategic enemy for an essential resource? China knows they have us over a barrel on this. In fact, as Breitbart’s John Carney reported last May, Beijing has threatened to “weaponize” our dependence on their rare earths as leverage against us in their trade fight."
