I was a career prosecutor since I was in my early 20s, starting in misdemeanor court with traffic offenses,” Bondi said. “Let’s take it even one step down: If you got a ticket for allegedly running a stop sign, allegedly rolling through a stop sign and not coming to a complete stop, and you challenged that in court—that’s a civil infraction, it’s not even criminal—you would be afforded more rights than they have given the president of the United States of America.

The aide was released and the meeting happened.” Now, you could look this up because I understand that the White House is all about making facts slippery, but both of those things happened. The aide was released and the meeting happened, not in the Oval Office. But the aide was released and the meeting happened after they were caught, after September 9th when the inspector general of the intelligence community came to Congress and said, “There’s this whistleblower complaint.” And the White House, by the way, had seen that complaint.

By massive margins, Independents say that the impeachment issue is “more important to politicians than it is to me” (62% to 22%) and “more important to the media than it is to me” (61% to 23%). It is hard to read this as anything but a warning to the Democratic leadership and candidates: Stop talking about issues that matter to you, not to me. Impeachment proceedings are viewed as bread and circuses for the anti-Trump crowd in Washington and the media—or, as Stanford political science professor Morris Fiorina described it to me, “entertainment and confirmation.” That’s a dangerous perception as Democrats approach one of the most consequential and fraught elections of our times."
