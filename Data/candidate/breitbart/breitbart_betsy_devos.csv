Congress was always considered at that time to be something that was unattainable for the Republican Party,” Schlapp said. “Yes, we got the Senate under Reagan but we never got the House and that was deemed something that just would never happen. Reagan showed us we could win the White House with a conservative. Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay and the others showed us that we could actually win the House with conservatives in the 1990s, which allowed us for the first time to actually control the purse strings which was a big step. We had a few years under George W. Bush where we had a congressional majority and the presidency, but the change about Donald Trump is that he captured the nation with a fresh approach. In taking that approach, he started his presidency with a large majority in the House and a more slender majority in the Senate. He started his presidency with a Republican majority in the Senate and in the House. Those congressional majorities were worried about what a President Trump would do. We’ve seen over the course of the last year that although that relationship is fitful at times, it has produced more policy change than we have really ever seen on the Republican side. Then you understand why our thesis is ‘A Time for Action.’ We’re not longer just sitting back talking about ‘what if this happens?’ It is happening, and everybody needs to wake up and realize there is a window where we can get more successes.

But, now, people would ask me a year and a half ago: Will he govern as a conservative? And I would always give the answer: Let’s see what he does, let’s see what he does. Well, we’ve had a year now to see what he has done—and, if you look at all the areas of the conservative movement, if you look at the three legs of the stool whether it’s culture and the family, strong national security, or the economy, it’s hard to find anybody who is anything other than enthusiastic about the decisions that are coming from the president.

It is perhaps the most nefarious example of using political power to harm your political opponents that we’ve ever seen. As I’ve said in the past, I actually think Richard Nixon is owed an apology. We all accept this idea that Richard Nixon, Tricky Dick, had done something that really had never been done in our history. But the Obama team has shown, and Bill Clinton showed it before Obama, that it is actually the Democrats who aggressively use their political power to harm their political opponents. Now, I don’t condone anything Richard Nixon did, but I think to get FISA warrants in the way that they got them using the intelligence apparatus to go after your political opponents is something we have to understand and get a hold of because this should never happen. Somebody needs to go to jail over this, and it’s not the people that the New York Times says are in legal trouble. It is the people in the Obama administration that used this sacred power, the ability to look into someone’s personal life and listen to their personal phone calls, in a way that was used to maybe even have an impact on the presidential campaign.

Schools that use hearings can continue to forbid lawyers from speaking and instead, funnel questions for the accuser and other witnesses through the panel (which won’t be required to ask them). More problematically, the regulation’s framing likely will generate strong pressure from accusers’ rights organizations and their political and media allies for colleges to abandon hearings altogether in sexual misconduct cases, and adopt the single-investigator model in their stead.

People who tell us, who title things as ‘free trade,’ are actually ascribing too nice a term to big trade deals that are nothing more than complicated business contracts. What I notice from most people who are free market who are associated with us and involved in politics, is that they actually think Donald Trump is right to say that it’s not free trade if it’s not reciprocal. It’s not free to have a TPP agreement that at the end of the window, Japan’s market is only 10 percent open to products outside Japan. That’s not reciprocal and that’s not free. So, what America has done is it has opened up its market but it has not been able to effectively open up other markets where our entrepreneurs are competing.
