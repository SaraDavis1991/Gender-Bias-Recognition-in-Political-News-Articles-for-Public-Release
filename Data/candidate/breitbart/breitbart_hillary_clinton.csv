I literally wrote and finished the book before any of that stuff even manifested itself,” Trump, Jr., said of Hunter Biden. “They said, ‘Donald Trump, Jr., you’re also the son of a rich guy,’ and I’m like ‘yeah, I am you’re right. And a big part of me is because my dad is who he is, I totally get that.’ I acknowledge that. The difference is we didn’t make our fortune pretending we’re public servants. We did it as business people, we were international business people for decades before we ever got into office and we stopped doing new deals abroad because of it. Hunter Biden did nothing other than get thrown out of the Navy for doing cocaine before his dad became Vice President and all of a sudden he’s magically an international businessman sitting on the board of a company in a language he doesn’t speak in a business he knows nothing about getting 83 grand a month. He’s going over to China where the greatest investors in the world take 10 to 15 years to break in if they can ever get in and five days later he comes back with $1.5 billion after flying over there on Air Force Two with his father. There’s a huge distinction. I recognize we’re both where we are because of our fathers. I just didn’t do it because my dad was pretending to be a public servant and utilizing all of the powers associated with therewith. He’s basically taking a taxpayer-funded subsidy and getting rich because his dad’s writing bills and creating laws and his dad’s helping to run the U.S. I mean, I could never get away with that but for him the media is like ‘oh no kids are off limits.’ It’s amazing, Hunter Biden—who is 50—with drug problems and a total mess and all the corruption and all of this, he’s totally off limits but my younger brother Barron who’s 15, he’s fair game? They can attack him all day long? They can attack Tiffany, who’s in law school at 25 and try to destroy her? I’ve gotten to live through some of this. I’ve been one of the targets. My kids have been targeted. They’ve opened up exploding envelopes at our house. So yeah I’ve got something to write about and it’s really all covered in the book.”"

I’m shocked that there’s not more people who have the guts to actually stand up to this craziness when I see all the people who are like ‘yeah, I agree with him on this one.’ Agreeing and then actually doing something are a little bit different—that’s also sort of why I had to write the book. You can see this stuff, you can disagree with it, but then eventually you have to start acting on it.
