      "content": " Sanders made clear that he had a D- rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA) now, and suggested it will probably drop to an F if he wins the presidency. He said Democrats \u201chave to have the guts to take on the NRA.\u201d He then set forth the gun control plan he will follow if elected to the White House, saying: I will do everything I can not only to take on the NRA, but expand and create universal background checks, do away with the straw man provision, do away with the gun show loophole, and do away with the loopholes that now exist for gun manufacturers who are selling large amounts of weapons into communities that are going to gangs. A couple of points: 1. Straw purchases are already banned. ATF background check form 4473 makes clear the person trying to buy a gun must, in fact, be the actual purchaser in order for the purchase to be approved. 2. California has had universal background checks for over two decades, yet the state continues to catch national attention for high profile shooting after high profile shooting. 3. There is no gun show loophole. Never has been. The majority of sales at gun shows go through an FFL (Federal Firearms License holder). The left\u2019s \u201cgun show loophole\u201d mantra is a way to demonize private gun sales, which were the only kind we had from December 15, 1791\u2013the ratification of the Second Amendment\u2013until Bill Clinton\u2019s 1998 background check gun control bill.

      "author": "Kristina Wong",
      "content": " Asked by Breitbart News about his plan to wipe out student loan debts and what he would say to students who paid for college or decided not to go, Sanders did not address the specific question but said\u00a0Wall Street would pay for free tuition at public colleges and universities. \u201cWell what I\u2019d say is that we\u2019re paying for this program which would make all public colleges and universities and HBCUs tuition-free and cancel all student debt. We do this by a tax on Wall Street speculation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think 11 years ago we bailed out the crooks on Wall Street, it\u2019s appropriate for Wall Street now to help all the working families in this country,\u201d he said. Sanders in July said he would cancel all of the nearly $1.6 trillion of existing student loan debt owed by roughly 45 million Americans as a bailout for millennials and the working class, according to Politico. Sanders\u2019 higher education plan \u2014 canceling debt and free college \u2014 would cost $2.2 trillion. His campaign said the tax on Wall Street speculation would generate more than $2.4 trillion over the next decade. Some moderate Democrats have criticized that proposal, arguing that it would burden the wealthy and middle-class to help the working class, or that it would raise the national debt, which is currently $23 trillion. Before the debate, President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign flew a plane with a banner that read: \u201cSocialism Will Kill Houston\u2019s Economy. Vote Trump 2020!\u201d Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order to eliminate federal student loan debt for disabled veterans, or about $30,000 in debt for about 25,000 eligible disabled veterans.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " A Gravis Marketing poll released last week shows the Vermont senator with a strong lead in the consequential early primary state. It asked 250 Democrat primary voters,\u00a0\u201cIf the New Hampshire 2020 Democratic Presidential Primary were held today, who would you vote for?\u201d Sanders leads the pack with 21 percent support, followed by Joe Biden (D) with 15 percent support, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) with 12 percent. Warren\u2019s failure to capture second place is significant, as she and Sanders share similar far-left ideologies and represent New England states neighboring New Hampshire. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in with eight percent, one point above Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s (D-CA) seven percent support, further signifying the loss of the momentum she sufferred after the first Democrat debate. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) came in with five percent support, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Andrew Yang (D), and Tom Steyer (D) all came in with four percent support. The remaining candidates garnered two percent or less. Eleven percent said they were \u201cuncertain\u201d as to who they would choose. Respondents were polled August 2\u20136. The margin of error is +/- 6.2 percent:  \u201cIt is important to note that Sen. Sanders won the New Hampshire Democratic Primary in 2016,\u201d Gravis Marketing President Doug Kaplan stated. \u201cHowever, it is unlikely that Sen. Sanders will have a repeat of his 2016 performance in the state due to the number of candidates in the race this time,\u201d he added. Sanders\u2019 surge in the Granite State does not appear to be a fluke. The current Real Clear Politics average shows Sanders gaining on Biden, who leads by less than three percent. The socialist senator has been drawing hundreds of people to his events on the campaign trail in New Hampshire,\u00a0calling the president \u201can overt racist, sexist, xenophobic, religious bigot\u201d during\u00a0his stump speeches.",

They were joined by Sanders\u2019 wife, Jane, as well as his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir:  Days later, Ocasio-Cortez defended Sanders\u2019 call to eliminate the existence of billionaires. \u201c\u2018Billionaires should not exist\u2019 does not mean certain people should not exist,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cIt means no person should have a billion dollars.\u201d She added that the \u201cascent of billionaires is a symptom & outcome of an immoral system\u201d:  The freshman lawmaker has yet to officially endorse a Democrat candidate, but she told CNN in May that the Democrat Party needed a candidate who has a \u201ccoherent worldview and logic from which all these policy proposals are coming forward,\u201d and cited both Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA):  Sanders \u2013 who is in third place with 16.8 percent support, as the current Real Clear Politics average indicates \u2013 is recovering from an emergency heart procedure following reports of chest discomfort during a campaign stop on Tuesday.

Late last week the softball game was sold as a game between Sanders\u2019 staffers and the news media. But some media outlets began having cold feet over the idea. CNN and ABC soon pulled out and barred their employees from participating for fear of looking as if they were supporting the Sanders campaign for president, Politico reported. Specifically, the media outlets were concerned about appearing in the game after the Sanders campaign sent out a fundraising email:  The cancellations sent the Sanders campaign scrambling at the last minute to save the event. Sanders has recently joined other Democrat candidates in complaining about the press.

      "author": "Frances Martel",
      "content": " Sanders was responding to a question from moderator Jorge Ramos, a vocal opponent of the Venezuelan regime who Maduro temporarily imprisoned after disliking his questions during an interview for Univisi\u00f3n in February. Ramos questioned why Sanders had failed to condemn Maduro in the past and asked him to clarify in what way his embrace of socialism as a label for his personal ideology differed from the socialism that has brought Venezuelan society to a complete collapse. \u201cAnybody who does what Maduro does is a vicious tyrant,\u201d Sanders responded. \u201cWhat we need is interntional and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela.\u201d \u201cTo equate what goes on in Venezuela with what I believe is extremely unfair,\u201d Sanders protested. Instead, he claimed that the socialism he supported was \u201cwhat goes on in Canada and Scandinavia, guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right.\u201d Under Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s constitution refers to healthcare as a \u201cfundamental social right, an obligation of the state [to provide], as part of the right to life.\u201d Late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez nationalized all hospitals in 2013, the year he died and Maduro took over. Since then, Venezuelan hospitals have suffered enormous shortages in medicine and key medical equipment. As many as 85 percent of pharmacies in Venezuela have no medicine and the country faces chronic shortages of nearly every medicine on the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) list of drugs necessary to run a functional healthcare system. Maduro has repeatedly blocked humanitarian aid shipments from entering the country. In February, the same month Maduro arrested Jorge Ramos for asking about the status of political prisoners under his regime, Sanders told CNN that Venezuela still enjoyed \u201cdemocratic operations,\u201d refusing to call Maduro a dictator. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that the last election was undemocratic, but there are still democratic operations taking place in that country,\u201d Sanders said during a town hall discussion. Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, a Sanders campaign co-chair and mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, refused to condemn the human rights situation in Venezuela during an interview with Jorge Ramos in July. She also attempted to distance Sanders from the \u201csocialist\u201d moniker, saying she did not use it herself because, \u201cespecially for Latinos,\u201d socialism is often equated to \u201cauthoritarianism.\u201d While Sanders called Maduro a \u201ctyrant\u201d on Thursday, Maduro has had kind words for Sanders. In 2016, Maduro condemned the United States as a dictatorship, claiming that the fact that \u201cour revolutionary friend\u201d Sanders did not win the Democratic primary that year was proof that \u201cin the United States, the people do not have social rights.\u201d Follow Frances Martel on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Twitter.",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Sanders spoke just moments after a new Gravis poll suggested that he had taken the lead in what is largely a three-way race in the Granite State, surpassing former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).  Sanders\u2019s line recalled a promise made by then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) a few days before the 2008 election, when he declared that his goal was \u201cfundamentally transforming the United States of America.\u201d The socialist senator from neighboring Vermont told the enthusiastic crowd that while many of his ideas would be labeled as radical, many of them were now being adopted across the country. He cited his proposal, four years ago, to provide free tuition for community college, which he noted many cities and states were now considering. He said that now other candidates were adopting his proposal to cancel all student debt. \u201cIf this campaign is about anything, it\u2019s asking people to ask the simple question of why not \u2014 why can\u2019t we do it? Why was it acceptable for the Congress \u2014 against my vote \u2014 to bail out \u2026 the crooks on Wall Street in 2008? But when it comes to young people today who are struggling \u2026 \u2018Well, we can\u2019t do that, it\u2019s too radical.\u2019 \u201cWhat this campaign is about is asking the American people to consider: why not \u2014 why can\u2019t we do it?\u201d he repeated. Likewise, he said, it should be possible for the U.S. to \u201cguarantee health care as a human right.\u201d Sanders repeated a line he has used at other events, labeling President Donald Trump as a bigot: \u201cI never, ever would have believed that we would have a president who is an overt racist, and a xenophobe, and a sexist.\u201d He also told supporters that his campaign was best-placed to defeat Trump, adding: \u201cWe need to transform the economics of this country and the politics of the country, and we think we are the best campaign to do that as well.\u201d Echoing the slogan of the \u201cOccupy Wall Street\u201d movement, Sanders declared: \u201cIn the end, they are the one percent, and we are the 99 percent, and 99 is a lot bigger than one.\u201d On recent mass shootings, Sanders blamed Republican leaders for stopping gun control legislation: \u201cYou have a Republican Party intimidated by the N.R.A. \u2014 that\u2019s it, end of discussion.\u201d It was just one more example, he said, of a powerful, wealthy special interest group standing in the way of change. One woman asked Sanders about the Trump administration\u2019s recent overhaul of the Endangered Species Act. He replied: \u201cMy God, we are losing specie after specie [sic], it\u2019s a terrible thing.\u201d A left-wing Jewish supporter from Vermont asked Sanders what he would do to end the Israeli \u201coccupation.\u201d He said that the U.S. should use its financial leverage over Israel to oppose its \u201cracism,\u201d though he also said Palestinian leaders were \u201ccorrupt.\u201d He said the U.S. should \u201cuse our clout to bring people together\u201d for peace in the region. Asked what he would do about jobs in the private health insurance industry, Sanders acknowledged there would need to be a \u201ctransition,\u201d and that the focus would be on training people to deliver actual health care, rather than administrative functions: \u201cWe don\u2019t need more people sitting around a desk\u201d evaluating insurance claims, he said. One supporter asked why Sanders had supported Hillary Clinton after a corrupt Democratic nomination process \u2014 what he called \u201cone of the biggest stolen elections in our political history.\u201d Sanders said that he did not see it that way: while the superdelegate system was corrupt, he said, there was a binary choice between Clinton and Trump. Asked why he was not \u201ccalling out\u201d rival Democratic candidates who had borrowed his socialist ideas, Sanders said he was \u201cproud\u201d that his ideas had spread. Joel B.

After commenting on the need for young people to turn out to vote, Sanders addressed her question: Look, I was \u2014 you know, it\u2019s a funny thing. All that I have ever said on this issue is that U.S. foreign policy should be even-handed. That\u2019s all. Even-handed. And that you have to \u2014 we respect Israel, Israel has ever right in the world to live in peace and security, but so do the Palestinian people!

(Applause) So what you have, is a situation \u2014 and by the way, the fault is not all with Israel, you\u2019ve got very poor and corrupt Palestinian leadership \u2014 but what the goal of the United States has got to be, is to bring people in the region together, the Palestinians and the Israelis, to create a kind of workable peace that works for both parties, not just one. And your point is well-taken. The United States government gives a whole lot of money to Israel. And I think we can leverage that money to end some of the racism that we have recently seen in Israel. Sanders did not elaborate on what he meant by \u201cracism.\u201d To many anti-Israel activists and Arab states, the very existence of Israel, and the Zionist ideology of Jewish national self-determination, is by definition racist. Previously, Sanders has referred to the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as \u201cracist.\u201d Sanders has also suggested that he would move the U.S. embassy in Israel back from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Breitbart News reported Sunday evening that a Twitter account linked to the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had been taken down, and included support for socialism and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). The\u00a0Dayton Daily News reported Monday evening that the shooter had left-leaning political opinions and supported gun control. CNN reported Monday evening that the Twitter account had supported Sanders and it had expressed \u201cextreme\u201d left-wing views. In a statement released Tuesday evening, veteran Sanders campaign aide Jeff Weaver said: Anyone who thinks that political change should come from the barrel of a gun is anathema to what Bernie has advocated for decades \u2014 non-violent mass political action. Senator Sanders and our entire campaign are repulsed by the despicable massacres we have witnessed. We asked Donald Trump to condemn white nationalism and anti immigrant [sic] demonization. We are not holding our breath.  President Trump\u2019s statement on Monday from the White House in fact included an explicit denunciation of white supremacy: \u201d In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy.\u00a0 These sinister ideologies must be defeated.\u00a0 Hate has no place in America.\u201d In August 2017, after the Charlottesville riots, President Trump made a similar statement: \u201cRacism is evil. \u00a0And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\u201d He has been critical of illegal aliens, but not immigrants in general. There is no evidence to suggest that Trump inspired the El Paso shooter in any way. In a manifesto posted online that is widely attributed to the shooter, he stated: \u201cMy ideology has not changed for several years. My opinions \u2026 predate Trump and his campaign for president.\u201d Weaver nonetheless implies Trump is somehow responsible. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "subtitle": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) released his plans for a Green New Deal, accompanied by a monstrous $16 trillion price tag.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Sanders calls climate change the\u00a0\u201csingle greatest challenge facing our country,\u201d citing\u00a0\u201cextreme\u201d weather phenomena like floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes, despite the fact that those occurrences have existed since the beginning of time. Sanders even suggests that climate change has a racial element to it, arguing the effects of climate change affect \u201ccommunities of color,\u201d particularly. He warns \u201cimmediate\u201d action is necessary, likening the \u201ccrisis\u201d to the challenges former President Franklin D. Roosevelt faced in the 1940s, leading to the creation of the New Deal. Sanders\u2019 plan promises to effectively reverse the \u201ccrisis\u201d while simultaneously creating 20 million jobs and reaching\u00a0\u201c100 percent renewable energy for electricity and transportation by no later than 2030 and complete decarbonization by at least 2050,\u201d per the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s guidelines. A $16.3 trillion public investment is necessary to make those goals a reality, which falls in line with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who said any viable climate change plan needed to come with a $10 trillion price tag \u2013 at least\u2013 in order to \u201chave a shot.\u201d Sanders says we must \u201cdirectly invest a historic $16.3 trillion public investment toward these efforts, in line with the mobilization of resources made during the New Deal and WWII, but with an explicit choice to include black, indigenous and other minority communities who were systematically excluded in the past.\u201d However, he claims the investment will effectively \u201cpay for itself\u201d over 15 years and that the price of inaction will cost far more, citing experts who say that doing nothing will cost the U.S.\u00a0\u201c$34.5 trillion in economic activity\u201d by 2100. He plans to pay for the $16.3 trillion plan with additional taxes on the fossil\u00a0fuel industry, and he plans to \u201cprosecute and sue\u201d them for the damage ravaged on the planet. Sanders\u2019 exhaustive plan covers virtually every angle of the climate change \u201ccrisis,\u201d from promising to \u201cfully electrify and decarbonize\u201d the transportation sector, to investing $1.12 billion in \u201ctribal land access and extension programs,\u201d to providing \u201coral translation assistance to USDA, FDA, and DOJ offices for non-English speaking farmers,\u201d to pouring $200 billion in the Green Climate Fund: Despite the major shortcomings of the Paris Climate Agreement, one primary reason why the globe was able to come together to sign the Paris Climate Agreement was that major developed nations like the United States finally recognized that they had an outsized role in the creation of the climate crisis, and an outsized obligation to less industrialized nations to help them achieve the same kind of carbon pollution emissions reductions while improving the quality of life in those countries. In order to help countries of the global south with climate adaptation efforts, the U .S . will invest $ 200 billion in the Green Climate Fund for the equitable transfer of renewable technologies, climate adaptation, and assistance in adopting sustainable energies. U.S. leadership can ensure that the developing world secures reliable electricity, reduces poverty and pollution-related fatalities, creates greater net employment, and improves living standards all while reducing greenhouse- gas emissions. Sanders also uses his plan as a pitch to drastically expand existing entitlement programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the\u00a0Low -Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The plan states in part: Energy assistance. While we do not expect energy prices to spike because the federal government is going to weatherize homes, electrify heating, and keep electricity prices stable, we still want to ensure that families are protected during the transition. We will expand the Low -Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) by $ 25 billion to help low-income families pay their heating and cooling bills. Additionally, the program will be expanded to provide 10 percent of program costs for maintenance of new efficient heating and cooling systems and technical assistance for the installation and use of new furnaces, heat pumps, boilers, and other upgrades for the duration of the 10-year transition. Ensure a hunger- free transition. Because the cost of energy and food are so intertwined, we will provide $ 215 . 8 billion for free, universal school meals, including breakfast, lunch and snacks. We will expand the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by $311billion to increase the benefits from the \u201d thrifty plan which provides inadequate benefits to the more generous low-cost food plan, include those with incomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty line, remove punitive work requirements, remove barriers for college students to access SNAP , and ensure are not denied benefits due to past interaction with the criminal justice system . We will also expand the SNAP program and benefits to the people of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa so they are on par with the benefits in the continental United States. \u201cWe need a president who has the courage, the vision, and the record to face down the greed of fossil fuel executives and the billionaire class who stand in the way of climate action,\u201d his plan states. \u201cWe need a president who welcomes their hatred. Bernie will lead our country to enact the Green New Deal and bring the world together to defeat the existential threat of climate change,\u201d it continues. The release of Sanders\u2019 plan comes on the heels of Gov. Jay Inslee\u2019s (D) departure from the presidential race. Inslee was the only candidate to build his entire campaign on the sole issue of climate change. \u201cI have seven grandchildren, and I\u2019m going to be damned if I\u2019m going to leave them a planet that is unhealthy and uninhabitable,\u201d Sanders told the New York Times.",

This type of corporate sponsorship is a corrupting influence and must end if politicians are going to represent the American people,\u201d it adds. The bulk of Sanders\u2019 proposal targets the \u201cinfluence of corporations\u201d at the Democratic National Committee. He pledges a lifetime ban on lobbying for National Party Chairs and Co-Chairs and aims to diminish their influence by banning chairs and co-chairs from working for entities: The presidential hopeful also vows to ban\u00a0donations from both corporations and lobbyists, and calls to \u201cinstitute a lifetime lobbying ban for former members of Congress and senior staffers.\u201d Another facet of Sanders\u2019 plan is to \u201cban advertising during presidential primary debates\u201d due to the \u201coutrageous sums of money\u201d media outlets charge to run ads during debates. Sanders uses CNN as an example: This year\u00a0CNN reportedly required a commitment of $300,000 before a sponsor could buy ad time during the presidential debates, and 30 seconds of air time can cost around $110,000,\u201d Private media outlets are making enormous sums of money during events that are meant to inform the public about their candidates. Furthermore, many of their advertisers have vested interest in who is elected. This type of influence must end. He also calls to end corporate influence on presidential inaugurations, arguing that it is \u201cabsolutely absurd that these entities are allowed to spend enormous sums of money in an attempt to garner favor with the President and Vice President of the United States.\u201d \u201cOur grassroots-funded campaign is proving every single day that you don\u2019t need billionaires and private fundraisers to run for president,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve received more contributions from more individual contributors than any campaign in the history of American politics because we understand the basic reality that you can\u2019t take on a corrupt system if you take its money,\u201d he added. Sanders has raised more than any other Democrat presidential candidate in the third quarter, reporting $25.3 million from 1.4 million individual donations. The average donation was $18.07, according to the Sanders campaign.",

National frontrunner Joe Biden (D) comes in second place with 21 percent support, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) with 17 percent support. The remaining candidates do not come close to the top tier, with Sen.

Warren came in third with 12 percent support, the poll showed. However, a\u00a0CBS News/YouGov Tracker survey released Sunday showed Warren gaining a narrow edge in New Hampshire, besting her counterparts with 27 percent support to Biden\u2019s 26 percent and Sanders\u2019 25 percent:  As Breitbart News reported, there are rumblings that Warren is growing a strong coalition of support in the state, with many undecided delegates reportedly leaning toward Warren. Politico spoke to 100 delegates in New Hampshire and reported that many expressed skepticism on Biden. Politico reported: Dozens of state representatives, party leaders, operatives and volunteers said they weren\u2019t planning to vote for the former vice president in the nomination contest \u2014 and many publicly aired concerns about his age, energy and gender. \u2026 The complaints about Biden from party soldiers often centered on his campaigning skills, and a desire for more diversity in Democratic leadership. Notably, few undecided delegates named Biden when asked who they were leaning toward. \u201cI\u2019m tired of old white guys telling me what to do,\u201d said Rachel Cisto, an uncommitted delegate who is leading toward Warren or Sanders.

Sanders\u2019s proposal, said King, reminded her of the 1973 dystopian science fiction film Soylent Green, in which overpopulation and poverty was addressed through euthanization of the elderly and processing their remains into food. \u201cIn light of the shocking [statements] that we just heard about population control and all of that, cannibalism, many years ago, I watched a movie with Charlton Heston,\u201d recalled King. \u201cIt was called Soylent Green, and they were concerned about population growth and all that and the old people were living too long, so they came up with this delicious wafer that they began to feed the public with, and it turns out that Soylent Green was people, the older people, and they were told that they were going to Nirvana\u2026 and then they processed them and put them in this little green wafer, and I thought about that when I heard this particular report, and I said, \u2018My God, they\u2019re turning us into cannibals.'\u201d LISTEN:\n\n\n\nCNN\u2019s audience and its host, Anderson Cooper, offered no push-back to Sanders\u2019s acceptance of \u201cpopulation control\u201d as a government imperative. Manning reflected, \u201cThe thing that shocked me is that Bernie Sanders can say what he said and essentially justify not just abortion, but essentially homicide, killing people, eliminating excess population, and he could say that, and people didn\u2019t boo him overwhelmingly and say, \u2018No, you don\u2019t get to do that.'\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t blink,\u201d noted King of CNN\u2019s audience\u2019s lack of reaction to Sanders\u2019s \u201cpopulation control\u201d proposal. Manning replied, \u201cThey accepted it out of hand, and it shows you the sickness that exists.\u201d King asked, \u201cDo they even know who\u2019s going to be chosen to be eliminated under such a plan? It might be them. They don\u2019t think. Oh, my God.\u201d Left-wing desires previously withheld from the public are \u201cin your face, now,\u201d added King: \u201cWhat makes him so bold that now he wants to put it out there for everybody to hear? That\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand.\u201d King remarked, \u201cThey kill babies in the womb, and that\u2019s going to be the sick and the elderly, as well.

We don\u2019t want that word to get out, so let\u2019s get some of their ministers on our side, and they can keep the more rebellious ones \u2014 in other words, the ones who can think \u2014 in line.\u2019 So this is not new. It\u2019s been happening for decades and decades, but right now it\u2019s really in our faces. So, what are we going to do about it? You\u2019re doing something. You\u2019re getting it out. You\u2019re getting information out. I\u2019m grateful to be invited to have this conversation with you this evening. So it is racist.\u201d Sterilization measures would be included in \u201cpopulation control\u201d laws, King added. \u201cTheir killing centers are on or near streets named after Martin Luther King Jr.,\u201d said King of Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion centers. \u201cThey\u2019re in the African-American communities saying, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re helping the underserved.\u2019 Well you\u2019re helping by killing the underserved? How is killing somebody going to serve them? Frank Pavone of Priests for Life said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to know the difference between serving the public and killing the public.'\u201d \u201cBabies, sick, and old people, in that order,\u201d King concluded. \u201cIf somebody\u2019s sick, we have too many people, anyway. Don\u2019t really try to treat him, just let him die comfortably. Euthanize him. Somebody\u2019s old? Well, put them on the lower end of the healthcare providers. Babies in the womb? Well, we don\u2019t know when they\u2019re human.\u201d Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

      "content": " \u201cIn the United States of America, your financial life and future should not be destroyed because you or a member of your family gets sick,\u201d Sanders said in a statement, calling it \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \u201cI am sick and tired of seeing over 500,000 Americans declare bankruptcy each year because they cannot pay off the outrageous cost of a medical emergency or a hospital stay,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn the wealthiest country in the history of the world, 42 percent of Americans should not be losing their entire life savings two years after being diagnosed with cancer,\u201d he added. That is why, Sanders said, his administration will erase $81 billion in existing medical debt across the board. Via The Hill: Sanders\u2019s plan would cancel $81 billion in existing past-due medical debt, repeal parts of the 2005 Bankruptcy reform bill and ensure that unpaid medical bills do not impact one\u2019s credit score. Sanders has hit the 2005 bill for eliminating \u201cfundamental consumer protections,\u201d accusing the bill of making it difficult for Americans to pay back medical debt by imposing stringent means tests. \u201cIt is nothing less than barbaric that the leading cause of bankruptcy in America is medical debt,\u201d Sanders echoed in a tweet. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t spend all their money on luxury items. Their crime was that they got sick. We are going to cancel all $81 billion in existing past-due medical debt,\u201d he promised.  This is not the first time Sanders has promised to erase debt across the board. He also proposed to cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt via the College For All Act, which would cost roughly $2 trillion. That is in addition to his $16 trillion Green New Deal proposal and his plans to implement Medicare for All, which could cost\u00a0 the U.S. anywhere from $32 trillion to $60 trillion over the next decade alone.",

Our views on the issues are pretty similar,\u201d Sanders wrote in a tweet, along with the interview.  Sanders described Trump as an \u201covert racist\u201d right off the bat, and Cardi B seemed to agree. \u201cI\u2019m trying to advocate the youth in my community because I feel like there\u2019s a serious problem right now in America. We have this bully as a president, and the only way to take them out is somebody winning,\u201d Cardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Almanzar, said. \u201cYou know, we got to get rid of Donald Trump obviously because Donald Trump is an overt racist,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe\u2019s way out there.\u201d \u201cBut right now people are just not scared to show it,\u201d the rapper agreed, pivoting the conversation to \u201cpolice brutality against black men\u201d and asking Sanders what he would do to change that. \u201cI don\u2019t want people thinking that we\u2019re trying to attack the police. Because let me tell you something, there was this one time that I started to feel like I hate the police, they\u2019re pigs,\u201d Cardi B said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of cops that go in their jobs and they want to protect their people,\u201d she conceded. \u201cSo we need police departments that look like the communities that they serve \u2014 we get rid of a lot of this militarization of the police department, which is a form of intimidating people,\u201d Sanders said. The rap star, who has lamented excessive taxation in the past, asked the socialist senator how he can manage to \u201cwork around\u201d voters who fear increased taxes. \u201cPeople are just afraid to pay more in taxes than they are already paying, so how do you think we work around that?\u201d the Grammy-winner asked. Sanders responded with lines familiar to those who have listened to his stump speeches, arguing that the benefits \u2013 in the form of free government health care \u2013 received will outweigh the additional taxation. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of the people will end up paying less than they\u2019re currently paying in health care. Their taxes will go up but they\u2019re not going to be paying premiums, deductibles, [or] copayments,\u201d he said. Cardi B asked Sanders toward the end of the interview if he would be able to eliminate student debt. He repeated his pledge to make colleges and universities \u201ctuition-free\u201d but did not provide any additional details.",

      "content": " Cenk Uygur of \u201cThe Young Turks\u201d program asked Sanders if Democrats are on the verge of \u201cmaking the same mistake that it did in picking Hillary Clinton, who lost to Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cI fear that it could be, I really do. I fear that you would have a campaign without a lot of energy and excitement,\u201d Sanders replied, according to a Sunday RealClearPolitics transcript. \u201cCould Joe beat Trump? Yeah, I think he could. I\u2019m not saying he can\u2019t. But I think we don\u2019t want to make the same mistake that we made last time. And sometimes this is where the establishment talks to itself.\u201d Sanders also took issue with the establishment\u2019s conventional wisdom that Biden is the Democrat best positioned to win the Rust Belt states, arguing that Biden\u2019s past support for NAFTA, bad trade deals with China, and the Iraq War will turn off a lot of voters in the Midwest who voted for Trump because they liked his economic nationalism and America-first foreign policy. \u201cAnd why do I think we can do a good job in defeating Trump? Because in the issues that Trump beat Hillary Clinton on\u2013trade, you go to the Midwest and say, \u2018I voted for NAFTA, I voted for permanent normalized trade relations with China.\u2019 Which is what Joe Biden did, you think that\u2019s going to resonate terribly well in the Midwest? I don\u2019t think it will. I lead the opposition against those disastrous trade agreements,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou think going around the country and telling people, \u2018I voted for the war in Iraq,\u2019 which is what joe did. Think that\u2019s going to resonate well with people? I don\u2019t think so. It was probably the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country. I led the opposition to the war in Iraq. For those reasons, nationally and especially in the battleground states, we are the campaign that could rally young people, working people, people of color, to win this election.\u201d Sanders then called out Democrats for ignoring the needs of working-class Americans, saying the party needs to understand that getting rid of Trump will not rid the forces that got someone like Trump elected in the first place. \u201cWhat was that? It is because for too long the Democratic establishment has ignored the needs of working people all over this country. People work longer hours for lower wages\u201440 million people living in poverty. The only major country not to guarantee health care to all people as a right,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cA vigorous effort to combat climate change, dealing with criminal justice reform, immigration reform. Those are issues that are not only the major issues facing this country, income and wealth inequality \u2014 how do you not talk about that? We have got to talk about that because it is the right thing to do and it is the way you win an election.\u201d Biden, who is far from where the energy is on the left in today\u2019s party and has not drawn big and enthusiastic crowds at his campaign events, has taken a commanding lead in nearly every state and national poll because Democrats think he is their best candidate against Trump. While kicking off his campaign in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Biden previewed what may become his best and go-to argument as the campaign season heats up, saying that Democrats will have no chance of getting any progressive policies enacted if they first do not beat Trump. \u201cThe first, most important plank in my climate proposal is, beat Trump. Beat Trump, beat Trump,\u201d Biden said. Democrats on the left who support candidates like Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) argue that Biden is not \u201cwoke\u201d enough on a variety of economic and racial justice issues to inspire voters on the left to not only vote for him but to volunteer their time to convince others to do so. Biden\u2019s backers, on the other hand, have been making the case to primary voters that Trump the president will be the best organizing tool for Democrats in 2020.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who, like Sanders, is running on a platform of sweeping liberal change and who has emphasized her role as a female pioneer,\u201d notes the Post. Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0worked as a\u00a0volunteer\u00a0organizer for\u00a0Sanders\u2019s\u00a02016 campaign. The development comes after Sanders said that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he told reporters he may slow his frenetic campaigning pace after a recent heart attack. The Vermont senator backtracked in an interview with NBC News\u00a0just a day after\u00a0indicating that health concerns would force him to change \u201cthe nature\u201d of his campaign, in the short term, at least. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\u201d Sanders told NBC, downplaying the impact of the heat attack, which required him to be rushed to the hospital where he received two stents to clear a clogged artery in his heart. \u201cPeople should think that I had a procedure which hundreds of thousands of people a year have,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cPeople should think that according to the doctors I\u2019m on the way to a full recovery.\u201d The 78-year-old self-described democratic socialist was hospitalized after experiencing chest discomfort while campaigning in Las Vegas last week. His staff initially said the stents were inserted for a blocked artery, revealing only two days later that he had had a heart attack. Sanders told NBC it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to suggest his staff hadn\u2019t been forthright about his condition. He said he was still talking to doctors and trying to understand what was going on.

Are you promising that you will have a job for every single one of those Americans?\u201d asked CNN anchor Erin Burnett. \u201cDamn right we will,\u201d Sanders quickly responded, highlighting his plan to combat climate change as one way to create 20 million additional jobs in the economy. \u201cThese jobs will be good-paying, union jobs with strong benefits and safety standards in steel and auto manufacturing, construction, energy efficiency retrofitting, coding and server farms, and renewable power plants,\u201d according to an outline of Sanders\u2019 \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d plan on his campaign website. \u201cWe will also create millions of jobs in sustainable agriculture, engineering, a reimagined and expanded Civilian Conservation Corp, and preserving our public lands,\u201d the outline continued. Sanders\u2019 climate plan also included nationalizing most of the U.S.\u2019s energy production and drastically reducing carbon emissions. He has acknowledged his plan may cause job losses in the energy industry and promised to provide public assistance to those workers. \u201cWe will guarantee five years of a worker\u2019s current salary, housing assistance, job training, health care, pension support, and priority job placement for any displaced worker, as well as early retirement support for those who choose it or can no longer work,\u201d according to the climate plan. But Sanders had said during the debate that despite these promised jobs for \u201ctens of millions of Americans,\u201d taxes will also have to go up. When Sanders spoke about his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill on Tuesday, he acknowledged that \u201ctaxes will go up.\u201d",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Sanders took to Twitter Friday afternoon and wrote \u201cAbolish the Electoral College\u201d in response to an NBC News analysis that theorized that President Trump could win the presidential election in 2020 and lose the popular vote by five million:  NBC\u2019s analysis points to the population booms in California and Texas. Both states, NBC argues, are at the \u201cheart of Democrats\u2019 geography problem.\u201d NBC News adds: Both behemoths are growing more diverse at a much faster rate than the nation \u2014 owing to booming Asian and Latino populations \u2014 and are trending toward Democrats. Yet neither blue California nor red Texas would play a pivotal role in a close 2020 election, potentially rendering millions of additional Democratic votes useless. A presidential candidate must reach 270 Electoral College votes to win. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016 with 306 Electoral College votes to Clinton\u2019s 232. Following the election results, Clinton\u2019s supporters argued for the abolishment of the Electoral College and pointed to the popular vote, which Clinton \u201cwon\u201d by nearly 2.9 million voters. Proponents of the Electoral College system, however, note that the Founding Fathers set up the Electoral College system as a safeguard against mob rule, preventing densely populated areas \u2013 particularly on the coasts \u2013 from determining the results of presidential elections. The Electoral College essentially gives communities in less populous states a fair, proportional voice in determining the direction of the country. Trump won in 2016, in part, for winning over voters in Rust Belt states, including Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. This is not the first time Sanders has voiced support for abolishing the current system. During an appearance at a town hall hosted by League of United Latin American Citizens last week, Sanders expressed support for abolishing the Electoral College. \u201cIt is hard to defend a system in which we have a president who lost the popular vote by 3 million votes, so the answer is yes,\u201d Sanders said. Other 2020 candidates, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Beto O\u2019Rourke (D), and Pete Buttigieg (D), have expressed support for abolishing the Electoral College as well.",

      "subtitle": "Backers of Bernie Sanders are suing the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for fraud based on last summer\u2019s hacks revealing systemic bias for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary campaign.",
      "author": "Ian Mason",
      "content": " The class-action lawsuit, Wilding v. DNC Services Corp., is underway in federal court in Florida, where it is awaiting a ruling on the DNC\u2019s motion to dismiss heard in April. The plaintiff class, Bernie donors who also gave money to the DNC under the assumption of its impartiality in the 2016 primary contest between Clinton and Sanders. The suit alleges fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and a consumer protection violation. The claims are based on the celebrated leaked emails and memos from the \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d hacks last June. The leaks appear to show direct assistance of Secretary Clinton to the detriment of Senator Sanders. The novel legal theory is based on the donors having been duped by the DNC\u2019s claims of impartiality. Attorney Jared Beck of Beck & Lee Trial Lawyers, the firm representing the class of Bernie supporters, spoke with Breitbart News about the developing case and the surrounding controversies. The entire case\u00a0shot into the public eye when, according to a notice Beck & Lee filed with the court, their office received a call asking for information about the case from a person using a voice-altering device. A quick lookup of the number revealed it was from a number associated with the congressional office of DNC Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-FL). The DNC\u2019s attorney\u2019s quickly denied any knowledge of the incident, claim the number is from an unused office and is possibly the result of number \u201cspoofing\u201d by an outside source. Asked about the call, Beck told Breitbart News: The incident was startling at the time it happened and we are still very puzzled and concerned by it. \u00a0The caller had altered his or her voice to be unrecognizable, and refused to identify themselves.\u00a0 But please understand that this is just one \u00a0in a number of disturbing events that have occurred \u00a0throughout the case \u2026 I have no idea who was behind the call, but according to the Defendants, the matter has been referred to the Capitol Police. As for the case itself, Beck was confident that general common law principles of fraud and misrepresentation could sustain the Bernie-donors\u2019 claim. \u201cIf there is anything \u201cnew,\u201d it is the application of these principles to the sphere of political campaigns,\u201d he said. Beck went on to describe that application as follows: One might view this application as a natural consequence of Citizens United \u2013 an opinion that crystallizes campaign contributions as the quintessential form of American political participation.\u00a0 By equating political participation with financial contribution, Citizens United, by inference, incorporates all of the common-law principles of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, etc. that typically govern in the economic sphere. Americans have a cognizable interest in the transparent and fair conduct of primary campaigns precisely because they, through their campaign contributions, are also financiers of the campaign. Asked to make an analogy to a more traditional case of fraud outside the political realm, Beck compared the DNC\u2019s actions with a \u201cPonzi-scheme,\u201d in which investors buy in based on fraudulent returns that are really just earlier investors: I would think of this as a case against the ultimate political Ponzi scheme. We are used to the concept of Ponzi schemes in the investment world. In my view, the DNC is really no different: it was purporting to be \u201cselling\u201d a fair primary process but in reality was serving as a front for the Hillary Clinton campaign. People lost well over $200 million as a result. Beck told Breitbart News that there bringing the facts of the DNC\u2019s conduct to light: There are two main goals to the litigation: obtaining justice for our clients through whatever legal remedies are available; and having a trial on the issues, so that the public may know the truth of what happened with respect to the 2016 Democratic nominating process. The circumstances by which the DNC leaks came to light, allegedly by hacks by Russian government agents, has been a major public controversy for nearly a year. If the case survives the motion to dismiss, discovery will begin, potentially bringing a trove of new information to light about the DNC\u2019s internal operations and how they came to be the apparent victim of Russian hacking. Beck was optimistic about the prospects for discovery: If we do get to the discovery phase, I think it is safe to say that we expect to find much more evidence of the DNC\u2019s misconduct, with the publicly released material being only the tip of the iceberg.\u00a0 Also, we will be able to place all of the material witnesses under oath and take their depositions.\u00a0 In addition, we will be able to conduct discovery on the question of how the DNC\u2019s internal documents came to be placed into the public domain by Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks, which may ultimately be the most important question of all. It is unclear when the court will rule on the motion to dismiss but Judge\u00a0William Zloch told the parties in April it would \u201ctake some time.\u201d",

      "content": " The socialist senator, who has called Trump no shortage of names (i.e., racist, homophobe, misogynist, idiot) in the past, said on Friday that the president is a \u201cformidable\u201d opponent despite what he believes are gross character flaws. \u201cTrump is a racist, a sexist and a xenophobe. Despite all of that, he will be a very formidable opponent,\u201d Sanders proclaimed. \u201cWe can beat him and we will beat him. But we cannot take anything for granted,\u201d he continued, stressing the importance of voter turnout. \u201cTo win, we have got to create the largest voter turnout in the history of the country,\u201d he added:  Sanders\u2019 call for the \u201clargest voter turnout in the history of the country\u201d follows the emergence of three election models used by Moody\u2019s Analytics, two of which show the president winning by greater margins than 2016. As Breitbart News reported: \u201cUnder the average of the three models, Trump would hold on to key industrial Midwest states and pick up New Hampshire, Virginia and Minnesota,\u201d Moody\u2019s\u00a0said\u00a0in a report detailing the results of its models. Moody\u2019s election forecasts have been very reliable in the past, correctly predicting every election result except 2016. The model undercounted support for Trump because it did not anticipate the increase in voter turnout that shifted the majority vote in crucial states. Importantly, Moody\u2019s models all predict Trump wins even if the economy dips to multiyear lows by the end of 2020 and the stock market crashes 9 percent. In other words, Trump is expected to win despite a falling stock market and a sagging economy. Nonetheless, voter turnout could also play a huge role in the election results. As Breitbart News detailed: If turnout by Democrats and independents voting against Trump is low to average, Trump easily wins under the models. If it climbs to the historical maximum, Trump would lose under the stock market and unemployment models but still win in the pocketbook model.\u201d Sanders will appear at a highly anticipated \u201cBernie\u2019s Back Rally\u201d in New York Saturday afternoon alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore:   ",

You know why that\u2019s a gift?\u201d \u201cWhat has a 78 year old seen? Bernie has seen many of the things we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d the filmmaker said, naming pay raises, pensions, and the defeat of fascism and white supremacy. The Oscar-winner also added that it is the Electoral College \u2014 not Sanders \u2014 that is old and outdated. From there, Michael Moore pivoted to Sanders\u2019 heart attack and dismissed all concerns related to the socialist senator\u2019s health. \u201cNext thing they say,\u201d Moore began \u2014 \u201cthey\u201d being those who tout \u201cfalse\u201d narratives\u201d about Sanders \u2014 \u201cis what about his health?\u201d \u201cHow about we talk about the health of this planet that\u2019s dying. That\u2019s the health I care about,\u201d Moore said before joining the crowd in chanting, \u201cGreen New Deal!\u201d \u201cWhat about the health of the kids in Flint, Michigan,\u201d Moore continued. \u201cWhat about their health? Talk about that on cable news. What about the health of 40 million people who live in poverty?\u201d \u201cThe only heart attack we should be talking about is the one Wall Street is going to have when Bernie Sanders is President of the United States,\u201d he said.",
