      "author": "Ken Klukowski",
      "content": " Christians are being systematically wiped out in Syria and Iraq, along with other religious minorities in parts of the Middle East. Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) and former Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) spearheaded\u00a0the passage of H.R. 390, the Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act of 2018, which the president signed in an Oval Office ceremony. Both congressmen stood with the president as he signed the bill. \u201cThe future of endangered religious and ethnic minorities targeted by IS for genocide, and pluralism in the Middle East, will depend on help from the United States,\u201d said Smith. Supreme Knight Carl Anderson represented the Knights of Columbus in the ceremony. This Catholic fraternal order has allocated $20 million to provide relief to Christians and other religious minorities, including $2 million to rebuild Karamles, a town in Iraq that ISIS had destroyed. \u201cWith the legislation signed today, America speaks with bold moral clarity and political unanimity,\u201d said Anderson, adding for historical perspective that this law \u201creminds us of America\u2019s earlier efforts to aid victims of genocide \u2013 Christian communities targeted by Ottomans a century ago and Jewish survivors of Shoah.\u201d The Knights of Columbus is the largest Catholic men\u2019s service organization in the world. President Trump\u2019s representative to the Vatican, Ambassador Callista Gingrich, and Archbishop Bashar Warda of Erbil, Iraq, were also present at the White House.

      "subtitle": "With Democrats on Capitol Hill lunging toward the drastic step of launching impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, Republicans in Washington and around the country are salivating at newly opened political opportunities as a result of the Democrats\u2019 leftward lurch into anti-Trump extremism.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " With zero legislative accomplishments since retaking the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections,\u00a0 after nearly a year filled with contentious investigations, hearings, and the coming opening of a formal impeachment inquiry, Democrats are betting it all on a quixotic mission to try to take out Trump with impeachment. A problem they face is that they need 218 votes to pass articles of impeachment out of the House, and an even-steeper 67-vote threshold in the U.S. Senate to convict and remove the president from office. At this stage, Democrats do not even have 218 votes despite their 235-seat majority\u2013they are somewhere, at best for the pro-impeachment crowd, somewhere around 175 pro-impeachment votes but with growing momentum. In the Senate, there is next to zero chance that 20 Republicans would join all 47 Democrats to vote to convict Trump on impeachment charges. But Democrats, after failing to take on major legislative issues like infrastructure, healthcare, paid family leave, or anything else for that matter, are now pushing forward with opening official impeachment proceedings against Trump.  Down Range with AWR Hawkins.  Sign up today!  The Democrats spent all year conducting hearings and investigations related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, only to fail\u2013as the Special Counsel Robert Mueller probe also failed\u2013to find any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between Trump and his campaign and the Russians. Mueller\u2019s investigation and the Democrat-led investigations also failed to uncover evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump, leaving Democrats empty-handed heading into the August recess back in July. But now, after the emergence of complaints by a supposed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d against Trump with regard to a conversation he had with Ukraine\u2019s newly-elected leader about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the Eastern European NATO ally nation, Democrats have reinvigorated their push for impeachment. They are buoyed by a swelling of support from members in key battleground House districts and renewed energy from top Democrats in leadership, including in particular House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has reportedly told her friends that she views impeachment as inevitable now. It remains unclear exactly what the Democrats would be impeaching Trump for. The content of the supposed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint about Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s new president Volodymyr Zelensky remains private, as does the transcript of the call. The president has said he is considering releasing the call transcript, but has not done so yet\u2013and he expressed concerns that releasing a call transcript could produce a chilling effect among world leaders who wish to have honest and frank conversations with the president of the United States. But on Tuesday afternoon, after news broke that Pelosi was moving forward with impeachment, Trump announced via Twitter he has ordered the release of the call transcript in full:   What\u2019s more, the supposed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d technically does not qualify as a whistleblower under the federal law that provides protection to such individuals, despite the media and leftists referring to the person as such, and the person apparently did not even bear witness to the call itself. Even if Trump did what was alleged, it is unclear how that would amount to an illegal act worthy of impeachment and conviction of a U.S. president, as several Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) have said. Nonetheless, impeachment is less of a legal question and more of a political matter. Polling shows impeaching Trump remains very unpopular nationwide, and with 31 Democrats sitting in districts in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016\u201313 of which he won by more than six percent\u2013with even more than that filling out a broader ring of vulnerable members nearing 50, Democrats could imperil their chances of holding their majority if they go through with this process. To hit the threshold necessary to impeach Trump\u2013218 votes\u2013Pelosi would need to force several self-portrayed \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrats in these approximately 50 battleground districts to support impeachment by voting for it. That prospect, getting these Democrats who go home to the district and campaign on doing things to help their constituents\u2013to actually vote for anti-Trump craze mania has Republicans nationally salivating. Pelosi has held off the left side of her conference all year on impeachment, arguing it would be a perilous political mission that would endanger Democrats and embolden Trump. But with the rise of the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a New York socialist, Pelosi has allowed the growth of these rising leftist forces in her conference all year, to the point where Ocasi0-Cortez has taken the driver\u2019s seat in pushing the party\u2019s agenda, the other side of the Democrat conference be damned. Over the weekend, Ocasio-Cortez ripped Democrats for holding back on impeachment\u2013ginning up the left side of the conference, firing up the Democrat base, and forcing Pelosi into action:   Now that Pelosi has jumped at the behest of the 29-year-old socialist freshman from New York and her fellow \u201cSquad\u201d members Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ocasio-Cortez is ripping Pelosi for only doing a committee\u2013saying she wants instead a straight-up impeachment vote.  The complexity of how to structure impeachment proceedings is meaningless in the broader scheme of things politically, Republicans argue, because now in the GOP\u2019s view the Democrat Party\u2013and all of its members\u2013have officially jumped the shark by going for broke on Trump impeachment, facts be damned. Two supposedly \u201cmoderate\u201d New York Democrats who joined the impeachment brigade this week, Reps. Antonio Delgado (D-NY) and Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), are already under fire back home in their district as Empire State Republicans hammer away at them for siding with the lunacy of Ocasio-Cortez. New York GOP chairman Nick Langworthy said in a statement: By joining the impeachment mob, Antonio Delgado and Sean Patrick Maloney just abandoned their constituents in favor of AOC and the Squad. The radical left\u2019s endless obsession with trying to take out President Trump and derail his agenda will be rejected by the voters who want their representatives to focus on making their lives better, not their own power. This reckless decision will rightfully go down as the one that cost them their seats. They are hardly alone. Two Virginia Democrat freshman women, Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Elaine Luria (D-VA)\u2013both freshman Democrats representing battleground House districts who co-signed an op-ed with five others nationwide in the Washington Post on Monday evening signaling their openness to impeaching Trump\u2013are under fire in Virginia now for abandoning their constituents in favor of impeachment. \u201cBoth Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger were already critically endangered heading into 2020, by publicly joining the left-wing impeachment jihad they are clearly angling for post-Elected office job opportunities,\u201d John Findlay, the executive director of the Virginia Republican Party, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. \u201cThe Republican Party of Virginia already has field staff on the ground this year in preparation for 2020 and will only be expanding our presence as next November approaches.\u201d Another co-signer of their op-ed, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA)\u2013a freshman Democrat who represents Pennsylvania\u2019s sixth congressional district, another battleground\u2013is facing criticism already for siding with the radical efforts to impeach Trump while not delivering on substantive policy matters. \u201cRepresentative Chrissy Houlahan has gone Washington as she continues to prove that she cares more about partisan politics than finding solutions to the challenges we face here in Pennsylvania,\u201d John Emmons, a conservative businessman running for the GOP nomination in Pennsylvania\u2019s sixth district for the shot to take on Houlahan next November, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. \u201cShe\u2019d rather go after the President and try to get onto CNN than get to work for the people of her district. The voters of PA-06 deserve so much better out of their Member of Congress.\u201d Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), a freshman who co-signed the op-ed and represents a battleground district in Colorado after defeating a GOP incumbent in 2018, took a hit in Colorado for signing onto impeachment. \u201cFrom his call for impeachment to his extreme voting record, Jason Crow has put his constituents on the backburner and placed his personal ambitions ahead of the interests of working people,\u201d Colorado GOP spokesman Kyle Kohli told Breitbart News. \u201cColorado\u2019s 6th district won\u2019t forget how Crow sided with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi over them.\u201d In Michigan, one of the op-ed\u2019s cosigners, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and another fellow freshman Democrat, Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI),\u00a0 joined the impeachment charade this week as well\u2013and also are paying for it. Michigan GOP chairwoman Laura Cox said in a statement: Today, Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens decided to join with Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the most radical members of their party by jumping on the impeachment bandwagon. For nearly three years, Democrats and their allies in the media have conducted a witch-hunt against President Trump in an attempt to undo the results of the 2016 election. Time and time again their accusations have been proven false, and I find it shameful that Slotkin and Stevens have chosen to put their political ambitions ahead of the real issues facing their constituents. These are just a taste of the lines of attack Republicans have ready for the Democrats if they continue wallowing deeper into this mess. The extent to which the impeachment fight, along with other national trends heading into next year\u2019s presidential and congressional elections, could affect the outcome of the 2020 elections could be monstrous. \u201cBy pushing for impeachment, Democrats and their allies in the media are making a major strategic mistake,\u201d Andy Surabian, a GOP strategist and former White House official who advises the president\u2019s son Donald Trump, Jr., told Breitbart News. \u201cThey\u2019re literally walking directly into a buzz saw and don\u2019t even seem to realize it.\u201d What\u2019s more, while they draw attention to the Biden-Ukraine corruption questions, Biden continues slipping in the polls in the Democrat primary. Biden\u2019s team has attempted to frame this battle as a sign that Trump is worried about facing the former Vice President head-to-head, while avoiding answering questions about what he did as Vice President in Ukraine in connection with getting a prosecutor investigating a company on whose board his son served fired in exchange for releasing U.S. taxpayer-funded aid and then bragging about it at a public event. But in reality, the intense scrutiny is waking the country\u2013including many Democrat voters who may not have known much about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealing in Ukraine or in China or elsewhere and how much of a liability they could be to his father politically. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)\u2013a leftist socialist rising star on the hard edge of her party far outside the mainstream\u2013has surged past Biden in polling in several states including Iowa, New Hampshire, and California. She is virtually or statistically tied with Biden in a number of national polls as well and has seen her numbers increase even in Biden strongholds like Nevada\u2013leaving South Carolina as basically the only early state refuge for the one-time Democrat frontrunner. If Warren is able to sustain this surge into winning the nomination, while Biden keeps slipping and falling away\u2013all while Trump powers his way through this mess as he has done several times before with other Democrat-driven scandals\u2013the 2020 election could end up becoming a Warren-versus-Trump referendum of socialism-versus-capitalism where the Democrat Party\u2019s new extremist wing takes center stage with no accomplishments to point to since they won the House majority back\u2013all part of why they are going for impeachment in the first place, because they have no other path to beat Trump, some Republicans argue, so they are going for broke with this strategy. \u201cDespite an all-out assault on President Trump, he still has a higher approval rating than Obama did at this point in time,\u201d Steve Guest of the Republican National Committee said. \u201cThis round of baseless calls for impeachment is the Democrats\u2019 acknowledgment of their inability to beat President Trump at the ballot box so they\u2019ll try impeachment instead.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Thirty members of the Iranian opposition, including human rights activists and former political prisoners, have penned an open letter to President-elect Donald Trump in which they\u2019ve expressed their interest in meeting with America\u2019s soon-to-be 45th president.",
      "author": "Adelle Nazarian",
      "content": " The letter to Donald Trump is in part a response to his vows to renegotiate the Iranian nuclear deal and help usher in regime change \u2014 specifically a liberal democratic government. \u201cDuring the presidential campaign, we and millions of Iranians followed your forthright objection to the nuclear agreement reached between the Obama administration and the Islamic Republic of Iran,\u201d the letter notes. \u201cWe sincerely hope that with your election, the new administration and the United States Congress will have the opportunity for the first time to review the regional and international outcomes of that disastrous agreement without any reservations, as was promised to the voters.\u201d Among the requests in the letter are that the Trump administration, \u201cin collaboration with the Congress, should expand the existing sanctions and impose new ones on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Supreme Leader\u2019s financial empire and direct the U.S. Treasury to strongly enforce them.\u201d It also suggests that Trump \u201cform an international coalition to pressure the Islamic Republic of Iran and force the regime to cease its pursuit of long-range ballistic missile.\u201d The letter points out, \u201c[u]nfortunately, Iranians have been among the main victims of the detrimental policies adopted by President Obama in the Middle East.\u201d Signatories of the letter include 10 former political prisoners and four journalists. Perhaps best known is Ahmad Batebi, a former prisoner who was tortured in Iran and who made international headlines in a famous picture showing him holding up a blood-drenched shirt. The image appeared on the cover of The Economist. Last year, Marjan Keypour-Greenblatt, a co-founder of the Alliance for Rights of All Minorities (ARAM), wrote that \u201c[u]nlike many outspoken Iranians living in exile, it is difficult to classify Batebi in the oversimplified taxonomy of \u2018pro\u2019 or \u2018anti\u2019 deal category.\u201d She notes that while \u201c[h]e is vehemently against the regime that restricts freedom of expression and promotes inequality\u2026 he also strongly opposes sanctions that burden the working class and limit social mobility for the poor. Nonetheless, he is skeptical that sanctions relief will benefit the people who desperately need these financial resources.\u201d Amir Fakhravar, a former political prisoner in Iran and Senate Chairman of the National Iranian Congress\u00a0said in a statement issued exclusively to Breitbart News: \u201cWe urge the Trump administration to reverse the Obama policy of subsidizing the activities of the Khamenei regime \u2013 the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism. We believe that stringent Iran oil and central bank sanctions legislation should again be passed by Congress and signed by President Trump as soon as possible. The National Iranian Congress pursued a relentless and successful campaign from 2006 to 2012 urging the U.S. Congress to implement these sanctions in the first place. Sanctions would be lifted only when free and fair democratic elections are held in Tehran.\u201d Should\u00a0Trump meet with these individuals, and other Iranian activists who are for regime change, his willingness to do so would provide a stark contrast to President Barack Obama\u2019s interactions with the pro-Iran regime lobbyist group NIAC (the National Iranian American Council), led by Trita Parsi. Even fellow Democrats have criticized the Obama administration\u2019s Iran policy. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), the highest ranking\u00a0Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has stated that the Obama administration\u2019s rhetoric on Iran sounded \u201clike talking points that come straight out of Tehran.\u201d While a sign that the Iranian dissident community is seeking closer ties to the incoming Trump administration,\u00a0Friday\u2019s letter has also shed light on divisions within the ranks of Iranian dissidents. The opposition movement\u2019s ranks include Monarchists, Liberals, and many in between. Reza Parchizadeh, a political theorist, analyst, and Iranian dissident, told Breitbart News exclusively that while he agreed the letter\u2019s intent was good,\u00a0he believed it could have been executed more efficiently\u00a0and should have included a larger number of Iranian dissidents. I believe the subject of the letter was apt. Indeed I, myself, had taken a similar stance around a month ago. We Iranian liberal democrats trace our intellectual roots to Western classical liberalism, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom. As such, it is only natural for us to want to have a constructive dialogue with our brothers and sisters in the West. However, the one thing I did not approve of about this letter was that it had not been sent to a greater number of Iranian dissidents to be signed. That\u2019s why the Iranian regime is now trying to diminish the position stated in the letter by producing state-engineered letters with many signatures that go against the original letter sent to President-elect Trump. Although the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) did not sign the letter, they are so far\u00a0the most well-organized Iranian opposition group to the Iranian regime (collectively referred to as Jomhouri-e-Islami) and have garnered support from advisors to Trump such as Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani, and John Bolton. Tehran has classified NCRI, also known as MEK, as terrorists. Some Iranian ex-pats find issue with the group. The MEK renounced violence in 2001. In 2012, the State Department, under Hillary Clinton, delisted them as a terrorist organization. They were initially placed on the list under President Bill Clinton in 1997, a move that some suggested was an attempt to garner favor with the Iranian regime. MEK was credited with revealing Iran\u2019s nuclear program in 2002. Slater Bakhtavar, another Iranian dissident, an attorney, and author of Iran: The Green Movement,\u00a0took to\u00a0Facebook to vent his frustrations: \u201cThe Iranian dissidents who wrote President-elect Trump do not represent us as a group and should not be given the chance to meet with our President-elect without us being present.\u201d NOTE: This piece has been updated to include a quote from Iranian dissident and author, Amir-Abbas Fakhravar.

      "subtitle": "President Donald Trump is not happy that former House Speaker Paul Ryan blocked subpoenas of people and entities Trump thinks the House GOP should have been investigating during the first two years of his administration.",
      "author": "Alexander Marlow, Matthew Boyle, Amanda House, and Charlie Spiering",
      "content": " Trump told Breitbart News in an exclusive lengthy Oval Office interview that Ryan blocked issuance of subpoenas to people he thinks should have been investigated on the political left, and now that the Republicans no longer have the majority in the House, people Trump says Ryan protected may have gotten away with whatever they did that warranted investigation. Trump said that House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) and his predecessor and fellow conservative Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) wanted to be tougher with the left, but that Ryan would not let them. \u201cPaul Ryan wouldn\u2019t give the right to have any subpoenas,\u201d Trump told Breitbart News. \u201cOkay? Now in all fairness, Meadows and Jordan and all these guys, they wanted to go tougher, but they weren\u2019t allowed to by leadership.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments came in a wider part of the conversation about how the left is more \u201cvicious\u201d than the right\u2014and that the left in American politics plays \u201ccuter and tougher.\u201d \u201cSo here\u2019s the thing\u2014it\u2019s so terrible what\u2019s happening,\u201d Trump said when asked by Breitbart News Deputy Political Editor Amanda House about his anticipated executive order on campus free speech. \u201cYou know, the left plays a tougher game, it\u2019s very funny. I actually think that the people on the right are tougher, but they don\u2019t play it tougher. Okay? I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump \u2013 I have the tough people, but they don\u2019t play it tough \u2014 until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad. But the left plays it cuter and tougher. Like with all the nonsense that they do in Congress \u2026 with all this invest[igations]\u2014that\u2019s all they want to do is \u2013you know, they do things that are nasty. Republicans never played this.\u201d Trump\u2019s relationship with Ryan during Ryan\u2019s tenure was fraught with peril from the get-go. Ryan only hesitantly backed Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign in 2016 once Trump won the GOP nomination, but then backed off from supporting Trump after the release of the infamous Access Hollywood tape. Ryan ditched on a campaign event he had scheduled with Trump that weekend, and the following week held a conference call with House GOP members in early October 2016 in which he told members it would be acceptable to him if they abandoned the GOP nominee for president just weeks before the 2016 election. \u201cI am not going to defend Donald Trump\u2014not now, not in the future,\u201d Ryan said on the private call, audio of which was obtained by Breitbart News and published in early 2017. Ryan followed through on that and never campaigned with Trump. When Breitbart News published this audio in the spring of 2017, his then-spokesman Brendan Buck claimed that \u201ca lot has happened since then\u201d and argued that Ryan was working with Trump on the president\u2019s agenda in the first couple years of his administration. With the exception of tax cuts, however, which the president led the way on, Ryan did not deliver much in the way of helping Trump achieve any of his agenda during the time Ryan served as Speaker while Trump served as president. Ryan became speaker in 2015, when then-Speaker John Boehner\u2014facing a revolt from within his own GOP ranks\u2014was forced to step aside. Others had sought the job and failed before Ryan eventually ended up running for the position. Prior to being Speaker, Ryan was the failed 2012 vice presidential nominee for the GOP presidential ticket of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. With Ryan at his side, Romney, who has since left Massachusetts behind to move to Utah and now represents Utah in the U.S. Senate, lost the 2012 presidential election to then-President Barack Obama. Then in early 2018, Ryan announced he would not be seeking re-election in the midterms. Critics argued that his not stepping aside hurt the GOP in the midterm elections. Now that Ryan is gone from public life, he took a sharp shot at Trump earlier this week. \u201cThe person who defines that race is going to win the race,\u201d Ryan said about the 2020 presidential race at a lecture in Florida per a local news account. \u201cIf this is about Donald Trump and his personality, he isn\u2019t going to win it.\u201d Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump, Jr., fired back at Ryan on Twitter earlier in the week, saying the former speaker \u201cfailed\u201d in 2012, \u201clied to us,\u201d did not deliver border wall funding he promised previously, and then went on to lose the House GOP its majority in the midterms.  Ryan has since walked back his criticisms of Trump\u2019s 2020 prospects, saying that he meant to blame the media.

Allen added most Democrats in the debate wanted to win over far-left primary voters instead of people in the general election pool who could swing the election later in the season. In his analysis on NBC News, Allen wrote:  For long stretches, it seemed, they completely forgot about the man who has been at the center of pretty much every discussion among Democrats for the last two-plus years \u2014 the man they\u2019re competing to take on next year. The obvious reason: The motivation to beat each other was, on this night, more urgent than defeating Trump. He also said that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) intentionally ignored Trump because \u201che\u2019s an old show that people are getting tired of.\u201d His analysis seemed to strike a chord with others on social media, with some on Twitter mentioning that it was a missed opportunity to attack Trump. Allen later responded with a Thursday afternoon\u00a0tweet saying that Americans should be \u201cshocked\u201d if the focus of the debate shifts to Trump Thursday evening:  MSNBC host Joe Scarborough echoed Allen\u2019s sentiments, saying it was a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d for Democrats to avoid discussing Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden in the first debate:  \u201cOn the first night, they didn\u2019t go after Joe Biden. When you\u2019re sitting with 42-43 percent in the early states and they are not attacking you, that\u2019s an interesting dynamic,\u201d Scarborough said Thursday morning.",

We\u2019re talking about a small number of troops that will move to other bases within Syria,\u201d the official noted, citing 50-100 troops in the region. The White House arranged for an official to brief reporters in a call after Republicans in the foreign policy establishment universally condemned Trump\u2019s decision, announced on Sunday night and promoted on Twitter on Monday morning. \u201cI held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. President Donald Trump was informed of the upcoming operation by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Sunday night, prompting his announcement that he was moving about 50 American operatives away from the potential conflict zone. The official was adamant that Trump\u2019s troop movements were not \u201cgreen lighting\u201d or endorsing the Turkish military campaign against the Kurdish PKK forces. \u201cThe President has made it very clear, publicly and privately, that the United States does not endorse or support any Turkish operation in Northern Syria,\u201d he said.

We\u2019re moving 50 troops within Syria.\u201d",

      "content": " At the press conference, which featured the president alongside Italian President Sergio Mattarella, Karl asked Trump whether he had \u201cany regret for giving [Turkish president Recep Tayyip] Erdogan the green light to invade?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t give him a green light,\u201d the president replied, going on to note that the U.S. had a very small number of soldiers near the border, and that he had written a \u201cvery powerful letter\u201d to Erdogan opposing Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria. \u201cAnd when you ask a question like that, that\u2019s very deceptive, Jon, it\u2019s almost as deceptive as you showing all of the bombings taking place in Syria, and it turned out that the bombing that you showed on television took place in Kentucky. So, you know. And I\u2019m not even sure that ABC apologized for that. But certainly, it was a terrible thing.\u201d \u201cI think ABC owes an apology,\u201d he added. Trump was referring to a story that ABC News ran on Sunday and Monday in which it claimed that t had obtained video footage showing the war in Syria. As Breitbart News noted: The footage, which ABC News purported was of an attack on the border town of Tal Abyad, was aired Sunday on World News Tonight\u00a0and Good Morning America on Monday morning. However, a\u00a0comparison by Gizmodo shows the video was captured at\u00a0Knob Creek Gun Range in West Point, Kentucky back in 2017. The\u00a0Washington Examiner reported that the video footage had been tweeted by a Turkish politician from Erdogan\u2019s party, in celebration of Turkey\u2019s offensive. That footage remains on Twitter:  However, the footage turn out to be from Kentucky:  The\u00a0Examiner noted that ABC News had taken down its video stories, and issued a correction and apology, but that it had not done so on the air as of Tuesday. At the press conference, Karl \u2014 the network\u2019s chief White House correspondent \u2014 continued, without acknowledging the president\u2019s criticism: \u201c[Senator] Lindsey Graham just said of your remarks that you made in the Oval Office that if you keep talking like that, \u201cthis will be disaster worse than Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq.\u201d Trump retorted that \u201cLindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years. \u2026 I want to get out of the Middle East.\u201d He said that Graham should focus on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chairs, and ought to focus on the effort by the FBI and the intelligence agencies to monitor his campaign during the 2016 election. \u201cThe people of South Carolina don\u2019t want us to get into a war with Turkey \u2014 a NATO member \u2014 or with Syria. Let them fight their own wars.\u201d He added: \u201cYou should get your accounts correct. You shouldn\u2019t be showing buildings blowing up in Kentucky and say[ing] it\u2019s Syria, because that really is fake news.\u201d Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "content": " President Macron, Mrs. Macron, and the people of France; to the First Lady of the United States and members of the United States Congress; to distinguished guests, veterans, and my fellow Americans: We are gathered here on Freedom\u2019s Altar. On these shores, on these bluffs, on this day 75 years ago, 10,000 men shed their blood, and thousands sacrificed their lives, for their brothers, for their countries, and for the survival of liberty. Today, we remember those who fell, and we honor all who fought right here in Normandy. They won back this ground for civilization. To more than 170 veterans of the Second World War who join us today: You are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live. You\u2019re the pride of our nation. You are the glory of our republic. And we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. (Applause.) Here with you are over 60 veterans who landed on D-Day. Our debt to you is everlasting. Today, we express our undying gratitude. When you were young, these men enlisted their lives in a Great Crusade \u2014 one of the greatest of all times. Their mission is the story of an epic battle and the ferocious, eternal struggle between good and evil. On the 6th of June, 1944, they joined a liberation force of awesome power and breathtaking scale. After months of planning, the Allies had chosen this ancient coastline to mount their campaign to vanquish the wicked tyranny of the Nazi empire from the face of the Earth. The battle began in the skies above us. In those first tense midnight hours, 1,000 aircraft roared overhead with 17,000 Allied airborne troops preparing to leap into the darkness beyond these trees. Then came dawn. The enemy who had occupied these heights saw the largest naval armada in the history of the world. Just a few miles offshore were 7,000 vessels bearing 130,000 warriors. They were the citizens of free and independent nations, united by their duty to their compatriots and to millions yet unborn. There were the British, whose nobility and fortitude saw them through the worst of Dunkirk and the London Blitz. The full violence of Nazi fury was no match for the full grandeur of British pride. Thank you. (Applause.) There were the Canadians, whose robust sense of honor and loyalty compelled them to take up arms alongside Britain from the very, very beginning. There were the fighting Poles, the tough Norwegians, and the intrepid Aussies. There were the gallant French commandos, soon to be met by thousands of their brave countrymen ready to write a new chapter in the long history of French valor. (Applause.) And, finally, there were the Americans. They came from the farms of a vast heartland, the streets of glowing cities, and the forges of mighty industrial towns. Before the war, many had never ventured beyond their own community. Now they had come to offer their lives half a world from home. This beach, codenamed Omaha, was defended by the Nazis with monstrous firepower, thousands and thousands of mines and spikes driven into the sand, so deeply. It was here that tens of thousands of the Americans came. The GIs who boarded the landing craft that morning knew that they carried on their shoulders not just the pack of a soldier, but the fate of the world. Colonel George Taylor, whose 16th Infantry Regiment would join in the first wave, was asked: What would happen if the Germans stopped right then and there, cold on the beach \u2014 just stopped them? What would happen? This great American replied: \u201cWhy, the 18th Infantry is coming in right behind us. The 26th Infantry will come on too. Then there is the 2nd Infantry Division already afloat. And the 9th Division. And the 2nd Armored. And the 3rd Armored. And all the rest. Maybe the 16th won\u2019t make it, but someone will.\u201d One of those men in Taylor\u2019s 16th Regiment was Army medic Ray Lambert. Ray was only 23, but he had already earned three Purple Hearts and two Silver Stars fighting in North Africa and Sicily, where he and his brother Bill, no longer with us, served side by side. In the early morning hours, the two brothers stood together on the deck of the USS Henrico, before boarding two separate Higgins landing craft. \u201cIf I don\u2019t make it,\u201d Bill said, \u201cplease, please take care of my family.\u201d Ray asked his brother to do the same. Of the 31 men on Ray\u2019s landing craft, only Ray and 6 others made it to the beach. There were only a few of them left. They came to the sector right here below us. \u201cEasy Red\u201d it was called. Again and again, Ray ran back into the water. He dragged out one man after another. He was shot through the arm. His leg was ripped open by shrapnel. His back was broken. He nearly drowned. He had been on the beach for hours, bleeding and saving lives, when he finally lost consciousness. He woke up the next day on a cot beside another badly wounded soldier. He looked over and saw his brother Bill. They made it. They made it. They made it. At 98 years old, Ray is here with us today, with his fourth Purple Heart and his third Silver Star from Omaha. (Applause.) Ray, the free world salutes you. (Applause.) Thank you, Ray. (Applause.) Nearly two hours in, unrelenting fire from these bluffs kept the Americans pinned down on the sand now red with our heroes\u2019 blood. Then, just a few hundred yards from where I\u2019m standing, a breakthrough came. The battle turned, and with it, history. Down on the beach, Captain Joe Dawson, the son of a Texas preacher, led Company G through a minefield to a natural fold in the hillside, still here. Just beyond this path to my right, Captain Dawson snuck beneath an enemy machine gun perch and tossed his grenades. Soon, American troops were charging up \u201cDawson\u2019s Draw.\u201d What a job he did. What bravery he showed. Lieutenant Spalding and the men from Company E moved on to crush the enemy strongpoint on the far side of this cemetery, and stop the slaughter on the beach below. Countless more Americans poured out across this ground all over the countryside. They joined fellow American warriors from Utah beach, and Allies from Juno, Sword, and Gold, along with the airborne and the French patriots. Private First Class Russell Pickett, of the 29th Division\u2019s famed 116th Infantry Regiment, had been wounded in the first wave that landed on Omaha Beach. At a hospital in England, Private Pickett vowed to return to battle. \u201cI\u2019m going to return,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to return.\u201d Six days after D-Day, he rejoined his company. Two thirds had been killed already; many had been wounded, within 15 minutes of the invasion. They\u2019d lost 19 just from small town of Bedford, Virginia, alone. Before long, a grenade left Private Pickett again gravely wounded. So badly wounded. Again, he chose to return. He didn\u2019t care; he had to be here. He was then wounded a third time, and laid unconscious for 12 days. They thought he was gone. They thought he had no chance. Russell Pickett is the last known survivor of the legendary Company A. And, today, believe it or not, he has returned once more to these shores to be with his comrades. Private Pickett, you honor us all with your presence. (Applause.) Tough guy. (Laughter.) By the fourth week of August, Paris was liberated. (Applause.) Some who landed here pushed all the way to the center of Germany. Some threw open the gates of Nazi concentration camps to liberate Jews who had suffered the bottomless horrors of the Holocaust. And some warriors fell on other fields of battle, returning to rest on this soil for eternity. Before this place was consecrated to history, the land was owned by a French farmer, a member of the French resistance. These were great people. These were strong and tough people. His terrified wife waited out D-Day in a nearby house, holding tight to their little baby girl. The next day, a soldier appeared. \u201cI\u2019m an American,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to help.\u201d The French woman was overcome with emotion and cried. Days later, she laid flowers on fresh American graves. Today, her granddaughter, Stefanie, serves as a guide at this cemetery. This week, Stefanie led 92-year-old Marian Wynn of California to see the grave of her brother Don for the very first time. Marian and Stefanie are both with us today. And we thank you for keeping alive the memories of our precious heroes. Thank you. (Applause.) 9,388 young Americans rest beneath the white crosses and Stars of David arrayed on these beautiful grounds. Each one has been adopted by a French family that thinks of him as their own. They come from all over France to look after our boys. They kneel. They cry. They pray. They place flowers. And they never forget. Today, America embraces the French people and thanks you for honoring our beloved dead. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. To all of our friends and partners: Our cherished alliance was forged in the heat of battle, tested in the trials of war, and proven in the blessings of peace. Our bond is unbreakable. From across the Earth, Americans are drawn to this place as though it were a part of our very soul. We come not only because of what they did here. We come because of who they were. They were young men with their entire lives before them. They were husbands who said goodbye to their young brides and took their duty as their fate. They were fathers who would never meet their infant sons and daughters because they had a job to do. And with God as their witness, they were going to get it done. They came wave after wave, without question, without hesitation, and without complaint. More powerful than the strength of American arms was the strength of American hearts. These men ran through the fires of hell moved by a force no weapon could destroy: the fierce patriotism of a free, proud, and sovereign people. (Applause.) They battled not for control and domination, but for liberty, democracy, and self-rule. They pressed on for love in home and country \u2014 the Main Streets, the schoolyards, the churches and neighbors, the families and communities that gave us men such as these. They were sustained by the confidence that America can do anything because we are a noble nation, with a virtuous people, praying to a righteous God. The exceptional might came from a truly exceptional spirit. The abundance of courage came from an abundance of faith. The great deeds of an Army came from the great depths of their love. As they confronted their fate, the Americans and the Allies placed themselves into the palm of God\u2019s hand. The men behind me will tell you that they are just the lucky ones. As one of them recently put it, \u201cAll the heroes are buried here.\u201d But we know what these men did. We knew how brave they were. They came here and saved freedom, and then, they went home and showed us all what freedom is all about. The American sons and daughters who saw us to victory were no less extraordinary in peace. They built families. They built industries. They built a national culture that inspired the entire world. In the decades that followed, America defeated communism, secured civil rights, revolutionized science, launched a man to the moon, and then kept on pushing to new frontiers. And, today, America is stronger than ever before. (Applause.) Seven decades ago, the warriors of D-Day fought a sinister enemy who spoke of a thousand-year empire. In defeating that evil, they left a legacy that will last not only for a thousand years, but for all time \u2014 for as long as the soul knows of duty and honor; for as long as freedom keeps its hold on the human heart. To the men who sit behind me, and to the boys who rest in the field before me, your example will never, ever grow old. (Applause.) Your legend will never tire. Your spirit \u2014 brave, unyielding, and true \u2014 will never die. The blood that they spilled, the tears that they shed, the lives that they gave, the sacrifice that they made, did not just win a battle. It did not just win a war. Those who fought here won a future for our nation. They won the survival of our civilization. And they showed us the way to love, cherish, and defend our way of life for many centuries to come. Today, as we stand together upon this sacred Earth, we pledge that our nations will forever be strong and united. We will forever be together. Our people will forever be bold. Our hearts will forever be loyal. And our children, and their children, will forever and always be free. May God bless our great veterans. May God bless our Allies. May God bless the heroes of D-Day. And may God bless America. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much.",

The eventbrite.com protest notice said it would take place at noon on Monday on the \u201cCapitol lawn below the steps,\u201d but no one showed up for that protest. This protest notice said that \u201cevents are registered with Indivisible,\u201d one of the groups listed as a sponsor for the 11:00 a.m. protest. Breitbart News reached out to the contact for the Indivisible event but did not receive a response. Breitbart News also reached out to MoveOn to ask if the protest was canceled and, if not, were organizers disappointed that no one showed up? Monday was the first day Congress was back in session following its August brea, and both advertised protests said the purpose was to demand lawmakers start an impeachment inquiry against the president. Protest organizers at the eventbrite.com website make these claims against Trump and Vice President Mike Pence: The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors., The charge of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d covers allegations of misconduct by officials, such as perjury of oath, abuse of authority, bribery, intimidation, misuse of assets, failure to supervise, dereliction of duty, unbecoming conduct, refusal to obey a lawful order, chronic intoxication, and tax evasion. The impeachaugust.com website states that Trump has \u201cbroken the law, abused presidential power, and stoked hatred in our country.\u201d Both protest notices state that the rallies will be ongoing with protesters descending on the offices of lawmakers and protesting at members\u2019 town halls across the country throughout the month. The notice for Monday\u2019s protest on the impeachaugust.com website has been removed and only future protests are now posted. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

Trump announced a new ten percent tariff on $300 billion of Chinese goods earlier this month, which will take place later this year. \u201cFor many years China (and many other countries) has been taking advantage of the United States on Trade, Intellectual Property Theft, and much more,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cOur Country has been losing HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year to China, with no end in sight.\u201d In recent months, Trump has urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to make the United States economy more competitive as the trade fight with China continues. After Chairman Jerome Powell did not indicate a change in monetary policy in a speech on Friday, Trump sounded the alarm. \u201cMy only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to the leader of China, Xi Jinping. The president said Friday he would act alone to respond to China, questioning whether Powell was an \u201cenemy\u201d in the trade fight. \u201cWe have a very strong dollar and a very weak Fed. I will work \u2018brilliantly\u2019 with both, and the U.S. will do great,\u201d he wrote. The stock market closed down 623 points on Friday, as the chaotic day unsettled traders. Trump defended his trade battle, noting that the status quo with China allowed the country to enjoy a massive trade disparity under past presidents. \u201cAs President, I can no longer allow this to happen! In the spirit of achieving Fair Trade, we must Balance this very unfair trading Relationship,\u201d he wrote. He described the new China tariffs as \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d suggesting they were trying to punish the American economy ahead of the 2020 election. Trump has repeatedly said that Democrats like former Vice President Joe Biden would likely cave to China if he won the presidency in 2020. \u201cSleepy Joe doesn\u2019t have a clue,\u201d Trump told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cSleepy Joe said, \u2018Oh, China is wonderful.\u2019 Well, China is wonderful for China.

He appeared shocked that Democrats began an impeachment inquiry over a simple phone call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, when he said that the president himself said that he did not feel pressured by Trump. \u201cThe whistleblower said quid pro quo eight times,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was a little off.

Trump spoke about protecting the First Amendment of free speech, the\u00a0Second Amendment, and rebuilding a strong military and the right to free speech. He criticized Democrats running for president for pursuing radical leftist policies without consideration for the right to religious freedom. \u201cSocialism is obsessed with the pursuit of power because it has replaced religion in their lives,\u201d he said. The president received a standing ovation when he reminded them that America stood for freedom of religion and the right to life. \u201cWe\u2019re under assault, very simple,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn America, we don\u2019t worship government, we worship God,\u201d Without naming him, Trump referred to former Rep.

The sentiment attributed to POTUS is inconsistent w/ America\u2019s history and antithetical to American values. May our memory of Dr. King buoy our hope for unity, greatness, & \u2018charity for all.'\u201d  The former Massachusetts governor was referring to allegations that President Trump had referred to \u201cshithole countries\u201d in a negotiation over immigration policy in the Oval Office last Thursday with a small group of Senators that included Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL). Trump has denied using that term, and Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Frank Purdue (R-GA) have denied hearing it, as has Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who was also present. The White House said that President Trump was arguing for a merit-based system of immigration policy, as opposed to the existing policies\u00a0of \u201cchain migration\u201d and the \u201cdiversity visa\u201d lottery.

Democrats have also used the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday to attack Trump, based on the recent controversy and on past claims that he is a racist. Speculation has mounted whether Romney would be a friend or foe of President Trump if elected to the Senate. Romney has a rocky relationship with President Trump. In March 2016, he\u00a0viciously attacked Trump in a speech in Salt Lake City, Utah \u2014 but stopped short of endorsing a rival candidate in the Republican primary. He mended fences with Trump when he aspired to become Secretary of State in the new administration, but has since re-emerged as one of the president\u2019s leading GOP\u00a0critics, appealing to the remnant of the \u201cNeverTrump\u201d movement. Last summer, Romney criticized President Trump\u2019s response to violence in Charlottesville, accusing him of moral equivalence between neo-Nazis and those opposing \u201cracism and bigotry\u201d \u2014 but without noting that the latter had disrupted a lawful, permitted protest. Democrats accused Romney himself of racism when he ran for president in 2012, particularly when he accused Barack Obama\u00a0supporters of voting for \u201cfree stuff,\u201d and when he joked that \u201cno one\u2019s ever asked to see my birth certificate.\u201d Joel B.

James Mattis sat beside him at the table, Trump said,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been speaking with Gen. Mattis. We\u2019re going to be doing things militarily,\u201d adding, \u201cUntil we can have a wall and proper security, we\u2019re going to be guarding our border with the military.\u201d The president did not detail specific plans for policing the border but appeared eager to make it happen after Democrats stalled progress on his long-promised border wall. \u201cThat\u2019s a big step,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe really haven\u2019t done that before, certainly not very much before.\u201d Trump confirmed in an afternoon press conference on Tuesday that he does intend\u00a0to use military force to secure the border. \u201cWe are preparing to have the military to secure our border between Mexico and the United States,\u201d Trump said when reporters questioned him for more details. He said he would be meeting with Mattis and other security officials to discuss the issue soon. The omnibus spending deal included less than $1.6 billion for border structures but an impressive\u00a0$700 billion for the Pentagon in FY2018. In a 2011 interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly on Fox News, Trump signaled interest in using the U.S. military to stop illegal immigration.\u00a0\u201cYou put soldiers on that line,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cDo you have a choice? They are coming over and they are climbing over a fence and there\u2019s nobody within 10 miles.\u201d",
