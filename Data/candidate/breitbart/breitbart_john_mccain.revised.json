      "content": " Tuesday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d network contributor Ana Navarro accused the Trump administration of being irritated Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) is not \u201cdying\u201d of cancer, but instead choosing to live with it by criticizing Trump. \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m dying \u2014 Amy, you\u2019re dying,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cWe are all dying. We just don\u2019t know when. I think, frankly, what\u2019s happening here is the White House is irritated John McCain is not dying of cancer. He\u2019s living with cancer. And he is choosing to make every single day on this earth something that\u2019s meaningful and counts. He is still confronting Trump for his outrages. He is still speaking conscience and conviction and principle.\u201d \u201cHe is reminding Republicans what we used to be,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s very irritating to the White House, I suspect, on this torture issue because McCain speaks with a moral certitude\u00a0that few can, of that of a man that was actually tortured for years \u2014 who has experienced in his own bones and his own skin and has got the scars to show for it. So no, John McCain is not dying with cancer. He is living with cancer. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",

      "subtitle": "NEW YORK \u2014 In his newly released book, Sen. John McCain admits he knew the anti-Trump dossier that he infamously passed to the FBI contained \u201cunproven accusations,\u201d \u201cmostly raw, unverified intelligence\u201d and allegations about which the senator \u201chad no idea\u201d if \u201cany were true.\u201d",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " Yet McCain maintains he had an \u201cobligation\u201d to pass the wild charges against Donald Trump to FBI Director James Comey and he would even do it again. \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t like it can go to hell,\u201d McCain exclaimed. In the book\u00a0The Restless Wave, McCain provides an inside account of how he says he came across the dossier. He writes that he was told about the claims in the document at a security conference in Canada in November 2016, where he was approached by Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow and friend of ex-British spy Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier. McCain wrote that Wood told him Steele \u201chad been commissioned to investigate connections between the Trump campaign and Russian agents as well as potentially compromising information about the President-elect that Putin allegedly possessed.\u201d McCain, however, did not address the obvious question of whether he was told exactly who \u201ccommissioned\u201d Steele to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the alleged Russian ties. The dossier was commissioned by the controversial Fusion GPS opposition research firm, which was paid for its anti-Trump work by Trump\u2019s primary political opponents, namely Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm. McCain goes on to describe Wood as telling him Steele\u2019s work \u201cwas mostly raw, unverified intelligence, but that the author strongly believed merited a thorough examination by counterintelligence experts.\u201d The politician says the dossier claims described to him were \u201ctoo strange a scenario to believe, something out of a le Carr\u00e9 novel, not the kind of thing anyone has ever actually had to worry about with a new President, no matter what other concerns.\u201d Still, McCain says he reasoned that \u201ceven a remote risk that the President of the United States might be vulnerable to Russian extortion had to be investigated.\u201d McCain concedes Wood told him he had not actually read the dossier himself, and writes that he wasn\u2019t sure if he ever met Wood before and couldn\u2019t recall previously having a conversation with Wood. Still, McCain took Wood\u2019s word for it when Wood vouched for Steele\u2019s credibility. \u201cSteele was a respected professional, Wood assured us, who had good Russian contacts and long experience collecting and analyzing intelligence on the Kremlin,\u201d McCain wrote. Present at the meeting with Wood and McCain was David J. Kramer, a former State Department official and longtime McCain associate who agreed to \u201cgo to London to meet Steele, confirm his credibility and report back to me.\u201d McCain doesn\u2019t detail Kramer\u2019s visit to London beyond simply writing, \u201cWhen David returned, and shared his impression that the former spy was, as Sir Andrew had vouched, a respected professional, and not to outward appearances given to hyperbole or hysteria, I agreed to receive a copy of what is now referred to as \u2018the dossier.\u2019\u2019\u2019 McCain leaves out exactly where Kramer obtained his dossier copy. The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported\u00a0in February that Kramer received the dossier directly from Fusion GPS after McCain expressed interest in it. Those details marked the clearest indication that McCain may have known that the dossier originated with Fusion GPS, meaning that he may have knowingly passed on political material to the FBI. Also, in a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0oped\u00a0in January, GPS co-founders Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritch wrote that they helped McCain share their anti-Trump dossier with the Obama-era intelligence community via an unnamed \u201cemissary.\u201d Without mentioning Fusion GPS, McCain goes on to briefly describe turning over the dossier to Comey: The allegations were disturbing, but I had no idea which if any were true. I could not independently verify any of it, and so I did what any American who cares about our nation\u2019s security should have done. I put the dossier in my office safe, called the office of the Director of the FBI Jim Comey and asked for a meeting. I went to see him at his earliest convenience, handed him the dossier, explained how it had come into my possession. I said I didn\u2019t know what to make of it, and I trusted the FBI would examine it carefully and investigate its claims. With that, I thanked the director and left. The entire meeting had probably not lasted longer than ten minutes. I did what duty demanded I do. I don\u2019t know what is true, partially true or not true in the dossier. I gave it to the people best equipped to answer those questions. Had I done any more, I would have exceeded my capability. Had I done any less I would be ashamed of myself. And if any of my colleagues in Congress had been in my situation and not done what I did, I would be ashamed of them. McCain implies he was essentially targeted as an appropriate venue to deliver the dossier to the FBI due to his hawkish views on Putin and Russia: Why had I been given the dossier? That\u2019s the first accusatory question in every budding conspiracy theory about my minor role in the controversy. The answer is too obvious for the paranoid to credit. I am known internationally to be a persistent critic of Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime, and I have been for a long while. Wood and Steele likely assumed that my animosity toward Putin, which I unapologetically acknowledge, ensured that I would take their concerns seriously. They assumed correctly. A few weeks after McCain gave Steele\u2019s dossier to Comey on Dec. 9, 2016, the FBI chief updated then President-Elect Trump and President Obama on the dossier in a classified briefing. As Breitbart News\u00a0documented, Comey\u2019s dossier briefing to Trump was subsequently leaked to the news media, setting in motion a flurry of news media attention on the dossier, including the release of the document to the public. The briefing also may have provided the veneer of respectability to a document that had been circulating for months within the news media but widely considered too unverified to publicize.

      "content": " \u201cOk. I\u2019m truly over it with this mess. First the homophobic posts, then the 9/11 \u2018Truther\u2019 posts, and now this nonsense with manipulating images,\u201d Aiken fumed. \u201cAnd watch @JoyAnnReid blame this on a hacker\u2026 or better yet\u2026 Ambien. It\u2019s time for her to go too.\u201d  In replies to his followers, Aiken said that Reid has \u201clost all credibility.\u201d  BuzzFeed uncovered the post depicting McCain as a mass murderer: The October 2007 post,\u00a0titled \u201cBaghdad John Strikes Again,\u201d discusses then-GOP Presidential nominee John McCain\u2019s infamous claim that he would \u201cfollow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell.\u201d The image appears at the end of the post, which was apparently penned by Reid. The McCain post is the latest in a series of archived items from Reid\u2019s blog that have embarrassed the AM Joy host and her network. Though Reid apologized for several homophobic posts last December, she later attributed others to a hacker. Reid subsequently admitted that she could not substantiate this claim after news reports\u00a0knocked down the evidence\u00a0her private cybersecurity expert provided. Reid and MSNBC\u00a0have both pointed\u00a0to an ongoing FBI investigation into the alleged breach. This development comes one day after Buzzfeed reported the embattled MSNBC host published 9/11 conspiracy theories on her now-defunct blog. In March 2006, Reid published a blog post which promoted a video titled\u00a0Loose Change 9/11, an 80-minute film produced by Infowars founder Alex Jones, that alleges the U.S. government was behind the\u00a0Islamic terror attack\u00a0on the\u00a0twin towers\u00a0of the\u00a0World Trade Center. In December, the MSNBC host apologized\u00a0for publishing homophobic remarks about former Flordia Gov. Charlie Crist, in which she called the Republican-turned-Democrat\u00a0\u201cMiss Charlie.\u201d In another post, Joy wrote \u201cStop pretending, brother,\u201d later adding,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay that you don\u2019t go for the ladies.\u201d    \u201cThis note is my apology to all who are disappointed by the content of blogs I wrote a decade ago, for which my choice of words and tone have legitimately been criticized. As a writer, I pride myself on a facility with language\u2014an economy of words or at least some wisdom in the selection,\u201d Reid\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement\u00a0published by The Wrap. \u201cHowever, that clearly has not always been the case,\u201d she added. In late April, a progressive Twitter user found more anti-gay posts from the Reid Report, but Reid claimed that they were maliciously added by a hacker; her lawyer said the FBI was investigating the claim. Investigations from both right and left-wing news outlets decisively disproved\u00a0the \u201chacking\u201d claims. Reid went on air\u00a0and apologized for them, though she continued to claim\u00a0\u201cI genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things.\u201d MSNBC has kept Reid on its staff and has not further addressed the controversy.",

These are the sort of people who willingly and actively give rise to dictators.\u201d  \u201cBut there are still enough check and balances, enough gaps in their suppression and gerrymandering attempts, for the majority of Americans to stand up and save our republic from those who would replace it with dictatorship,\u201d he continued It\u2019s our obligation to do so\u2026\u201d  Willimon\u2019s hit Netflix political drama,\u00a0House of Cards,\u00a0depicts the rise of power-hungry couple Frank (Kevin Spacey) and Claire Underwood (Robin Wright) as they ascend to the U.S. presidency.

Orrin Hatch (R-UT), he and 12 other Republican Senators have taken the extreme, open borders position that the Trump administration should release every illegal alien who crosses the southern border with a child into the interior of the U.S. The plan would spur a completely open border until the Republican-controlled Congress passes legislation that allows children to be detained with the border-crossing adults that they arrived in the U.S. with. \u201cWe, therefore, ask you to halt implementation of the Department\u2019s zero tolerance policy while Congress works out a solution that enables faster processing of individuals who enter our country illegally without requiring the forced, inhumane separation of children from their parents,\u201d the letter signed by the 13 Republican Senators states. \u201cWe believe a reasonable path forward can be found that accommodates the need to enforce our laws while holding true to other, equally essential values.\u201d Here, Breitbart News has compiled a list of all the Republican Senators supporting this plan to stop all border enforcement: Pushing back against the Republican establishment and Democrats\u2019 efforts to end all border enforcement is Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), who most recently slammed a plan that would allow all illegal aliens crossing the border with children to be released into the U.S. \u201cDems\u2019 Keep Families Together Act is better called the Child Trafficking Encouragement Act,\u201d Cotton said, as Breitbart News reported. \u201cShow up at border with a minor & call him your child, then you get released into the US! Children will be abducted & sold to drug cartels & slave-traders as a free ticket into US.\u201d President Trump has asked the Republican-controlled Congress to enact his plan, which would allow border-crossing children to be detained with their guardians and parents for extended periods of time. This plan would speed up the asylum and immigration hearing process, and allow the family unit to be deported together back to their native country. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

      "author": "Tom Fitton",
      "content": " We\u2019re now understanding why the Congress didn\u2019t do much of anything about it. Judicial Watch released\u00a0internal IRS\u00a0documents revealing that Sen. John McCain\u2019s former staff director and chief counsel on the Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee, Henry Kerner, urged top IRS officials, including then-director of exempt organizations, Lois Lerner, to \u201caudit so many that it becomes financially ruinous.\u201d President Trump, presumably unaware of these new facts, appointed Kerner as Special Counsel for the United States Office of Special Counsel. The explosive exchange was contained in notes taken by IRS employees at an April 30, 2013, meeting between Kerner, Lerner, and other high-ranking IRS officials. Just ten days following the meeting, Lois Lerner admitted that the IRS had a policy of improperly and deliberately delaying applications for tax-exempt status from conservative non-profit groups. Lerner and other IRS officials met with select top staffers from the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee in a \u201cmarathon\u201d meeting to discuss concerns raised by both Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) that the IRS was not reining in political advocacy groups in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s\u00a0Citizens United\u00a0decision. Senator McCain had been the chief sponsor of the McCain-Feingold Act and called the\u00a0Citizens United\u00a0decision, which overturned portions of the Act, one of the \u201cworst decisions I have ever seen.\u201d In the full notes of an April 30 meeting, McCain\u2019s high-ranking staffer Kerner recommends harassing non-profit groups until they are unable to continue operating. Kerner tells Lerner, Steve Miller, Nikole Flax, then chief of staff to IRS commissioner, and other IRS officials, \u201cMaybe the solution is to audit so many that it is\u00a0financially\u00a0ruinous.\u201d In response, Lerner responded that \u201cit is her job to oversee it all:\u201d Judicial Watch\u00a0previously reported\u00a0on the 2013 meeting. Senator McCain then\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0decrying \u201cfalse reports claiming that his office was somehow involved in IRS targeting of conservative groups.\u201d The IRS previously blacked out the\u00a0notes of the meeting, but we found the notes among subsequent documents released by the agency. Judicial Watch\u00a0separately uncovered\u00a0that Lerner was under significant pressure from both Democrats in Congress and the Obama DOJ and FBI to prosecute and jail the groups the IRS was already improperly targeting. In\u00a0discussing pressure\u00a0from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) to prosecute these \u201cpolitical groups,\u201d Lerner admitted, \u201cit is ALL about 501(c)(4) orgs and political activity.\u201d The April 30, 2013 meeting came just under two weeks prior to Lerner\u2019s admission during an American Bar Association meeting that the IRS had \u201cinappropriately\u201d targeted conservative groups. In her\u00a0May 2013 answer\u00a0to a\u00a0planted question, in which she admitted to the \u201cabsolutely incorrect, insensitive, and inappropriate\u201d targeting of Tea Party and conservative groups, Lerner suggested the IRS targeting occurred due to an \u201cuptick\u201d in 501 (c)(4) applications to the IRS but in actuality, there had been a\u00a0decrease\u00a0in such applications in 2010. On May 14, 2013, a report by\u00a0Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration\u00a0revealed: \u201cEarly in Calendar Year 2010, the IRS began using inappropriate criteria to identify organizations applying for tax-exempt status\u201d (e.g., lists of past and future donors). The illegal IRS reviews continued \u201cfor more than 18 months\u201d and \u201cdelayed processing of targeted groups\u2019 applications\u201d in advance of the 2012 presidential election. All these documents were forced out of the IRS as a result of an October 2013 Judicial Watch Freedom of Information (FOIA)\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed against the IRS after it failed to respond adequately to four FOIA requests sent in May 2013 (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Internal Revenue Service\u00a0(No. 1:13-cv-01559)). Judicial Watch is seeking: The Obama IRS scandal is bipartisan \u2013 McCain and Democrats who wanted to regulate political speech lost at the Supreme Court, so they sought to use the IRS to harass innocent Americans. The Obama IRS scandal is not over. Judicial Watch continues to uncover smoking gun documents that raise questions about how the Obama administration weaponized the IRS, the FEC, FBI, and DOJ to target the First Amendment Rights of Americans.

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " The Arizona\u00a0senator released a statement describing President Trump\u2019s remarks during the press conference as \u201cpathetic,\u201d disgraceful,\u201d and \u201cpainful\u201d to observe \u2014 \u201ca recent low point in the history of the American Presidency.\u201d  \u201cToday\u2019s press conference in Helsinki was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory. The damage inflicted by President Trump\u2019s naivet\u00e9, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate. But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake,\u201d Sen. McCain\u2019s statement begins.\u00a0\u201cPresident Trump proved not only unable, but unwilling to stand up to Putin. He and Putin seemed to be speaking from the same script as the president made a conscious choice to defend a tyrant against the fair questions of a free press, and to grant Putin an uncontested platform to spew propaganda and lies to the world.\u201d It is tempting to describe the press conference as a pathetic rout \u2013 as an illustration of the perils of under-preparation and inexperience. But these were not the errant tweets of a novice politician. These were the deliberate choices of a president who seems determined to realize his delusions of a warm relationship with Putin\u2019s regime without any regard for the true nature of his rule, his violent disregard for the sovereignty of his neighbors, his complicity in the slaughter of the Syrian people, his violation of international treaties, and his assault on democratic institutions throughout the world. McCain highlighted the coziness between President Trump and his Russian counterpoint in contrast to his tough talk towards the United States\u2019 European allies. Last Wednesday, President Trump scolded Germany during a breakfast with NATO officials in Brussel over Berlin\u2019s support\u00a0of a Baltic Sea gas pipeline deal with the Kremlin, describing Europe\u2019s largest economy as a \u201ccaptive of Russians.\u201d In an interview with British tabloid The Sun,\u00a0President\u00a0 Trump predicted the British government\u2019s proposed watered down Brexit strategy \u201cwill probably kill\u201d hopes of a bilateral trade agreement with the United States. Ahead of his high-stakes meeting with Putin, President Trump branded the European Union a \u201cfoe\u201d in respect to trade. \u201cComing close on the heels of President Trump\u2019s bombastic and erratic conduct towards our closest friends and allies in Brussels and Britain, today\u2019s press conference marks a recent low point in the history of the American Presidency,\u201d the statement continues.\u201d That the president was attended in Helsinki by a team of competent and patriotic advisors makes his blunders and capitulations all the more painful and inexplicable.\u201d McCain concluded his blistering statement by accusing Trump of failing to uphold American values abroad, something he claims the president has failed to do since winning the White House. \u201cNo prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant. Not only did President Trump fail to speak the truth about an adversary; but speaking for America to the world, our president failed to defend all that makes us who we are\u2014a republic of free people dedicated to the cause of liberty at home and abroad. American presidents must be the champions of that cause if it is to succeed,\u201d McCain said. \u201cAmericans are waiting and hoping for President Trump to embrace that sacred responsibility. One can only hope they are not waiting totally in vain.\u201d Presidents Trump and Putin vowed a fresh start to troubled relations between the world\u2019s greatest nuclear powers at their summit, as the American leader rejected a chance to condemn Moscow\u2019s alleged manipulation of U.S. elections. Standing alongside Putin at a joint news conference, President Trump said he had \u201cspent a great deal of time talking about\u201d election meddling, without going into detail or explicitly condemning any interference\u00a0after 12 Russian agents were indicted in the United States. When pressed about alleged meddling, President Trump stressed that Putin had delivered a \u201cpowerful\u201d denial of any Russian vote meddling and said the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller had been a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the United States. President Trump again denied any collusion between his campaign and the Kremlin, while Putin insisted: \u201cThe Russian state has never interfered and is not planning to interfere in the USA\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d The\u00a0Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.",

      "content": "  \u201cLast summer, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: He had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious,\u201d the announcement reads. \u201cIn the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cWith his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.\u201d The longtime Republican lawmaker, who has remained away from Capitol Hill since December, began medical treatment for this cancer in July of 2017. \u201cMr. McCain\u2019s family has gathered in Arizona, and people close to him say his death is imminent,\u201d a source told the New York Times. McCain has been one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most vocal Republican critics, given Trump\u2019s infamous campaign-trail insult of his Vietnam War captivity. The senator wrote in his book Restless Wave that today\u2019s GOP is on the wrong side of the immigration debate. \u201cRight now, Republicans are on the wrong side of that progress,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd if we want to retain our competitiveness in the fastest-growing communities in the country we\u2019ll stop letting the zealots drive the debate, and fix the problems that [give] them their soapbox.\u201d McCain, who has said America-First conservatives make up a mere sliver of the Party, also wrote the faction must be \u201cconfronted before their noxious views spread further and damage for generations the reputation of the Republican Party.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re still a small fraction in the Republican Party. But they\u2019re the ones getting all the attention right now. They need to be confronted, not ignored or winked at or quietly dismissed as kooks,\u201d the former presidential candidate wrote. \u201cThey need to be confronted before their noxious views spread further and damage for generations the reputation of the Republican Party.\u201d McCain infamously voted twice to protect the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare. Last July, he helped defeat a \u201cskinny\u201d repeal bill 49 to 51 in a dramatic, late-night vote. McCain then went on to vote against the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill in September. The ailing Senator\u2019s daughter, Meghan McCain, thanked supporters for their \u201clove and generosity,\u201d over the course of the year.\u00a0\u201cMy family is deeply appreciative of all the love and generosity you have shown us during this past year McCain tweeted. Thank you for all your continued support and prayers. We could not have made it this far without you \u2013 you\u2019ve given us strength to carry on.\u201d",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " McCain was born on a U.S. Navy base in Panama in 1936, the son and grandson of career Navy officers. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and served as a Navy pilot in the Vietnam War. He was shot down over Hanoi in 1967\u00a0and was\u00a0a prisoner of war for five and a half years. McCain was tortured by the North Vietnamese, leaving him permanently disabled. He famously refused to be released ahead of POWs\u00a0who had been captured first \u2014 denying the enemy\u00a0a propaganda coup, since his father was then the commander of all U.S. forces in Vietnam. Upon his release in 1973, McCain studied at the Naval War College in Washington, DC, where he puzzled over the question of America\u2019s struggles in Vietnam, ultimately concluding that lack of political commitment to victory had led to defeat. It was a lesson that would guide his later approach, in Congress, to America\u2019s foreign interventions. McCain was assigned to be\u00a0the Navy\u2019s liaison to the Senate in 1977, which served as his introduction to politics. He retired in 1981 and ran for Congress in Arizona\u2019s first congressional district in 1982, and won. He opposed U.S. intervention in Lebanon, defying\u00a0President Ronald Reagan, warning that there was no\u00a0clear strategy for victory. He was proved correct, tragically, when a terrorist\u00a0drove a truck bomb into the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut later that year, killing hundreds of American and French peacekeeping troops and leading to an American withdrawal. In 1986, McCain won his first term in the U.S. Senate. He soon found himself embroiled in scandal as one of the Keating Five, accused of intervening in a federal investigation of the Lincoln Savings and Loan, run by McCain donor Charles H. Keating, Jr. McCain\u00a0was cleared of any wrongdoing beyond poor judgment, but the experience had\u00a0scarred him deeply, and he committed the rest of his Senate career to fighting against corruption and waste. McCain soon developed a reputation as a \u201cmaverick,\u201d defying his party whenever he thought it was veering too far to the right (or, critics said, whenever it suited his own\u00a0ambitions). In 2000, McCain ran for President, mounting a strong primary campaign against Texas governor George W. Bush and winning New Hampshire, where his brand of centrist politics found traction. He lost\u00a0a bitter South Carolina primary race, however, and soon ran out of steam. In the Senate, McCain continued to build a profile as a reformer.\u00a0His major achievement was the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law, officially known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), which passed in 2002. Many Republicans were deeply critical of BCRA, which they saw as a form of unilateral disarmament and a limit on free speech. Parts of the law were ruled\u00a0unconstitutional in the controversial\u00a0Citizens United case in 2010. McCain also joined\u00a0the \u201cGang of 14,\u201d a bipartisan group of Senators that fought to preserve the filibuster after the Republicans threatened to end it\u00a0in response to\u00a0Democrats repeatedly blocking\u00a0President Bush\u2019s judicial nominees. And McCain continued to work with Democrats, notably Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), in proposing\u00a0immigration reform bills that were backed by the administration but ultimately\u00a0collapsed due to opposition\u00a0within both parties. In 2003, McCain joined a bipartisan majority in the Senate in supporting the Iraq War. But unlike many others, who abandoned the war as a terrorist insurgency grew, McCain remained committed to victory. Drawing from his ideas on Vietnam, he argued that the U.S. needed additional troops to secure Iraqi cities, defeat local Al-Qaeda cells, and prevent new terrorists from infiltrating. As the war grew more unpopular, he was virtually alone in his position. However, President George W. Bush agreed with him, and launched the \u201csurge\u201d in 2007, in defiance of the opinions of the top military brass and the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan panel that recommended reducing U.S. commitment to the war. McCain put aside his old rivalry with Bush and became the best surrogate for the White House\u2019s policy. In 2007, McCain launched a second presidential campaign. He was seen as a long-shot candidate, especially after his campaign lost several key staff members in mid-2007. But his steadfast commitment to the surge helped him to stand out among the other candidates on the debate stage, and voters were\u00a0moved\u00a0by the force of his convictions. In addition, it was clear that the electorate was ready for change, and McCain made the case that he alone among Republicans had a record of fighting for reforms. He won New Hampshire again, and eventually the nomination. In the general election, McCain faced\u00a0then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL), who had\u00a0just won a spectacular, if brutal, victory over then-Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) in the Democratic primary. McCain made the controversial\u00a0decision not to attack Obama for his deep ties to the racist Chicago preacher Jeremiah Wright \u2014 perhaps out of a sense of guilt for his own early opposition to naming a pubic holiday for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., which he regretted. McCain trailed Obama for most of the summer of 2008. But\u00a0he bested Obama at a religious forum hosted by pastor Rick Warren, and then upended the entire race by naming Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, the first time a woman had been named to a Republican presidential ticket. Palin, a corruption-busting fellow \u201cmaverick,\u201d captured the public imagination and briefly attracted the interest of women voters disappointed by Clinton\u2019s loss. But the McCain-Palin lead was short-lived. The media targeted Palin with hostile, even condescending, coverage. And then, in mid-September, the global financial crisis struck as Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers collapsed. Obama, who had criticized the Bush administration\u2019s economic performance for months, seemed prescient. McCain decided to show leadership by suspending his campaign and returning to Washington, DC, where he\u00a0backed a $700 billion bailout\u00a0in the form of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), which was decried by conservatives and liberals alike. Obama, too, voted for TARP, but by the time they arrived at the first presidential debate a few days later, there was no longer any real difference between the candidates. Obama\u00a0went on to win the election easily. Conventional wisdom in party establishment circles partly blamed Palin for McCain\u2019s loss, but she helped turn out the conservative vote in areas where the moderate McCain had struggled to connect. Recently, McCain said that he regretted choosing Palin instead of Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a fellow foreign policy hawk and the man who nearly became vice president on the Democratic ticket with Al Gore in 2000. Back in the Senate, McCain remained deeply critical of Obama\u2019s foreign policies, as the new administration backed away from the country\u2019s previous commitments to Iraq, creating a vacuum for the Iranian regime and new terrorist groups like the so-called Islamic State. But McCain remained a maverick, and joined the bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight\u201d in proposing a new immigration reform bill \u2014 despite having run for re-election in 2010 on a promise to \u201cbuild the danged fence\u201d along the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill ultimately died due to conservative opposition in the House. In 2015, McCain was deeply critical of\u00a0Donald Trump, who had entered the race for president on a platform of strong opposition to illegal immigration. In response, Trump aimed a pointed insult at McCain\u2019s war record: \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d That ignited a feud that never ended. McCain\u2019s decisive, dramatic \u201cthumbs-down\u201d vote to defeat an effort to repeal Obamacare in July 2017 was widely perceived\u00a0as motivated by personal revenge. McCain announced that he had brain cancer last July, but continued to work in the Senate as he received treatment. His condition worsened in recent months, and he returned to Arizona to convalesce at home, surrounded by friends and family. His family announced on Aug. 24 that he was ending medical treatment. He is survived by his wife, Cindy McCain (n\u00e9e Hensley), his first wife,\u00a0Carol Shepp McCain; seven children, many grandchildren, and his redoubtable mother, Roberta, still alive at the ripe old age of 106. Associates of the ailing Senator made it clear in the closing days of his life that he did not want President Trump to attend his funeral. John McCain will be remembered for many things \u2014 his heroic endurance in Vietnam, his passion for reform, his battles with his own party, and his\u00a0support for the military. But perhaps the most memorable\u00a0tribute came from the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, who wrote after McCain\u2019s tough loss in the 2008 election: \u201cHe will be \u2014 he should be \u2014 remembered as the most worthy presidential nominee ever to be denied the prize.\u201d Joel B.

Trump remained furious with McCain after the veteran senator killed a final Senate effort to repeal Obamacare in the summer of 2017 by voting no in an early morning vote. Although not mentioning\u00a0McCain by name, Trump has spent months blaming him for ruining the Republican effort to end Obamacare, despite his battle with cancer. When it looked like McCain would support the 2017 effort, Trump praised him for returning to vote for an Obamacare repeal.  The pair famously tangled in 2015, when McCain called Trump\u2019s 15,000 supporters who appeared for a rally in Phoenix as \u201ccrazies\u201d and criticized his rhetoric on immigration. \u201cThis performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me,\u201d McCain said in an interview with the New Yorker. \u201cBecause what he did was he fired up the crazies.\u201d Trump responded by calling McCain a \u201cdummy.\u201d  When confronted by his rhetoric by pollster Frank Luntz at an evangelical forum in Iowa, Trump went further, dismissing the notion that the Arizona Senator was a war hero because \u201che was captured.\u201d ",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " The\u00a0Daily Mail reported, with original ALL CAPS: \u201cDonald Trump returns to the golf course just 17 HOURS after the death of John McCain as he faces criticism for failing to properly honor GOP giant\u2019s life and legacy.\u201d\n\nAccording to the article, written by Megan Sheets, Trump\u00a0was guilty of having merely posted a \u201cmeager tweet with his condolences\u201d before returning to golf nearly a full day later. Sheets reported: Donald Trump was spotted arriving at the golf course on Sunday morning, less than 17 hours after the death of Senator John McCain. The president has remained somewhat quiet about the Arizona Republican senator\u2019s death, drawing criticism from both sides of the aisle after he posted a meager tweet with his condolences for the family that failed to acknowledge the impact McCain has had on American political life, and his record as one of the nation\u2019s most celebrated war heroes. A group of both supporters and protesters gathered outside the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, as the president arrived, holding Make America Great Again signs as well as others that say \u2018FAKE PRESIDENT\u2019 and \u2018RESIGN NOW\u2019. McCain had pointedly excluded Trump from attending his funeral, but apparently the president was expected to honor some sort of golf ban, out of respect. In 2014, Obama golfed immediately after American journalist James Foley was beheaded by the terrorists of the so-called \u201cIslamic State.\u201d In 2002, President George W. Bush infamously teed off \u2014 \u201cNow watch this drive\u201d \u2014 immediately after delivering a statement condemning terrorists. But Trump, as Sheets reported, waited a mere 17 hours after expressing condolences to McCain\u2019s family to enjoy a private golf game with his own. Joel B.

Transcript (via CNBC) of the Statement: \u201cMy fellow Americans, whom I have gratefully served for sixty years, and especially my fellow Arizonans, Thank you for the privilege of serving you and for the rewarding life that service in uniform and in public office has allowed me to lead. I have tried to serve our country honorably. I have made mistakes, but I hope my love for America will be weighed favorably against them. I have often observed that I am the luckiest person on earth. I feel that way even now as I prepare for the end of my life. I have loved my life, all of it. I have had experiences, adventures and friendships enough for ten satisfying lives, and I am so thankful. Like most people, I have regrets. But I would not trade a day of my life, in good or bad times, for the best day of anyone else\u2019s. I owe that satisfaction to the love of my family. No man ever had a more loving wife or children he was prouder of than I am of mine. And I owe it to America. To be connected to America\u2019s causes \u2013 liberty, equal justice, respect for the dignity of all people \u2013 brings happiness more sublime than life\u2019s fleeting pleasures. Our identities and sense of worth are not circumscribed but enlarged by serving good causes bigger than ourselves. \u2018Fellow Americans\u2019 \u2013 that association has meant more to me than any other. I lived and died a proud American. We are citizens of the world\u2019s greatest republic, a nation of ideals, not blood and soil. We are blessed and are a blessing to humanity when we uphold and advance those ideals at home and in the world. We have helped liberate more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. We have acquired great wealth and power in the process. We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe. We weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down, when we doubt the power of our ideals, rather than trust them to be the great force for change they have always been. We are three-hundred-and-twenty-five million opinionated, vociferous individuals. We argue and compete and sometimes even vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we have always had so much more in common with each other than in disagreement. If only we remember that and give each other the benefit of the presumption that we all love our country we will get through these challenging times. We will come through them stronger than before. We always do. Ten years ago, I had the privilege to concede defeat in the election for president. I want to end my farewell to you with the heartfelt faith in Americans that I felt so powerfully that evening. I feel it powerfully still. Do not despair of our present difficulties but believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history. Farewell, fellow Americans. God bless you, and God bless America.\u201d Follow Ian\u00a0Hanchett on Twitter\u00a0@IanHanchett",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " In some cases, the hyperbole is embarrassing. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) used his status as an icon of the civil rights struggle to trash McCain as a racist, accusing him of \u201csowing the seeds of hatred and division.\u201d After McCain\u2019s passing on Saturday, Lewis called him a \u201cwarrior for peace\u201d \u201cwho was never afraid to do what he believed was right.\u201d The Democrats\u2019 obvious goal \u2014 one shared by the media and the \u201cNever Trump\u201d faction of Republicans \u2014 is to use McCain\u2019s death to attack Trump. There is reason to believe that McCain would have wanted it that way. He made it known, publicly and well in advance, that he did not want the president to attend his funeral. Instead, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama \u2014 no fans of the 45th president \u2014 will be there. Most eulogies will not attack Trump directly, but the media will find every slight between the lines. Sadly, McCain\u2019s passing is not being observed for what it is \u2014 the exit of a heroic, if flawed, American hero. Instead, it is being used to rally opposition to Trump. The media, who did so much to thwart McCain\u2019s presidential ambitions, are now indulging in hagiography. In 2008, CNN speculated about whether McCain was too old to be president. On Monday morning, it served up a sentimental piece about how he had loved Abba, the Swedish seventies supergroup. There is little evidence to suggest the public \u2014 which liked, but did not love, McCain \u2014 shares the Beltway\u2019s new nostalgia, and it may backfire as the effort to exploit his death becomes too egregious to ignore. Democrats and their allies in the media seem to have forgotten the lessons of the memorial of Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-MN), who died tragically in a plane crash in 2002. The eulogies were brazenly political, turning a moment of national mourning into a campaign rally. The public turned away in disgust, and some analysts concluded\u00a0it cost Democrats the election four days later. It was one of the few times in recent decades that the opposition party has failed to take Congress during a midterm election. The presence of so many Republicans at McCain\u2019s funeral may temper the anti-Trump zeal. Or \u2014 given the high profile of \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans in the McCain camp \u2014 it may not. The death of Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) in 2009 offers a similar cautionary example. After months of tributes, in which Americans were instructed that Obamacare would be the legacy of the \u201cLion of the Senate,\u201d Massachusetts voters went to the polls and elected Republican Scott Brown, who opposed the bill, to replace him. CNN\u2019s David Gergen, a fixture of the establishment, inadvertently cemented Brown\u2019s victory when he referred to \u201cthe Kennedy seat\u201d in moderating a debate. \u201cIt\u2019s the people\u2019s seat,\u201d Brown retorted. McCain was a great and respected man, but the media, and the Beltway, have always overestimated his popular appeal. As they exploit his passing, they may find that instead of rallying Trump\u2019s opponents, they will have rallied his supporters. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "content": " Camerota, during a New Day segment led by the chyron \u201cRemembering John McCain,\u201d repeatedly requested Sununu\u2019s comment on reports \u2014 based on anonymous sources from CNN and the Washington Post \u2014 that the White House had rejected a proposal to release a statement regarding \u201cJohn McCain\u2019s service and sacrifice.\u201d Sununu charged Camerota with playing \u201cpolitical games\u201d to \u201cexploit\u201d allegations related to McCain\u2019s death. He chided the anchor for pushing this narrative instead of just letting him pay tribute to his dead friend.  Partial transcript below [emphases added]. CAMEROTA: So governor, what do you think about President Trump rejecting the practice of putting out an official White House statement about John McCain\u2019s service and sacrifice? SUNUNU: Look, that was printed in the Washington Post, and I have to be honest with you, I don\u2019t put much credence to what I read in the Post. CAMEROTA: We also have that reporting. SUNUNU: Yeah, well. Same thing applies, Alisyn. CAMEROTA: Governor, you come on CNN and we appreciate you coming on CNN and we appreciate your take on it, but I don\u2019t appreciate you denigrating our reporting. I think that you know we have excellent reporters here, but are you saying that you don\u2019t want to believe that? You don\u2019t want to believe that President Trump would do that about John McCain? SUNUNU: I\u2019m saying that I don\u2019t want to comment on a report that I haven\u2019t satisfied myself is correct. CAMEROTA: And if that report were true? SUNUNU: I\u2019m not going to answer the hypothetical. CAMEROTA: It\u2019s not a hypothetical. This is our reporting. We have rock-solid sources in the White House. \u2026 SUNUNU: I think this effort to create a cleavage between the White House and those that are mourning John McCain really does disturb me. It is this effort by the press to accentuate the negative that I think have created the climate that prevents, in the long term, the bipartisanship that John McCain supported. I don\u2019t want to be a part of rubbing whatever salt there in whatever wound there may be, because I think that just adds to the division. I\u2019m here because I lost a good friend. I wanted to express my concern about that. \u2026 I\u2019m not here to play the political games that some in the press want to play at this moment\u2026 of great sorrow for the country. CAMEROTA: To be clear, we don\u2019t see it as a game. \u2026 SUNUNU: I\u2019m here to talk about my friend, John McCain. You appear to be here to talk about something that you think you can exploit, and I find that rather unpleasant. CNN markets itself as a politically objective and non-partisan news media outlet. It brands itself as \u201cThe Most Trusted Name In Name\u201d with the slogan \u201cFacts First.\u201d Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " It\u2019s a working class thing, a guy thing, something men do to get under each other\u2019s skin. And Trump works in the art of ball breaking like Sinatra did song. To the uninitiated, ball breaking sounds shockingly cruel. Oddly enough, though, it is nothing personal. The only goal is to needle around for a weak spot until the other guy loses his composure. It\u2019s a competition, a sport. What\u2019s more, Trump\u00a0didn\u2019t start it, and in the end, McCain would lose when he voted against the repeal of Obamacare. There are many ways to lose a ball breaking contest. One is to allow the other guy to burrow so far under your skin, you take things too far. When McCain voted against repealing Obamacare, McCain violated something he held most dear\u2026 He broke his word. He lost his composure. Regardless, most of the outrage against Trump over the \u201ccaptured\u201d shot is purely political, especially in the establishment media. Democrats say much worse things about Republicans every day, and you don\u2019t see Jake Tapper sputtering about decency grasping his pearls for three years. Tapper couldn\u2019t even get his sanctimony on as his own audience booed a rape victim. In other words, the media are not at all sincere in their outrage over Trump\u2019s shot at McCain. What the media are actually outraged over is that they could not bully Trump into an apology. Trump refusing to apologize to their mob is what the media find unforgivable. The only thing the media find unforgivable is defiance. We know this for the reasons stated above, and we know this because just a few years earlier, during the 2008 presidential election, this very same media that pretends to cherish McCain as all things wise and wonderful now, most especially in the wake of his death over the weekend, were the same media who savaged his character, his integrity, and his patriotism \u2014 and, yes, his military service \u2014 in ways that make Trump\u2019s ball break look like a love tap. As is always the case with our corrupt media, the hypocrisy is audacious and partisan politics purely mercenary. Gushing over McCain (not that he does not deserve legitimate praise for his valiant military service) is nothing less than an easy opportunity for the media to launch yet another Two-Minute Hate against Trump. Let me state this as plainly as I can\u2026 When John McCain could be used by the media to achieve their left-wing goals (save Obamacare, a club against Trump), they adore the guy. He\u2019s the \u201cmaverick\u201d again, a national hero, a true patriot\u2026 But when John McCain stood in the way of the media\u2019s left-wing goals, most especially the goal of anointing the radical left-wing Obama president, McCain was an old, dying, rich, white, adulterous, corrupt, racist warmonger too unstable to be president. And for the following the media have never apologized\u2026 The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0ran a\u00a0Birther campaign\u00a0to\u00a0disqualify McCain, a campaign very similar to the one Hillary Clinton was running against Obama at the time. McCain the \u201cwarmonger.\u201d McCain the\u00a0racist. McCain the racist\u00a0again. And\u00a0again. McCain the\u00a0politically corrupt adulterer. Here is the media\u2019s favorite general,\u00a0 Wesley Clark, mocking McCain for getting shot down, and no one in the media ever demanded an apology. \u201cThat large squadron in the Navy [McCain] commanded \u2014 that wasn\u2019t a wartime squadron,\u201d Clark\u00a0said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think getting in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to become president.\u201d Obama adviser Rand Beers\u00a0mocked McCain\u2019s\u00a0POW status, saying \u201cthat because McCain was in an unfortunate state of \u2018isolation\u2019 during much of the Vietnam War,\u00a0 his national security experience is \u2018sadly limited.'\u201d McCain is\u00a0too old,\u00a0too old,\u00a0too old,\u00a0too old and wrinkly\u2026 McCain is too erratic,\u00a0too angry, McCain is a\u00a0liar, an\u00a0adulterous liar, a\u00a0dishonorable\u00a0man. The far-left\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0accused McCain of being a\u00a0liar who lies about his own war record. PolitiFact described McCain a POW who \u201cbargained\u201d with the enemy. I could go on and on and on\u2026 The establishment media\u2019s 2008 jihad to personally destroy John McCain, a legitimate war hero, to annihilate his character, his war record, his sanity, was equal parts appalling and relentless. And anyone who is still upset over Trump\u2019s remark and makes no mention of the media\u2019s indefensible behavior\u00a0has no credibility.

The White House issued a statement on re-lowering of the flag and some details of how the Trump administration will pay tribute to Sen. McCain: Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain\u2019s service to our country and, in his honor, have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment. I have asked Vice President Mike Pence to offer an address at the ceremony honoring Senator McCain at the United States Capitol this Friday. At the request of the McCain family, I have also authorized military transportation of Senator McCain\u2019s remains from Arizona to Washington, D.C., military pallbearers and band support, and a horse and caisson transport during the service at the United States Naval Academy. Finally, I have asked General John Kelly, Secretary James Mattis, and Ambassador John Bolton to represent my Administration at his services. President Trump also issued the following proclamation on the death of Sen. McCain and lowering of the flag: As a mark of respect for the memory and longstanding service of Senator John Sidney McCain III, I\u00a0hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United\u00a0States of America, that the flag of the United\u00a0States shall be flown at half-staff at the White\u00a0House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United\u00a0States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, on the day of interment.\u00a0 I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half\u2011staff for the same period at all United\u00a0States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. The Huffington Post ran the headline \u201cWhite House lowers flag to half staff as nation honors John McCain\u201d on Monday morning.

Schumer & Mitch McConnell called on the Department of Defense to force all flags on government buildings to be kept \u201cat half mast through sunset on the day of Senator McCain\u2019s internment.\u201d  Assistant to the President Dan Scavino Jr. posted video Saturday evening of the White House flag being lowered after word of McCain\u2019s death. \u201cThis evening, the @WhiteHouse flag has been lowered to half-staff in honor of Senator John McCain\u2026\u201d wrote Scavino.  \u201cMy deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!\u201d Trump wrote after McCain\u2019s passing.

      "content": " And what was on our minds? Well, other than the beautiful scenery and the tasks at hand, something of consequence had happened just before we took off. No, it was not the sad death of war hero John McCain, nor did it have anything to do with Paul Manafort or Michael Cohen. What was on our minds was the massive news about NAFTA, the bombshell announcement that, after 25 years, President Donald Trump had re-negotiated one of the biggest trade treaties in our country\u2019s history. But that was just us \u2014 that was what was on our minds. Among other things, there was also the news about a soaring stock market and 28 people (28!) shot over the weekend in Chicago, three of whom died. Which is to say that other people have other things on their own minds. What no one cared out about, though, at least outside of the trivial D.C. Swamp, was Half-MastGate. You see, in the Real World, people are concerned with real things \u2014 things that matter, things that touch their lives. I am talking about issues involving health care, personal debt, employment, immigration, income, crime, safety, potholes, the future. And Trump\u2019s re-negotiation of NAFTA touches on how many of those things? On how many lives? In what ways? And how soon? Sadly, if you went looking for NAFTA news (or Chicago news) in the establishment media, it was nowhere to be found. (Breitbart led with NAFTA through most of the day.) Instead, every time I had a few free moments to catch up, the establishment media were wholly consumed with Half-MastGate, this masturbatory nonsense about the status of the White House flag. This is not to say there is no news value in the bitter feud between Trump and McCain. This is not to say the status of the White House flag is not newsworthy. But are you freakin\u2019 kidding me with the blotting out of the sun with this inside-inside, everything-is-always-all-about-me bullshit? Good grief, after following my news feed yesterday afternoon, I knew more about cruise director Bill Kristol\u2019s afternoon walk than I did anything of consequence that actually affects everyday Americans. More or less against my will, I knew everything about every single itsy-bitsy-teeny-weeny, utterly meaningless detail regarding the positioning of the White House flag and the positioning of every other flag in D.C. And that was just online. Don\u2019t get me started on cable news. My apologies in advance for being blunt, but who gives a damn? I mean no offense against Trump or McCain or the McCain family. I do understand that this is important to them, but my name\u2019s Paul and this is between y\u2019all. Trump and McCain loathed one another, the White House flag flew at half-mast for the amount of time called for by the U.S. flag code, and who gives a damn? I\u2019ll tell you who gives a damn: self-appointed media elites who only care about themselves and their bitter little-bubbled world filled with bitter little battles over trifling things that do not matter to anyone outside of their velvet-lined salons. Twenty-eight people shot in a major city over the weekend, a massive realignment of our trading relationship with Mexico, the stock market at record highs, consequential new laws about opioid prescriptions \u2014 and our shallow, stupid, utterly useless news media are CONSUMED with\u00a0themselves; with taking a side in a meaningless personal feud (that Trump and the McCain family seemed to want no part of) that affects nothing and no one outside of the Hatfields and McCoys. Again, I am not saying the feud is not news, and I get that these things matter to Sen. McCain\u2019s friends and loved ones, and I even get that the media now has a psycho-sexual need to get its Two Minute Hate on against Trump every 24 hours or so. But where does this insatiable, preening, bubbled, arrogance come from that transforms a personal feud between two rich and powerful white guys into The Only Thing In The World That Matters? I\u2019m sorry but it doesn\u2019t matter, not to We the People, and neither does the media anymore, which is why we, like most everyone else driving around Western North Carolina that day, we listened to Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. If nothing else, at least they were talking about something else. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.",

      "content": " In a statement to CNN, NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said the proposition \u201cwill be considered carefully,\u201d by the military alliance. McCain was among Capitol Hill\u2019s staunchest proponent\u2019s of NATO and regularly advocated for the 29-nation alliance to expand to additional European countries. The Arizona lawmaker famously unloaded on fellow\u00a0senator Rand Paul (R-KY) after he blocked the ratification of a treaty to advance Montenegro\u2019s inclusion into NATO. \u201cThe senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin,\u201d McCain fumed in a Senate floor speech.\u00a0The Balkan country\u2019s accession to the body was finalized in June 2017. More recently,\u00a0McCain criticized President Donald Trump following a July meeting with NATO members in which he demanded fellow members increase\u00a0spending to help shoulder the costs of the alliance. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s performance at the NATO summit in Brussels was disappointing, yet ultimately unsurprising. There is little use in parsing the president\u2019s misstatements and bluster, except to say that they are the words of one man,\u201d a statement from the Senator\u2019s office read. McCain died last Saturday at the age of 81 following a months-long battle with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain\u00a0cancer.\u00a0NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg took to Twitter to pay tribute to McCain shortly after his death. \u201cJohn McCain \u2013 soldier and senator, American and Atlanticist. He will be remembered both in Europe and North America for his courage and character, and as a strong supporter of NATO,\u201d Stoltenberg said in a statement. \u201cMy thoughts are with his family and loved ones.\u201d  Tugendhat wrote in a letter to NATO that he would like the organization\u2019s headquarters to bear the name of the Vietnam prisoner of war because \u201cvery few people embodied the values that NATO is built on in the way Sen. John McCain III did.\u201d \u201cThere can be no more fitting tribute to his career and the values that Sen. McCain espoused \u2013 but also no better message for NATO to send at this time of global tension \u2013 than to name its new headquarters building after the American statesman,\u201d added the British lawmaker. In Washington, D.C., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is proposing legislation to rename the\u00a0Russell Senate Office Building after McCain, which was named after former Georgia Sen. Richard Brevard Russell, Jr. in 1972. \u201cNothing will overcome the loss of Senator McCain, but so that generations remember him I will be introducing a resolution to rename the Russell building after him,\u201d said Schumer. Efforts have stalled to rename the Russell Senate Office in memory of McCain after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on Tuesday announced a bipartisan committee to evaluate potential proposals to honor the late senator.",

      "content": " And, boy, is the political and media class taking this aphorism to extraordinary extremes in the case of the late Sen. John McCain! To hear all the plaudits being lavished on this apparent paragon, you\u2019d imagine that he was the greatest president America never had. And it\u2019s as bad on this side of the pond as it in the U.S. One virtue-signaling politician, a British conservative MP called Tom Tugendhat, has actually petitioned for the NATO headquarters to be renamed after McCain. According to Tugendhat, \u201cThere can be no more fitting tribute to his career and the values that Sen. McCain espoused\u00a0\u2014 but also no better message for NATO to send at this time of global tension\u00a0\u2014 than to name its new headquarters building after the American statesman.\u201d Really? Do Tugendhat or any of the other commentators queuing up to praise McCain actually know anything about the man, beyond his carefully cultivated propaganda myth as the heroic flier and POW who wouldn\u2019t buckle? I didn\u2019t. All I knew was that he was shot down in Vietnam (where he was apparently very stoical and brave) and that after that he became a failed presidential candidate, ending his career as a thorn in the side of Donald Trump. A modestly notable career, maybe. But hardly enough to justify all these \u201cwe shall never see his like again\u201d eulogies. But then, I caught sight of this fascinating Rolling Stone profile written by Tim Dickinson in 2008 at the time when McCain was supposedly the Republican Party\u2019s great white hope against Obama. OK, so it comes from a publication with a known leftist bias. But it gives the impression of being pretty thoroughly researched and sourced \u2013 and if it\u2019s even halfway accurate, then all those virtue-signalers currently pontificating about how marvelous McCain was ought to blush furiously over their ignorance and their misplaced praise. McCain\u00a0comes across like a pretty unpleasant piece of work. A spoiled brat with a huge sense of entitlement, hated by his schoolmates at college, an average flier, and not nearly the hero he has made himself out to be. Nor was his political career any more distinguished. Here was a man without any ideological principles, who blew relentlessly with the wind: one minute so left he almost became a Democrat, the next an ardent neocon, finally ending up defining himself by his opposition to the most popular and effective Republican president in decades\u2026 Look, I\u2019m not judging. I never did military service. I haven\u2019t a clue how I would have borne up if shot down and tortured by the North Vietnamese. But then, I\u2019m not a soldier or a navy flier; I\u2019m just a journalist whose stock in trade is facts. If I offer an opinion on something, I try to do a bit of research. Read the profile yourself if you\u2019re in any doubt. It\u2019s a long read but utterly gripping. Here\u2019s a taste \u2013 an encounter between McCain and a fellow Vietnam war ex-POW called John Dramesi: Like many American POWs, McCain broke down under torture and offered a \u201cconfession\u201d to his North Vietnamese captors. Dramesi, in contrast, attempted two daring escapes. For the second he was brutalized for a month with daily torture sessions that nearly killed him. His partner in the escape, Lt. Col. Ed Atterberry, didn\u2019t survive the mistreatment. But Dramesi never said a disloyal word, and for his heroism was awarded two Air Force Crosses, one of the service\u2019s highest distinctions. McCain would later hail him as \u201cone of the toughest guys I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d On the grounds between the two brick colleges, the chitchat between the scion of four-star admirals and the son of a prizefighter turns to their academic travels; both colleges sponsor a trip abroad for young officers to network with military and political leaders in a distant corner of the globe. \u201cI\u2019m going to the Middle East,\u201d Dramesi says. \u201cTurkey, Kuwait, Lebanon, Iran.\u201d \u201cWhy are you going to the Middle East?\u201d McCain asks, dismissively. \u201cIt\u2019s a place we\u2019re probably going to have some problems,\u201d Dramesi says. \u201cWhy? Where are you going to, John?\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to Rio.\u201d \u201cWhat the hell are you going to Rio for?\u201d McCain, a married father of three, shrugs. \u201cI got a better chance of getting laid.\u201d Dramesi, who went on to serve as chief war planner for U.S. Air Forces in Europe and commander of a wing of the Strategic Air Command, was not surprised. \u201cMcCain says his life changed while he was in Vietnam, and he is now a different man,\u201d Dramesi says today. \u201cBut he\u2019s still the undisciplined, spoiled brat that he was when he went in.\u201d Yet, now, according to his eulogists, we\u2019re supposed to airbrush all these awkward details out of history and concentrate on the most important lesson to be learned from the life of John McCain: that Donald Trump is the worst president ever and should be impeached. No really. I don\u2019t know why these people bother even\u00a0pretending\u00a0that they gave a damn about McCain or whether or not the flag was flown at half-staff outside the White House or any of the other sanctimonious drivel they\u2019ve been foisting on us these last two days. You can tell just by looking at the people saying this stuff: they\u2019re all either on the left or they are Never Trumpers. It\u2019s code: the more extravagant your praise for John McCain, the more strongly you are signaling how much you loathe Donald Trump. I wonder if this is how John McCain would have liked to be remembered: not so much for anything he did; more for being the person he was not. Meanwhile, in the real world, Trump goes on being one of the best U.S. presidents ever\u2026",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Breitbart News has independently confirmed an earlier report in\u00a0People magazine, which reported that Palin was not sent an invitation and was told through intermediaries to stay away from the ceremony. McCain fundraiser\u00a0Carla Eudy confirmed to\u00a0People that Palin had not been invited \u2014 possibly,\u00a0People speculated, at the behest of the McCain family. The news comes on the tenth anniversary of the date in 2008 when Palin was announced as McCain\u2019s pick for vice president. Palin now joins President Donald Trump on the list of those barred from the funeral. But unlike Trump, Palin never feuded with McCain and never criticized him. When news broke on Saturday of McCain\u2019s passing, Palin said, \u201cToday we lost an American original. Sen. John McCain was a maverick and a fighter, never afraid to stand for his beliefs. John never took the easy path in life \u2014 and through sacrifice and suffering he inspired others to serve something greater than self. \u201cJohn McCain was my friend. I will remember the good times. My family and I send prayers for Cindy and the McCain family.\u201d Last year, when McCain was reported to have\u00a0said that he regretted choosing Palin instead of Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT), Palin described the news as a \u201cgut punch\u201d but refused to blame McCain personally, telling the UK\u00a0Daily Mail that she blamed his \u201cghostwriters\u201d for such reports. When McCain selected Palin as his running mate, the two had both built reputations as corruption-busting \u201cmaverick\u201d leaders who were not afraid to buck their own parties. After the 2008 election, they moved in separate political directions. Palin became an inspirational figure for the Tea Party and for grassroots conservatives in general. McCain campaigned as a conservative border hawk in his 2010 re-election race but became a harsh critic of the Tea Party, calling Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rand Paul (R-KY) \u201cwacko birds.\u201d Many in the Beltway blamed Palin for McCain\u2019s loss in 2008 \u2014 even though Barack Obama had benefited from a sudden financial crisis and a biased press corps. That view seemed to have seeped into McCain\u2019s own thinking. Still, Palin never took offense and always honored McCain. Even after being excluded from the funeral, she declined to criticize him. People quoted a source close to the Palin family: \u201c[O]ut of respect for Sen. McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point. The Palin family will always cherish their friendship with the McCains and hold those memories dear.\u201d McCain will be laid to rest on Sunday in Annapolis, following several days of memorial events and ceremonies.

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": "  Transcript is as follows: And I say this with the deepest of sincerity \u2013 and I don\u2019t want calls on this, by the way: Am I the only person in America who thinks the passing of McCain and the news coverage has gone on a little too long and it\u2019s a little too much? Really, you can honor somebody, but this is going on day after day after day after day after day. And I don\u2019t say this out of any animus whatsoever, period. Why do some public officials get this kind of treatment \u2013 Kennedy, McCain, so forth \u2013 and others get no treatment whatsoever. You\u2019ve probably never even heard of them, probably weren\u2019t on TV as much as say McCain or Lindsey Graham and so forth. To me the heroic part of John McCain has nothing to do with his service in the Senate and everything to do with his service in the United States military, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s a hero to the American people \u2013 what he did in the United States military and what was done to him, and his bravery. And we have a gentleman \u2013 I just told you \u2013 he\u2019s still a member of the House of Representatives, by the name of Sam Johnson. Outside of Dallas, Texas, the vast majority of the American people have never heard of him. I have had him on the program in the past. And he won\u2019t get a send away like this. So, why? And again, I don\u2019t want calls on this. Is it because of his votes against Republicans, whether it was on immigration or Obamacare or tax cuts under Bush or things of that sort? I\u2019m quite serious about this. In the election of 2008, most of the same voices we\u2019re hearing today in the media and in the Democratic Party condemned McCain. Some even accused him of being racist \u2013 surprise, surprise, that\u2019s what they do \u2013 and strongly supported Obama and pushed Obama. You had nasty editorials written about McCain. They would talk about his temper. They would talk about potential\u2014they just went on and on and on. You and I, we\u2019re the ones that voted for McCain, and we lost badly. The main reason is we wanted to stop Obama. But is it because McCain didn\u2019t have fidelity to conservatism or Republicanism, or what is it? It\u2019s incredible. We had this, for two days, these attacks on the president for being cheap, for being low, for being worse, because of the flag not being at half-mast throughout the mourning period. The mourning period, I think, goes through Sunday. Okay, fine. I understand that \u2013 that is, the criticism. But you don\u2019t see the same kind of criticism applied to John McCain or the people who planned his goodbye in slighting Sarah Palin, which really is a mean thing to do. She never said a nasty word about John McCain, even when conservatives were raising questions about what he did and so forth. She never did. When I had her on a couple months ago, on Life, Liberty & Levin, wouldn\u2019t say a negative thing about him. Never did. She was his vice presidential running mate. He picked her. That seems to be a little bit more relevant to me than the flag flying at half-mast through Sunday, and yet you\u2019ll see almost no criticism of this by the same so-called news outlets, the same so-called voices , you know, the same crowd who can\u2019t wait to attack Trump. But I\u2019m just saying, it seems a little over the top to me, what\u2019s going on, and they\u2019re not done. Today is Thursday, right, Rich? So, we got Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So that\u2019s really a full week. And I want to make abundantly clear\u2014I want to say it again, because people like to twist my words and try to destroy our program\u2014this has nothing to do with animus. It\u2019s an observation. Was it because he was a presidential candidate? Is that what Mitt Romney will get? I don\u2019t know. But I suspect the media attention is more a result of him breaking with orthodox conservatism or traditional conservatism at key points, at which he was very, very helpful to the Democrat Party and the left, which, of course, we know the media embrace. Just one man\u2019s observation. [HT\u00a0CNS/Michael Morris]",

John McCain (R-AZ), used her eulogy as a thinly-veiled way to criticize Trump and his \u201ccheap rhetoric\u201d while boasting about her father\u2019s life. \u201cThe real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege,\u201d Meghan\u00a0told a packed audience at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, DC, Saturday. Meghan, who co-hosts ABC\u2019s The View, also mocked Trump\u2019s signature slogan \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d saying that \u201cAmerica was always great.\u201d \u201cAmerica does not boast because she does not have need to.\u00a0The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great,\u201d Meghan added, with many in the church applauding her statement. \u201cThe America of John McCain is the America of\u00a0the boys who rushed the colors in every war across three centuries knowing that in them is the life of the republic.\u201d Even though Meghan took the opportunity to criticize Trump during McCain\u2019s funeral, Trump was not present at the funeral. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) reportedly requested before he died that Trump not be invited to the funeral. McCain\u2019s family also refused to invite former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the Arizona senator\u2019s running mate in the 2008 presidential election. Palin did not receive an invitation, and intermediaries reportedly told her to keep away from the funeral. Unlike Trump, Palin never criticized or feuded with McCain. The late Arizona senator, who died of brain cancer at 81, had a strained relationship with Trump due to his disagreements with the president over many of his policies. The two often feuded during the 2016 presidential election cycle. Three former presidents\u2014Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton\u2014many members of Congress, world leaders, and McCain\u2019s family and friends gathered at the funeral in northwest Washington, DC, on Saturday.

Obama said,\u00a0\u201cPresident Bush and I are among the fortunate few who competed against John at the highest levels of politics.

So, for someone like John to ask you, while he\u2019s still alive, to stand and speak of him when he\u2019s gone, is a precious and singular honor. Now, when John called me with that request earlier this year, I\u2019ll admit sadness, and also a certain surprise. But after our conversation ended, I realized how well it captured some of John\u2019s essential qualities.\u201d Obama continued, \u201cTo start with, John liked being unpredictable, even a little contrarian. He had no interest in conforming to some prepackaged version of what a senator should be, and he didn\u2019t want a memorial that was going to be prepackaged either. It also showed John\u2019s disdain for self-pity. He had been to hell and back, and yet somehow never lost his energy or his optimism or his zest for life. So, cancer did not scare him, and he would maintain that buoyant spirit to the very end, too stubborn to sit still, opinionated as ever, fiercely devoted to his friends and most of all, to his family. It showed his irreverence, his sense of humor, a little bit of a mischievous streak. After all, what better way to get a last laugh than to make George and I say nice things about him to a national audience? And most of all, it showed a largeness of spirit, an ability to see past differences in search of common ground.\u201d Follow Ian\u00a0Hanchett on Twitter\u00a0@IanHanchett",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " \u201cThe Meg\u201d is a reference to a plus-sized shark in the late-summer hit movie The Meg, starring Jason Staham.  The New York Post cover is just one part of a brewing backlash against McCain and the overall funeral service for Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), which turned into an unseemly partisan rally Saturday with speakers like former Presidents Barack Obama and even George W. Bush trashing President Trump, who Sen. McCain refused to invite to his own funeral. Also not invited was former Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin, John McCain\u2019s unfailingly loyal 2008 vice presidential running mate. What made Saturday\u2019s shocking display all the more crass was that Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared were invited to the funeral and were forced to sit there and be humiliated, which might have been the plan. The McCains are infamous for holding petty grudges. In an obvious shot at Trump, Meghan McCain used her eulogy to describe the death of her father as the passing of \u201cAmerican greatness. The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.\u201d For good measure, she added, \u201cThe America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.\u201d Obama was also not subtle. He ripped into those who traffic in \u201cbombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage.\u201d \u201cJohn called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that,\u201d he added, which struck many as a rose-colored look at man known for lashing out and who once attacked two Republican senators as \u201cwacko birds\u201d for daring to disagree with him. Also, in an apparent fit of pique against Trump, one of McCain\u2019s final acts as a U.S. Senator was to violate his longstanding and oft-repeated promise to voters to repeal ObamaCare. Although McCain had repeatedly given his word over a number of years to repeal the unpopular boondoggle, when his was the deciding vote in July of 2017, before voting thumbs down, McCain reportedly said to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) \u201cLet\u2019s see Donald make America great again now\u201d \u2014 an obvious reference to the president. McCain then went back on his pledge. His lone vote was the one that saved Obamcare, but he had his revenge. For his part, Bush was only a tad more subtle. He described McCain as a man who \u201crespected the dignity inherent in every life \u2013 a dignity that does not stop at borders and cannot be erased by dictators.\u201d According to the Associated Press, the audience, which was filled with media and political elites, even applauded as though this were a campaign rally, as opposed to a funeral for a legitimate war hero and long-term senator. Many of those watching at home were disgusted by the politicization of a man\u2019s death, and used social media to comment on the irony-filled and inappropriate spectacle of elites using a funeral service (of all places) to attack others over partisanship and a lack of decency. The applause was even worse. On social media, the reaction was mostly one of shock and sadness at the lack of self-awareness, as opposed to the bitterness that emanated from the Washington National Cathedral:    https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/1035923137047613441        Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

      "author": "Virgil",
      "content": " Here\u2019s how The Washington Post set the scene: Trump was absent and his name never invoked, but the entire service was animated by a sustained rebellion against the president\u2019s worldview and his singular brand of politics. \u201cWe gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness,\u201d she said, gritting her teeth through the tears. \u201cThe real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.\u201d Okay, we get it: Ms. McCain hates Trump so much that she has to grit her teeth when she talks about him.\u00a0 Trump and his supporters already knew that, of course. And as an aside, we might note that the good news is that in making her hatred so evident, Ms. McCain surely kiboshed any chance that Arizona Governor Doug Ducey would appoint her to fill her father\u2019s senate seat, as some\u2014even some who bill themselves as conservative\u2014have suggested. Meghan McCain speaks at a memorial service for her father at the Washington National Cathedral, September 1, 2018. (SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) However, even if the younger McCain will never be an Arizona Republican, she can still be a Establishment Republican. \u00a0You see, she is an expert in telling the Establishment what it wants to hear\u2014and the Establishment will hugely reward her for her \u201ccourage.\u201d\u00a0 Once again, the Post, that reliable reflector of Beltway conventional wisdom, sets the scene: When she fiercely declared that \u201cthe America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great,\u201d the generals, senators, former presidents and other world leaders who filled the pews burst into applause. We might linger over those last words: \u201cburst into applause.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s worth recalling that this was supposed to be a funeral service, and yet Ms. McCain turned it into a kind of political rally for the Establishment and for what it sees as the \u201cgood old days.\u201d\u00a0 Ah, for the good old days of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mitt Romney, George W. Bush, and \u2026 John McCain.\u00a0 The days when the Establishment, for sure, was great\u2014or at least greatly in charge. From left: former President George W. Bush, former first lady Laura Bush, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne, and former Vice President Al Gore. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Former President Barack Obama speaks at a memorial service for John McCain. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Yes, in the Establishment\u2019s collective mentality, the good old days were the time when the U.S. border was open, when trade deals were easy, and foreign wars were being fought. The Establishment, of course, never cared that, as a result, social chaos was increasing, wages were declining,\u00a0 regions were de-industrializing, and young Heartlanders\u2014not Establishmentarians, of course\u2014were getting killed and maimed overseas.\u00a0 So when Meghan McCain defined those days as \u201cgreatness,\u201d well, that was what the Establishmentarians came to hear. \u00a0 She was patting the big shots on the back, and they were glad for the pat.\u00a0 And John McCain, of course, was the champion of that sort of Beltway bonhomie\u2014and, especially, the bipartisan \u201cfun\u201d of foreign wars. Except when he was running for re-election in Arizona, McCain made no apologies for any of his views, even as they ultimately drove down his approval rating, among Arizona Republicans, to just 20 percent\u2014with a whopping 68 percent disapproving.\u00a0 Indeed, according to another poll, McCain was the third-most unpopular Senator in the nation. Yet to the Establishment, such unpopularity is a badge of honor; that is, if a political figure is willing to \u201cstand up\u201d to the dopey masses, well, that\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0 So it\u2019s little wonder that John McCain received the John F. Kennedy \u201cProfile in Courage\u201d award, that annual liberal smug-fest.\u00a0 And now, maybe Meghan McCain will win it, too. Indeed, Ms. McCain won extra points with the Establishment by snubbing Sarah Palin. The former Alaska governor had been John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2008, and had delivered what\u2019s commonly regarded as the greatest vice presidential acceptance speech in modern memory. So if the McCain-Palin ticket lost in \u201908, it certainly wasn\u2019t her fault. And yet to the Establishment\u2014including the many McCain campaign staffers who now make their living on MSNBC\u2014Palin was hopelessly deplorable. She was too much the populist and no kind of elitist. So by not inviting Palin to the service, the McCains made it clear that they wanted nothing to do with the Deplorables, now and forever. Thus we see that class warfare is alive and well within the Republican Party\u2014assuming, that is, that the McCains still think of themselves as Republicans at all. On Twitter, observers made smart points. For instance, Kurt Schlichter compared the McCain service to the October 2002 memorial for the late senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN).\u00a0 While campaigning for re-election, Wellstone had died in a plane crash, and that was a sad thing\u2014and yet the memorial service turned into a raucous Democratic political rally, and in the resulting backlash, the Republican candidate, Norm Coleman, won the November 2002 election. Meanwhile, a parody account called \u201cStephen Miller\u201d quipped, \u201cDonald Trump wasn\u2019t invited to John McCain\u2019s funeral, because Republican presidents are usually not invited to Democrat campaign rallies.\u201d Yet Virgil was particularly struck by a string of tweets from Michael Tracey, an independent journalist of notable independence: This funeral was one last demonstration of McCain\u2019s belief in \u201cbipartisanship\u201d for its own sake.\u00a0 It almost doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re doing, as long as you\u2019re \u201cworking together.\u201d\u00a0 Just so happens that McCain\u2019s primary \u201cbipartisan\u201d initiative was endless war. That seemed like a funeral not so much for McCain, but for an ideology which had once sustained America\u2019s imperial hegemony, and is now on the way out.  Some of those last few words deserve a second look: \u201cSeemed like a funeral not so much for McCain, but for an ideology which had once sustained America\u2019s imperial hegemony, and is now on the way out.\u201d Tracey\u2019s argument is that McCain-style \u201cneoconservatism,\u201d which can be summed up as invade the world, invite the world, is now a goner. \u00a0While the Establishment\u2014including plenty of Democrats\u2014loves it, most Americans don\u2019t. In fact, it\u2019s not surprising that imperial grandiosity plays well in blue Washington, DC, and in New York City; after all, it\u2019s fun to get rich and noble from imperialism.\u00a0 What\u2019s less fun is to be a legionary from some red state, slogging it out in a hostile land, all for the sake of someone else\u2019s ideological empire.

(U.S. Department of Defense/The National Security Archive) Air Force Major Terry Dutcher visits the grave of her son, Army Corporal Michael Avery Pursel, who died serving in Iraq in 2007 at age 19. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The America people, of course, have always had the power to put a stop to all this grandiose globalism, if\u00a0and when they choose to exercise that power at the ballot box. Finally, in 2016, they did.\u00a0 That was the story of Donald Trump, who romped through the Republican primaries, and then to the White House. And it was also the story of the 2016 Democratic primaries, when Sen. Bernie Sanders nearly defeated Hillary Clinton for the nomination.\u00a0 (Interestingly, Sanders was also not in attendance for the McCain service, although, of course, Hillary was there; she was sitting right by another foreign-war enthusiast, Dick Cheney.) \u00a0 Moreover, since 2016, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that the populist anti-Establishment rebellion is continuing, in both parties. So yes, Tracey has a point: The Establishment will cheer for Meghan McCain, and its handmaidens in the MSM were happy to make the whole of last week into a McCain Mediathon.\u00a0 And yet at the same time, the Establishment is deathly afraid that it can\u2019t put the old humpty-dumpty back together.\u00a0 It fears that the American people won\u2019t get fooled again; no more will they let themselves get conned by the neocons.\u00a0 John McCain really is gone. In fact, watching the McCain services, Virgil was reminded of another famed memorial service for doomed royalty\u2014this one for real royalty, back in 1910.\u00a0 In that year, Britain\u2019s King Edward VII passed away, and all the crowned heads of Europe came to London to pay homage.\u00a0 History buffs will recall that 1910 was just four years before the beginning of World War One; that disastrous conflict, of course, spelled the end of many of those royal dynasties, as well as the actual murder of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and much of his family.\u00a0 Thus Edward VII\u2019s funeral is remembered as a kind of Indian Summer for that earlier imperial era. Here\u2019s how the famed historian Barbara Tuchman described the moment in her classic study of the of origins of World War One, The Guns of August: So gorgeous was the spectacle on the May morning of 1910 when nine kings rode in the funeral of Edward VII of England that the crowd, waiting in hushed and black-clad awe, could not keep back gasps of admiration. In scarlet and blue and green and purple, three by three the sovereigns rode through the palace gates, with plumed helmets, gold braid, crimson sashes, and jeweled orders flashing in the sun.\u00a0 After them came five heirs apparent, forty more imperial or royal highnesses, seven queens\u2013four dowager and three regnant\u2013and a scattering of special ambassadors from uncrowned countries.\u00a0 Together they represented seventy nations in the greatest assemblage of royalty and rank ever gathered in one place and, of its kind, the last. The muffled tongue of Big Ben tolled nine by the clock as the cortege left the palace, but on history\u2019s clock it was sunset, and the sun of the old world was setting in a dying blaze of splendor never to be seen again. Those last words deserve another look: But on history\u2019s clock it was sunset, and the sun of the old world was setting in a dying blaze of splendor never to be seen again.

(Wikimedia Commons) The ceremonial pomp and circumstance of 1910 would soon be displaced by the un-ceremonial blood and mud of 1914, and 1915, and 1916, and 1917, and 1918.\u00a0 By the time the Great War was over, 10 million were dead\u2014and dead, too, was any confidence that the royals knew what they were doing, or that they were to be trusted with any sort of power.\u00a0 It was the end, for sure, of that establishment. 1914, Great Britain: Members of the Royal Fusiliers marching off to war at the start of World War One.

(Topical Press Agency/Getty Images) It seems to Virgil that a similar ending is happening now.\u00a0 The American Establishment might know, down deep, that it has screwed up in its hubris\u2014although, of course, that can never be admitted publicly.\u00a0 Can\u2019t show weakness to the proles! Nevertheless, the Establishment is visibly growing nervous.\u00a0 In its jitteriness, it is clapping wildly, and inappropriately, for those who still hold to the fading faith\u2014such as the McCain family. Yet most of all, the Establishment is raging against the dying of the light.\u00a0 Amidst the hot lights and the hot rhetoric of the McCain funeral-turned-festival, the elites know that this is their political twilight and that dusk is giving way to nightfall. And yet Establishmentarians fear, most of all, that a new and different sun is rising.",

And all of this happened at the most inappropriate venue imaginable: a funeral. There is only one way to describe what we witnessed over the last few days. Basically, in front of the whole world, we watched those who piously lecture the rest of us about decency, decorum, and civility, bare their sorry asses. And this baring of elite asses did not happen at just any funeral. The passing of the legendary Aretha Franklin and war hero John McCain\u2026 These should have been unifying events, a time for America to come together to practice the traditions that unite us, to engage in the kind of unified civic behavior our Apostles of Decency claim to lament the loss of. If nothing else, this was their opportunity to show us Trumptards how it\u2019s done\u2026 Watch us unite the country! Watch us lead by example! Watch us be the change we want! But what did they do instead? Pulled their pants down. And this happened for only one reason: Trump doesn\u2019t just live in their heads \u2014 he\u2019s in there blasting Chuck Berry, banging Playboy Bunnies in threes, wolfing down cheeseburgers, and accomplishing what they never could: making America great again. Over at Instapundit, Glenn Reynolds puts it best: \u201cOne of Trump\u2019s major accomplishments has been to reveal the lack of civic virtue and self-control across our elite institutions.\u201d Trump has forced them to reveal who they really are. May I be honest? Am I allowed to be honest in the age of CorrectThink? Please do argue with me if you disagree, but if the media reports are true, was it not John McCain himself who set the childish tone with his mean-girl invite list? Apparently, he spent eight months planning his own funeral, which was,\u00a0to begin with, \u2014 am I allowed to say it? \u2014 just a tad ostentatious. But to snub a sitting president, to snub Sarah Palin, his unfailingly loyal 2008 vice presidential running mate? What was that other than petty and childish? If I wanted Trump to look bad, I would have invited him to my funeral in the hope he would make himself look bad. If the man is as boorish as our Ruling Class says, why not be the bigger man, even if you are hoping to set him up? But someone who did make McCain\u2019s invite list was credibly accused rapist and perjurer Bill Clinton. And on the invite list at Aretha\u2019s funeral was that same credibly accused rapist and perjurer Bill Clinton, who shared the front row dais with raging racist and anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan, anti-Semite Al Sharpton, and Jesse \u201cHymietown\u201d Jackson. This was the least of it, though. The behavior at both of these funerals was so cheap, so crass\u2026 And all of it on national television. To begin with, in a fit of mean-spiritedness that beggars belief, the McCains obviously invited Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared to humiliate them, to force them to sit there as Meghan McCain and former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush\u00a0took cheap shots at Ivanka\u2019s father. Worse still, while a war hero\u2019s national funeral was turned into a bitter and divisive campaign rally, a cathedral full of elites cheered. Meanwhile, over at Aretha\u2019s funeral, the very same people teeing off on Trump ogled Ariana Grande and then groped her breast and then \u2014 no joke \u2014 made a joke about Grande being a \u201cnew something at Taco Bell.\u201d These are the people lecturing us about decency, y\u2019all. All I could think of was The Masque of the Red Death\u00a0or, as \u201cVirgil\u201d put it, \u201cthe Establishment is raging against the dying of the light [and] know that this is their political twilight[.]\u201d Trump\u2019s accomplishments are not only making fools of establishment elites; his accomplishments are goading establishment elites into making fools of themselves.

John McCain (R-AZ)\u00a0included wide-ranging criticism of President Donald Trump, though he was not named, inspiring the left-wing media to describe the event as the \u201cbiggest Resistance meeting yet.\u201d",
      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": " That wording was used in the headline for a column in the New Yorker published\u00a0on Saturday\u00a0about the service that praised those who slammed the president and implied the gathering was filled with people who are determined to resist the agenda Trump was elected by the American people to advance: Donald Trump\u2019s name was never mentioned. It didn\u2019t have to be. The funeral service for John Sidney McCain III, at the Washington National Cathedral, on this swampy Saturday morning, was all about a rebuke to the pointedly uninvited current President of the United States, which was exactly how McCain had planned it. New Yorker columnist Susan Glasser noted the obligatory tributes to McCain\u2019s \u201cbravery, courage and public service\u201d and his time as a prisoner of war. The column continued: But McCain knew that would not be the headline from the grand service, whose many details he personally oversaw. This was to be no mere laying to rest of a Washington wise man, nor just another funeral of an elder statesman whose passing would be marked by flowery words about the end of an era. It was a meeting of the Resistance, under vaulted ceilings and stained-glass windows. Glasser praised McCain\u2019s daughter, Meghan, for mocking Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign slogan. \u201cThe America of John McCain does not need to be made great again, because it is already great,\u201d McCain said. Glasser said McCain\u2019s eulogy was \u201cremarkable\u201d and then went on to cite a critical White House pool report about Trump\u2019s tweets and mocked his wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and golf-playing. Glasser wrote about McCain planning his\u00a0memorial, including his exclusion of Trump and requests that former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush speak. Glasser wrote: When Bush talked about McCain\u2019s dedication to America\u2019s leadership in the world and his hatred of tyrants, how many of those listening thought of the current President\u2019s praise for many of those same dictators whom McCain had been so proud to oppose? Of course, they thought of it. That was the point. Glasser praised Obama\u2019s jabs at Trump, too, oblivious\u00a0to the irony that while he and others were praising McCain and his civility, they were being blatantly disrespectful to the sitting President of the United States. \u201cThe city is much more bipartisan, in some respects, than it has ever been, more united than it may currently seem, in its hatred of Donald Trump,\u201d Glasser wrote and then named all of those associated with the president who attended the memorial, including his daughter and son-in-law, as another way to rebuff Trump\u2019s presidency. National Public Radio (NPR) also joined the McCain resistance-themed memorial in its reporting. NPR\u2019s\u00a0Weekend Edition Sunday host, Melissa Block,\u00a0introduced the report by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s been a weekend of remembering old Washington \u2014 a place of principled disagreement, honesty and respect. At least that\u2019s the romantic myth and at John McCain\u2019s funeral yesterday that was also the reality.\u201d Reporter Mara Liasson repeated the \u201cresistance\u201d label by the left-wing media in covering McCain\u2019s memorial service. \u201cOne writer said the gathering at the cathedral was a giant meeting of the resistance,\u201d Liasson said.

      "content": " Listening to failed politicians hijack the funerals of two such respected American heroes as John McCain and Aretha Franklin so they could smear the sitting president really tells you all you need to know about those washed-up has-beens. It was particularly strange to listen to all these rabid enemies of McCain in life heaping praise on him in death. Hard to see how both could be possible. But when it comes to low-down, dirty, dishonest gutter politics in America, nothing is out of bounds. Somehow these people are shocked \u2014 SHOCKED! \u2014 by the harsh rhetoric of President Trump. Give me a break. And now these people are lining up to smear yet another good person dragged into the sewer of American politics. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Democrat, went on one of the Sunday shows to shred the good name of Mr. Trump\u2019s latest nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh. (I will not say the name of the program because, honestly, I am embarrassed to have wasted precious moments of the Sabbath on such sleepy-eyed nonsense.) Anyway, she claims to have read 148,000 documents that reveal Judge Kavanaugh to be so heinous as to be unfit for the high court. OK, let\u2019s say Ms. Klobuchar spent two minutes reading each document. That would be 296,000 minutes \u2014 or 205 days \u2014 reading these documents. Which is pretty remarkable considering Judge Kavanaugh was nominated 55 days ago. There is another word for this. It is called a \u201clie.\u201d And the person who utters it is known as a \u201cliar,\u201d even if the person she tells this \u201clie\u201d to is so sleepy-eyed as to appear to be fully asleep. But this isn\u2019t even the most astonishing part of Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s sewer dive on national television. She goes on to say that as horrific as all these documents reveal Judge Kavanaugh to be, she is not allowed to share the documents with the American people. She is not even allowed to tell us what they say. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell you about them right now on the show,\u201d she told her sleepy-eyed interlocutor, who gazed back, sleepily. So, at this point, I am starting to think Mr. Kavanaugh is a racist, child-molesting serial killer. I mean, even Pope Francis would boot this guy out of the church clergy. If only we could see these devastating top secret memos! Well, it turns out, Ms. Klobuchar cannot tell the truth even about the secrecy of these devastating memos that reveal Judge Kavanaugh to be so unworthy that we innocent taxpayers are not allowed to see. Last month, Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, and Judiciary Committee chairman asked Democrats on the committee to identify any of the classified records they thought might shed light on Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s record. Only one Democrat \u2014 Ms. Klobuchar \u2014 took Mr. Grassley up on his offer. She asked for 12 records to be made public. All were. There was no indication in them, however, that Judge Kavanaugh is a racist, child-molesting serial killer. Still, Ms. Klobuchar is voting against his nomination to the Supreme Court. And continues to peddle dishonest political smut from supposedly secret documents that nobody can see. But when Judge Kavanaugh dies, Ms. Klobuchar will be sure to seize the national limelight and deliver a glowing eulogy. \u2022\u00a0Charles Hurt can be reached at\u00a0churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via\u00a0@charleshurt.",

The full Senate is expected to formally affirm Inhofe\u2019s selection this week. \u201cI am deeply honored that my colleagues have selected me to lead the Armed Services Committee,\u201d Inhofe said in a statement. \u201cAmerica is facing new and unprecedented threats that are different from anything we\u2019ve seen before. As chairman, it will be my priority to address these threats while maintaining a staunch commitment to service members and their families, as well as continue the bipartisan tradition of rigorous accountability and oversight of the Defense Department,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to working with Ranking Member [Jack] Reed and the entire committee as we continue to ensure our military is ready and able to defend America against growing threats from around the world.\u201d The move will make Inhofe the first chairman from Oklahoma.\u00a0He has served on the committee since 1995. Inhofe, although a strong supporter of Trump, shares the former chairman\u2019s hawkishness against adversaries Russia, China and Iran. He led a Senate delegation to Poland earlier this year to visit U.S. troops and meet with officials. \u201cBy visiting with our troops and partners in the region, it confirmed the importance of strengthening our diplomatic and military presence in Eastern Europe to counter Russia\u2019s increasing reach and influence. I look forward to working with the Trump Administration to advance our ties even further,\u201d he said the trip in May. Inhofe opposed the Iran nuclear deal, and applauded reimposing sanctions on Iran after Trump pulled out of the deal. Like Trump, he also believes in NATO burden sharing, stating earlier this year: \u201cPresident Trump is right to strongly encourage all of our NATO allies to meet their commitment to defense spending under the collective security obligations.\u201d He has said he believes the Afghanistan strategy is working, but that the United States needs to \u201cremain clear-eyed\u201d about Pakistan\u2019s \u201ccontinued support for the Taliban.\u201d He has applauded the Trump administration\u2019s tougher approach to China, and is a strong supporter of providing Taiwan with the newest defense equipment, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\u00a0He has also been a strong supporter of Trump\u2019s diplomatic efforts with North Korea. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), fellow member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement Thursday: \u201cWhile I will deeply miss the friendship and leadership of the late Senator John McCain, I am pleased to see Senator Inhofe serve as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. As a fellow Army veteran, I know Senator Inhofe has the experience and tenacity to lead and prioritize the needs of our servicemembers. \u00a0I congratulate Senator Inhofe and look forward to working with him in his new role as the leader of a committee that is vital to our national defense.\u201d This story has been updated with a statement from Ernst.",

      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": " But in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle ahead of this week\u2019s confirmation hearings for Kavanaugh, John Yoo, the man who wrote the memo granting that presidential authority, said the judge, if confirmed, would not be a puppet manipulated by President Donald Trump. The Chronicle reported on Yoo\u2019s \u201cunusual vantage point\u201d on Kavanaugh, including being a longtime friend and former Yale Law School classmate of the judge, a lifelong Republican, and someone who did not vote for Trump. While the loudest and most passionate arguments at the confirmation hearings will be over abortion rights, the debate over presidential power could have more immediate ramifications. That debate could someday determine the fate of President Trump, as the investigation into whether his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia grinds on toward a possible showdown in the courts. Yoo, 51, is best known for his willingness to stretch Oval Office power to its most lethal limits. When he worked in the Department of Justice in the months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Yoo wrote a legal memo that President George W. Bush\u2019s administration used to authorize what it called \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d techniques such as waterboarding on terror suspects in U.S. custody. Many \u2014 including the late GOP Sen. John McCain \u2014 called those techniques torture. Some still think Yoo should be prosecuted as a war criminal for crafting the memo. Protesters still heckle Yoo wherever he speaks. He remains unapologetic, believing that the president has broad powers to act in the name of national security. \u201cI love it. I love that they hate me,\u201d Yoo said in the Chronicle article. The Chronicle article points out Kavanaugh\u2019s critics worry that he would somehow protect Trump from any legal consequences he might face. \u201cYoo said people shouldn\u2019t worry about Kavanaugh going easy on Trump,\u201d the Chronicle reported. \u201cI would bet money \u2014 a lot of money, actually \u2014 that Kavanaugh would say that the president doesn\u2019t have any immunity,\u201d Yoo said, for things he did before he became president, including answering a subpoena from Special Counsel Robert Mueller in the alleged Russian collusion investigation. \u201cI would expect Kavanaugh to uphold that, too,\u201d Yoo said. Yoo, who is now a law professor at University of California at Berkeley, is still critical of Trump and said he cannot predict how the president would react to dealings with the Supreme Court should he become the center of a case under its review. The Chronicle article concludes that elections have consequences. And in the case of Kavanaugh, it most likely means Trump seating at least two justices on the highest court in the land.

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " These awful people are really, really, really hoping to con prospering Americans into believing something as meaningless as a management style is some sort of national emergency. While Trump continues to make the kind of sound decisions that (among many other things) have turned around our economy, put two superb justices on the Supreme Court (Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation seems secure), reigns in Putin and North Korea, and have all but wiped out ISIS, all these sore losers, grifters, and left-wing liars have to attack him with is his unorthodox management style. What they do not want you focused on, especially with the midterm elections weeks away, are the unprecedented results of Trump\u2019s \u201cchaotic\u201d management style, results that have lowered black and Hispanic unemployment to record levels, brought manufacturing back to the Rust Belt, and made the endless War on Terror feel like a bad memory. This week was especially bad for the crybabies. As Trump racked up a successful confirmation hearing for Kavanaugh and the kind of economic news the media assured us was no longer possible, the pitiful and certifiably insane Resistance went shark jumping on at least nine occasions\u2026 Al Sharpton, Stevie Wonder, and others used the occasion of a funeral \u2014 a funeral! \u2014 to trash Trump while peacocking as our moral and intellectual superiors, but they did so in the company of credibly accused rapist and perjurer Bill Clinton and rabid racist and anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan. Oh, and after singer Ariana Grande was hit with a Taco Bell joke, she was groped. There they were, all of America\u2019s fading media and political elite, hectoring and lecturing the rest of us about how awful it is to divide people, about how crude Trump is\u2026 And these classless rubes did this at a church funeral. But this happened only after John McCain himself used his own funeral to create a mean-girl invite list meant to fulfill his dying grudges with petty snubs \u2014 including Sarah Palin and a sitting president. But we are supposed to believe Trump is the childish and mean-spirited one. And then there were the Arbiters of Decency in the audience, those who applauded this divisive rhetoric in the National Cathedral, as if to prove once again they are, in fact, much more vulgar, boorish, and crude than any of their intended targets. Again, another shallow attack on Trump\u2019s management style, and one with no allegations of wrongdoing. What we have here is just another grift, another chapter in the long con, another attempt to concoct a national crisis over something as stupid and shallow as palace intrigue. SIDE NOTE: My original title for this piece was going to be \u201cEven if Everything in Woodward\u2019s Book Is True, I Don\u2019t Give a Shit.\u201d George Papadopoulos, a former low-low-low-low level Trump campaign hanger-on, the man we are told is the key to the media\u2019s collapsing Russian Collusion Hoax, will serve 14 days in prison for lying to authorities. Fourteen days! Great job, Mueller. In the meantime, Hillary Clinton, James Comey, John Brennan, and James Clapper are allowed to run free and wild, even though a credible case can be made that all committed perjury. Papadopolous is such a snorer, the far-left CNN scheduled an \u201cexclusive\u201d interview with him for late on a Friday night. America\u2019s lecturer-in-chief returned to the campaign trail Friday to lie about Trump and have a tantrum over the fact he is not receiving credit for Trump\u2019s many successes. Obama actually claimed Trump did not condemn the Nazis and racists at Charlottesville, although he clearly did so on at least two occasions. Obama also tried to gaslight us into believing Trump\u2019s roaring economy had nothing to do with Trump, even though Trump is accomplishing things Obama said were only possible with a magic wand. Then Obama lied about his treatment of the media, with the claim he never went as far as Trump. The truth, however, is Obama went much, much further. While Trump criticizes and mocks the media, Obama weaponized the Department of Justice to spy on, intimidate, and declare the media unindicted co-conspirators. Naturally,\u00a0proven liars and conspiracy theorists, like CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter, still swooned over and used fake news to cover up for their Precious Barry. Some un-American narcissist published a column in the far-left New York Times to brag that he and a dark cabal of unelected, unaccountable Deep Staters are actively working to sabotage a duly elected president\u2019s agenda. But again, there are no allegations of wrongdoing on Trump\u2019s part, just phony hand-wringing over his management style. At first, the corrupt media cheered this brave whistleblower, until they realized he had just confirmed everything Trump and his supporters have said about the existence of the Deep State\u2019s festering Swamp. In a bitter and meandering op-ed for the far-left Atlantic, Meet the Press host Chuck Todd declared war on media critics, especially those working at Fox News whom he claims are responsible for getting Trump elected and the media\u2019s unprecedented integrity and trust problems. Todd also compared media critics to southern segregations, which is fake news because all of those segregationists were Democrats, just like Chuck Todd. Nowhere did Todd suggest that maybe-possibly-perhaps other things were contributing to the media\u2019s credibility problems \u2014 like countless fake news scandals, op-eds like the one Todd just wrote, and his own employer, the left-wing NBC, which\u00a0covered up TWO credible rape allegations against powerful Democrats. The highlight of the Democrat Party\u2019s norm-busting, pathetic, and disgusting attempts to stop the Judicial Committee hearings for Trump\u2019s insanely qualified Supreme Court nominee was, without a doubt, Sen. Booker\u2019s ridiculous \u201cSpartacus\u201d moment \u2014 which ended up being more of a George Costanza moment. At first, Sen. Shameless Liar claimed he was \u201cSpartacus\u201d for risking his Senate career to make public a couple of confidential documents. Turned out it was all a\u00a0hoax. The documents had already been approved for public release, and Spartacus knew it. Booker also acted like he was Perry Mason, running into chambers with the smoking gun to save the day to defeat the eeeevil Kavanaugh, when all Booker held were nothingburgers. This incompetent boob wants to be president? On his Friday night HBO show, far-left comedian Bill Maher ignored the half-dozen or so Democrat women who claim they were groped by disgraced former Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) to smear as a liar the one woman who actually has a photo of Franken groping her \u2014 Leann Tweeden. Maher wants Franken to run against Trump in 2020. My guess is that Maher witnessed how horribly presidential hopefuls Booker and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) performed this week during the Kavanaugh hearings and is now willing to look the other way at alleged sexual misconduct if that\u2019s what it takes to bring Trump down. Remember, only Al Franken can\u00a0Make America Handsy Again. \u2014 Meanwhile, in the real world, in the world outside of this manufactured bubble where Trump\u2019s management style means he is not \u201cfit to be president,\u201d we are out here enjoying real wage growth, real job growth, real peace, and real prosperity. And the only thing we find unsettling and worthy of the word \u201ccrisis\u201d is this increasingly desperate and dishonest attempt to overturn a presidential election because a bunch of losers can\u2019t deal with a duly elected president\u2019s style. All I know is that the results of Trump\u2019s style are making America great again, are proving just how horribly this country has been managed by the failed Establishment for the last 30 years, and all y\u2019all can kiss my ass.",

Shields said,\u00a0\u201cI think there are two factors that contribute to Trump\u2019s trouble. First, I think the McCain funeral and its attendant attention was just a reminder of a hero, of military service, and Donald Trump\u2019s total tone-deafness during that entire week. I think the contrast is in people\u2019s minds. Anybody who is a veteran, knows a veteran, has a veteran in the family, respected military service, I think had to look at it and just be \u2014 recoil from his performance.\u201d He added,\u00a0\u201cThe second thing is, I think, quite frankly, his tweeting is wearing thin. I think it\u2019s lost its freshness. I mean, when you tweet two dozen times about the national anthem and the NFL \u2014 he did have an ability almost to drive the political narrative.

Biden said at the University of Pennsylvania: I think you\u2019re going to see a significant change in the politics of the country, and I think lot of it had to do with the way in which the administration has treated people. I think the nail that maybe have put in the coffin this time was the way in which the administration responded to John McCain\u2019s death, and the way it came across as being so nakedly\u2026 almost un-American. It was just raw. It wasn\u2019t \u2014it\u2019s not who we are. The Establishment was up in arms after President Trump marked McCain\u2019s passing with a sole tweet, which read: \u201cMy deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!\u201d  The president then drew grumbles for lowing the White House flag at half-staff on Saturday\u00a0\u2014 the day of the Arizona\u00a0senator\u2019s passing\u00a0\u2014 and raising it on Sunday. On Monday, the White House flag was once again lowered to half-staff, followed by the signing of\u00a0a proclamation ordering flags across the country to be lowered to half-staff. \u201cDespite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain\u2019s service to our country and, in his honor, have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment,\u201d President Trump said in a\u00a0commendatory statement. Biden\u00a0delivered an emotional\u00a0eulogy\u00a0at\u00a0McCain\u2019s\u00a0memorial service, describing the late-lawmaker as a dear friend who cared little about politics, despite\u00a0serving decades in the Senate and making multiple presidential bids. \u201cHe could disagree on substance, but the underlying values that animated everything John did, everything he was, come to a different conclusion,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cHe\u2019d part company with you if you lacked the basic values of decency, respect, knowing this project is bigger than yourself.\u201d Flanked by United Kingdom Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Biden also criticized President Trump\u2019s approach to matters of foreign policy. \u201cThe worst thing in the world we can have is this new naked nationalism, America first.

John McCain, who when he ran for president, his motto was \u201cCountry First,\u201d and that\u2019s what this should be about.\u201d WATCH:  Throughout the debate, Donnelly framed himself as independent-minded, noting his support for a majority of President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominees.

In explaining his opposition to Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Donnelly described the allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh as \u201ccredible.\u201d Braun\u2019s campaign released a statement declaring victory in the debate following its completion: Tonight, Hoosiers saw a clear contrast between career politician Joe Donnelly and job creator Mike Braun.\u00a0\u00a0While Mexico Joe tried to hide his record of profiting from his family business that outsourced Hoosier jobs south of the border and his vote against Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mike Braun outlined his record of creating American jobs and his vision to work with President Trump to create Hoosier jobs.\u00a0This November, Hoosiers have a clear choice between a liberal career politician in Senator Donnelly and Mike Braun who has real solutions to move Indiana forward. Indiana went for Trump in 2016\u2019s presidential election, winning 56.9 percent of the vote to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 37.8 percent. Ballotpedia describes Indiana as reliably Republican in presidential elections: Between 1900 and 2016, Indiana cast votes for the winning presidential candidate\u00a070\u00a0percent of the time. In that same time frame, Indiana supported Republican candidates more often than Democratic candidates,\u00a083.33\u00a0to\u00a016.67\u00a0percent, making it one of the most reliably Republican states in the country. Indiana favored Republicans in every presidential election between 2000 and 2016 except for 2008, when\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0(D) narrowly carried the state with 49.9 percent of the vote. The latest RealClearPolitics average of polls has Donnelly holding a 2.5 point lead over Braun among Indiana residents. Morning Consult\u2019s latest estimate has Trump holding a 50 percent approval \u2014 and 46 percent disapproval \u2014 in Indiana. The debate did not feature any questions about immigration, legal or illegal. Also absent were questions related to international trade.",

      "subtitle": "The nation is mourning the passing of President George H.W. Bush, one of the greatest Americans. In the voluminous tributes that have appeared in the media since Friday evening, Bush has been appropriately honored for his lifetime of public service and his legacy \u2014 most of all, perhaps, his large and loving family, equally devoted to the nation he led.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " President Bush \u2014 \u201cBush 41\u201d or \u201cBush senior,\u201d as he was later called, to distinguish him from his son, George W. \u2014 should be remembered for three great accomplishments. The first is his heroism in the Second World War, when he was among the country\u2019s youngest naval aviators, and survived being shot down by the Japanese over the Pacific. The second milestone was when, as president, Bush oversaw the end of the Cold War. Though the collapse of the Soviet Union was a result of the policies of his predecessor, President Ronald Reagan, and the fall of the Berlin Wall initially took the White House by surprise, President Bush seized the moment to welcome the world\u2019s newest free peoples. The third success was the Gulf War, when Bush inspired the nation to overcome the lingering self-doubt of the Vietnam War and to trust once again in the U.S. military \u2014 a trust that has never wavered since. He was also a fundamentally decent man, who \u2014 unlike others \u2014 set aside political disagreements to insist,\u00a0before his death, that President Donald Trump attend his funeral. Yet the media obscured many of Bush\u2019s achievements and qualities when he was still an active political leader. In the 1992 presidential election, for example, the media portrayed Bush as a man hopelessly out of touch with his time. In one of the earliest examples of \u201cfake news,\u201d the New York Times reported that President Bush had been \u201camazed\u201d by the technologies of modern supermarkets. It was a lie. It was only years later that the media discovered that Bush had not been just a one-term president, but also one of the better presidents in American history. They developed a newfound respect for Bush for three reasons. The first reason was that he proved to be a useful media foil against his son during the debate over the Iraq War. Conveniently, many of the elder Bush\u2019s advisers were opposed to the new, more assertive national security policies of the U.S. after the terror attacks of 9/11. The Iraq Study Group, led in part by former Secretary of State James Baker, was cast as a kind of paternal intervention \u2014 which, to George W. Bush\u2019s credit, he rejected, backing a successful \u201csurge\u201d rather than a hasty withdrawal (a victory Barack Obama later squandered). The second reason for the revival of Bush\u2019s reputation was that he came to symbolize an alternative to conservatism in general. After all, it was Bush who, as a rival for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980, first called Reagan\u2019s supply-side policies \u201cvoodoo economics.\u201d That once proved fodder for Reagan\u2019s critics. Later, the fact that Bush\u00a0voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 provided ammunition to Trump\u2019s opponents, and to the anti-Trump media. As president, while Bush nominated Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who remains a staunch conservative, he also chose David Souter, who became the archetypal example of a Republican appointee defecting to the left. Crucially, Bush alienated conservatives by infamously reneging on his \u201cno new taxes\u201d pledge. \u201cConservatives in his party never trusted him again,\u201d Time recalled Saturday, praising Bush for doing \u201cthe right thing.\u201d Bush\u2019s retreat on taxes hurt his support among the Republican base in 1992, and he faced a primary challenge from Pat Buchanan as a result. Some of his voters also chose Ross Perot instead. That led to the third, and most important, reason the media elevated Bush: he lost to Bill Clinton. It is the same reason they celebrated the late John McCain as a hero after demonizing him to defeat in the 2008 presidential election. To the media,\u00a0the highest civic duty of a Republican is to yield power to a Democrat, so that the \u201clong arc of history\u201d may continue bending towards utopia. No Republican who wins will ever be given his or her due. George H.W. Bush always deserved better from the American media \u2014 and his example of service, unsullied by politics, will continue to inspire the nation he loved. Joel B.

      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " Mansour said, \u201cIt seems as if the media is already using [George H.W. Bush\u2019s] passing as a means to bash President Trump, just as they did with the funeral of John McCain. \u2026 What lessons do you think Trump could learn from Bush 41?\u201d Malkin replied, \u201cThere are not many I can think of that I might frame in a positive way, and I absolutely agree with you that we\u2019ve seen from the senility mongers of the left the usual vulgar [and] vile behavior.\u00a0Is there a dead Republican body that the Democrats and the left won\u2019t use to go after Trump? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d LISTEN:  Malkin continued, \u201cThe lesson of the Bush regime and the Bush dynasty is something that impoverishes the American worker. It grows the deep state at the expense of small businesses and liberty, and even though the grocery scanner story turned out to be fake news, as Dan Rather once said in defense of his fake news, \u2018It was fake\u00a0but accurate.'\u201d Malkin added, \u201cThe elitism of the Bush wing of the [Republican] party is what Trump defeated, and I think [Donald Trump] has to remember that\u2019s why he\u2019s in the office \u2014 because of the adamant rejection of that attitude and those policies.\u00a0I\u2019m distressed that once again, we have these open borders amnesty Bush Republican Party-type business as usual tactics in dealing with the border wall funding. They\u2019re going to wait \u2019til the Friday before Christmas? This is disgraceful.\u201d Malkin reflected on YouTube\u2019s censorship of a 2006 video she produced critiquing Islamic terrorism while discussing broader political censorship technology companies such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter imposed. \u201cI first established [my] website in 1998 and 1999, and I think one of the smartest moves I ever made was maintaining my independent eponymous site\u00a0because I think it really represents the spirit of the best of what citizen journalism and the blogosphere is about,\u201d said Malkin. \u201cEspecially with all the crackdowns that are occurring and that Breitbart especially has been covering so well, we\u2019ve all lived this: the banning, the shadowbanning, the censorship. For me, it goes back to 2006 when one of my earliest videos critiquing jihad \u2014\u00a0 a tiny little two-minute homemade video I put together called \u2018First They Came\u2019 \u2014 was yanked by YouTube as \u2018hate speech.\u2019 That was 2006. In so many ways, so little has changed, but I wonder: Glenn Reynolds \u2014 one of the early godfathers of the blogosphere \u2014 quit Twitter last week in the wake of some of the latest suppression of conservative and independent voices. I wonder if there\u2019s an opportunity for a renaissance, back to the golden era of conservative blogging in the blogosphere, if people are just tired of the easy click-bait and shallow coverage. Maybe people want to read things again, so I\u2019ve always got my blog.\u201d After Mansour described Malkin as \u201cone of the godmothers of new conservative media,\u201d Malkin heralded her relationship with Breitbart News: \u201cThe other part of that ethos is the sense of camaraderie that so many independent sites have, and that\u2019s why in large part, after all of these years, I still appreciate the friendship and alliance that I have with you all at Breitbart. it goes back. It\u2019s O.G.\u201d Earlier on Monday, Malkin announced her departure from CRTV, headed by Mark Levin, following the news media outlet\u2019s declared forthcoming merger with Glenn Beck\u2019s The Blaze.

      "subtitle": "Whatever you might think of the Bush dynasty\u2019s legacy, no one can ever accuse the family of not showing class and decency.",
      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " And their sterling example of this, while saying goodbye to their beloved patriarch, has also served as an important reminder of just how awful the McCain family is. Remember when Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) died? How could you forget? The funeral lasted longer than the first season of Cop Rock \u2014 something like nine episodes. McCain died on a Saturday, and his funeral services did not come to an end until the following Sunday, but only after it had toured three different cities. George H.W. Bush died on Friday and his services will end on Thursday. Both men were legitimate war heroes, but only one was a U.S. president. Although illuminating, that is the least of it. President Bush\u2019s funeral has been lovely, classy, unifying, and loving. There have been no cheap snubs, no axe grinding from the grave. The Bush family\u2019s simple and decent act of burying the hatchet with President Trump, their patriotic act of making the president (and by extension his supporters) feel welcome and honored at these services, that is true patriotism, and that is what American democracy is supposed to be about. What\u2019s more, because of this, as sad as it all is, the funeral has been a healthy and uplifting national event, a rare time in these bitter days when all Americans have come together, an important reminder that, despite our differences, we do share a common culture and decency. And it is also, by way of comparison, another reminder that the McCain funeral was something closer to an obscenity. By far, the worst part of McCain\u2019s going-away grudgefest was the clown show of audacious hypocrisy, the slathering sanctimony found in a theme that begged for us to go back to the good old days when people were civil with one another \u2014 and yet, all of this tripe about \u201ccivility\u201d was coming from those who used a war hero\u2019s funeral to snub and bash everyone who is not a member of their elitist establishment club \u2014 including, unforgivably, the president of the United States. The catty, childish snubbing of the president is unforgivable, not because Donald Trump was snubbed, but because the office of the presidency was snubbed. That office represents We the People, and no matter who occupies that office, be it Barack Obama or Trump, when you shit on the president you shit on the people, and that is just how awful the McCain family is. And then there were the so-called eulogies, most of which were reprehensible acts of narcissistic exploitation. On one hand, you had eulogies being used as score-settling tirades against Trump and his supporters, and on the other you had those like Meghan McCain \u2014 the deceased\u2019s own child, for God\u2019s sake \u2014 using her eulogy to up her media profile, to create a YouTube moment, to reassure the same hideous media that personally destroyed her father during his 2008 presidential run, that she is one of them. \u201cThe America of John McCain does not need to be made great again, because it is already great,\u201d the hideous Meghan said. I mean, she really said that \u2014 at a funeral \u2014 her father\u2019s funeral. Everything about McCain\u2019s funeral proved just what a shallow, grasping, insecure, and small family this is. Among other things\u2026 Publicly snubbing the American president. Publicly snubbing Sarah Palin, his ever-loyal 2008 running mate. Choosing pallbearers to take a jab at Trump. Eulogies full of cheap-shot applause lines. Funeral attendees applauding the mean-spirited partisanship as though they were at a rally. John McCain\u2019s funeral was twisted into something bitter and un-American, something disgraceful and petty. The New Yorker aptly described it as \u201cthe biggest resistance meeting yet.\u201d\u2018 \u201cTwo ex-Presidents and one eloquent daughter teamed up to rebuke the pointedly uninvited Donald Trump, the New Yorker wrote, adding, \u201cThe funeral service for John Sidney McCain III, at the Washington National Cathedral \u2026was all about a rebuke to the pointedly uninvited current President of the United States, which was exactly how McCain had planned it.\u201d What a disgrace, and every decent person knew at the time it was a disgrace. But through their act of common courtesy, humanity, dignity, and modesty, the Bush family once again reminded us of who they really are and who the McCains really are. Too soon? Is it too soon to tell the truth about the McCains? You know what, I don\u2019t care if it is too soon. I am sick and tired of being told what I can and cannot say, and I am really sick and tired of being emotionally blackmailed into not telling the truth. So there it is \u2026 and you all know I\u2019m right. May God bless and keep President George H.W. Bush and his family. And may God forgive John McCain and his.

      "subtitle": "In testimony before the House Judiciary and House Oversight Committees, former FBI Director James Comey made numerous assertions that are seemingly at odds with other statements he made during the course of the same testimony.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " Comey also made claims that raise questions about his actions as FBI director or are contradicted by information presented by others. Breitbart News reviewed the full transcript of Comey\u2019s testimony last Friday. Below, in no particular order, are five problematic aspects to claims made by the embattled former FBI director. 1 \u2013 Comey says that the FBI\u2019s Russia collusion investigation was not initiated by the anti-Trump dossier financed by Democrats. Yet earlier in the same testimony, he states that he doesn\u2019t remember the \u201cfactual predicate\u201d that launched the FBI\u2019s investigation, and he cannot recall ever seeing the bureau\u2019s initiation document that officially started the probe. Here is where Comey stated twice that the dossier did not launch the probe: QUESTION: Director Comey, do you agree with Mr. Baker (former FBI counsel James Baker) that the initial allegation in the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence operation into the Trump campaign\u2019s potential coordination with the Russian Government, quote/unquote, had nothing to do with the Steele dossier? Mr. Comey: Yes. That\u2019s correct \u2026 QUESTION: Mr. Comey, was the FBI\u2019s investigation into Russian interference and potential coordination with the Trump campaign started by a fraudulent dossier? Mr. Comey: It was not. Mr. Deutch: Can you explain how you know that? Mr. Comey: Because I know what the basis was for starting the investigation. It was the information we\u2019d received about a conversation that a Trump foreign \u2014 campaign foreign policy adviser had with an individual in London about stolen emails that the Russians had that would be harmful to Hillary Clinton. It was weeks or months later that the so-called Steele dossier came to our attention. While Comey conveys certainty that the dossier was not involved in launching the probe, he earlier stated that he doesn\u2019t \u201cremember precisely\u201d the \u201cfactual predicate\u201d that led to the FBI\u2019s investigation. He made those comments here: Mr. Gowdy: Director Comey, can you tell us the factual predicate that may have led to the launching of that counterintelligence investigation? Mr. Comey: I don\u2019t think that I can describe the factual predicate for two reasons: I don\u2019t remember precisely; and to the extent I remember, I think those are classified facts that implicate the concern the Bureau just expressed. Comey also repeatedly stated that he cannot recall ever reading the FBI\u2019s initiation document that launched the probe. 2 \u2013 Comey claimed he \u201cdid not know for sure\u201d how Steele\u2019s dossier reached the FBI. Yet John McCain repeatedly stated that he personally hand delivered the dossier directly to Comey. It is true that McCain delivered the dossier to the FBI after the agency reportedly obtained it earlier by other means, but Comey\u2019s direct involvement in later receiving the dossier raises questions about the veracity of his statements. \u201cHow did Chris Steele\u2019s information reach the FBI?\u201d Comey was asked generally. The question did not refer to any specific time period. \u201cI don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d Comey answered. \u201cI have some recollection that he passed it to an agent that he knew and that that agent sent it on to headquarters. I think that\u2019s the way in which it reached the Counterintelligence Division, but I don\u2019t remember the specifics of that.\u201d In a book published earlier this year, The Restless Wave, McCain, the late Arizona senator, wrote that he gave Steele\u2019s dossier to Comey on Dec. 9, 2016. In October 2017, McCain also said that he gave Steele\u2019s material to the FBI. \u201cI gave it to no one except for the director of the FBI. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re digging this up now,\u201d McCain\u00a0told\u00a0the Daily Caller during what the news website described as a testy exchange. A reporter had asked McCain whether he was the source who provided the dossier to BuzzFeed News. The founders of the controversial opposition research firm Fusion GPS previously admitted that they helped Steele share the document with McCain. While he was alive, McCain\u2019s office never responded to repeated queries from Breitbart News asking whether McCain knew that the information he delivered to Comey was actually an opposition document reportedly funded by Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. It is unclear why McCain would feel the need to get the dossier to the FBI leadership a few weeks after the November 2016 election. According to numerous\u00a0reports\u00a0and Capitol Hill testimony, the FBI immediately took Steele\u2019s information seriously when the ex-spy reportedly provided his anti-Trump claims to a contact at an FBI field office in Rome in July 2016. Mother Jones\u00a0reported that a \u201cfew weeks\u201d after Steele went to the FBI on his own in July, \u201cthe bureau asked him for information on his sources and their reliability and on how he had obtained his reports.\u201d \u201cHe was also asked to continue to send copies of his subsequent reports to the bureau,\u201d\u00a0Mother Jones\u00a0reported. \u201cIn other words, by the end of the July, the leadership of the FBI was paying attention,\u201d the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported. Not only were they paying attention, the BBC\u00a0reported\u00a0that Steele\u2019s information served as a \u201croad map\u201d for the FBI\u2019s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. The dossier reportedly served as part of the FBI\u2019s justification for seeking the FISA court\u2019s reported approval to clandestinely monitor the communications of Carter Page, the American oil industry investor who was tangentially and briefly associated with Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. 3 \u2013 Comey says that prior to signing a FISA application to obtain a warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, the embattled former FBI director was aware that the Steele dossier was financed by Democrats who opposed President Donald Trump. Yet according to Democratic and Republican House Intelligence memos, that information was not specifically included in the FISA application, which in part relied on Steele\u2019s work to obtain warrants to monitor Page. In the testimony, Comey was asked about his knowledge of Steele\u2019s political patrons. Comey stated: I thought he was retained as part of a Republican-financed effort \u2014 retained by Republicans adverse to Mr. Trump during the primary season, and then his work was underwritten after that by Democrats opposed to Mr. Trump during the general election season. \u201cWhen did you learn that his work went from being financed by what you described as Republicans to what you described as Democrats?\u201d Comey was asked. The former FBI director was also asked whether he learned about political actors financing Steele \u201cbefore there were any court filings\u201d \u2014 a clear reference to the FISA application, which Comey first signed in late October 2016. Comey replied: \u201cI certainly learned of it before the end of October. And I think the filing that you\u2019re referring to obliquely was at the end of October sometime. So, it was before that.\u201d Comey\u2019s FISA application to conduct surveillance did not specifically state that the FBI had information that Steele was being paid in connection with any U.S. political party, according to House documents. A House Intelligence Committee\u00a0memo\u00a0released last February documented that as FBI director, Comey signed three FISA applications to spy on Page with the dossier serving as part of the basis for the warrant requests. \u201cNeither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele\u2019s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior and FBI officials,\u201d the memo states. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee\u00a0released a rebuttal of the House memo that confirms\u00a0the key contention that the FBI and DOJ both failed to inform the FISA court that Steele\u2019s dossier was funded by Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm. The Democratic memo quotes a footnote from the FISA application, which says that Steele: was approached by an identified U.S. person who indicated to Source #1 [Steele] that a U.S.-based law firm had hired the identified U.S. person to conduct research regarding Candidate #1\u2019s ties to Russia. (The identified U.S. person and Source #1 have a long-standing business relationship.) The identified U.S. person hired Source #1 to conduct this research. The identified U.S. person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into candidate #1\u2019s ties to Russia.\u00a0The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign. That footnote was further confirmed when the Trump administration released a redacted version of the FISA applications last July. The statement in Comey\u2019s FISA application that \u201cthe FBI speculates\u201d that Steele \u201cwas likely looking for information that could be used to discredit\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign is a far cry from informing the court that the dossier utilized in the FISA warrant was paid for by Trump\u2019s primary political opponents, namely Clinton and the DNC. 4 \u2013 Comey repeatedly stated in the testimony that he \u201cnever\u201d knew Steele had been retained to do his work by U.S.-based law firm Perkins Coie. Yet the FISA warrant to spy on Carter Page signed three times by Comey stated the FBI had information that Steele had been hired by a \u201cU.S.-based law firm.\u201d It specifically stated the FBI \u201cwas approached by an identified U.S. person who indicated to Source #1 [Steele] that a U.S.-based law firm had hired the identified U.S. person to conduct research regarding Candidate #1\u2019s ties to Russia.\u201d Comey made his remarks during testimony on Friday. Here is a transcript of the relevant portions of Comey\u2019s latest testimony as it relates to Perkins Coie: Mr. Gowdy: When did you learn that Fusion GPS was hired by Perkins Coie? Mr. Comey: I never learned that, certainly not while I was Director. Mr. Gowdy: Well, when did you learn the DNC had hired Perkins Coie? Mr. Comey: I never learned that. Again, while I was Director. I think I\u2019ve read it in the media, but, yeah, even today, I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s true. \u2026 Mr. Gowdy: While you were the Director, you never knew that the DNC hired a law firm that hired an oppo research firm that hired Christopher Steele? Mr. Comey: No, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t have any recollection of being told that or reading that or learning that while I was Director. Comey was not asked to explain how he could sign three FISA warrants stating that Steele was hired by a \u201cU.S.-based law firm\u201d yet claim not to know Steele was hired by Perkins Coie, which was working for Clinton and the DNC. Later in the testimony, a skeptical Mark Meadows (R-NC) asked Comey to explain his claim that he didn\u2019t know Steele was being paid via Perkins Coie considering testimony from Comey\u2019s own former legal counsel, FBI official James Baker, that Baker was contacted by an attorney for Perkins Coie and was provided with documents related to the Russia probe. Here is the relevant portion of that testimony: Mr. Meadows: Let me ask one clarifying question, if you don\u2019t mind. Director Comey, you were saying that you had no knowledge that Perkins Coie was actually involved with the Democrat National Committee and involved in this particular investigation that ultimately was initiated. Is that correct? Mr. Comey: I, when I was FBI Director, don\u2019t remember ever being told anything about Perkins Coie. I think I\u2019ve since read stuff in the media, but not when I was Director. Mr. Meadows: So are you saying that James Baker, your general counsel, who received direct information from Perkins Coie, did so and conveyed that to your team without your knowledge? Mr. Comey: I don\u2019t know. Mr. Meadows: What do you mean you don\u2019t know? I mean, did he tell you or not? Mr. Comey: Oh, I \u2014 well \u2014 Mr. Meadows: James Baker, we have testimony that would indicate that he received information directly from Perkins Coie; he had knowledge that they were representing the Democratic National Committee and, indeed, collected that information and conveyed it to the investigative team. Did he tell you that he received that information from them? And I can give you a name if you want to know who he received it from. Mr. Comey: I don\u2019t remember the name Perkins Coie at all. 5 \u2013 Comey agreed with Democratic assessments that disgraced former FBI agent Peter Strzok proved he was not motivated by partisan politics because he was one of only a few people who knew about the investigation into Russian collusion and yet never leaked the details to the news media. Later in the same testimony, however, Comey said a main reason the investigation was not made public was because \u201cwe didn\u2019t know whether we had anything,\u201d implying the FBI could look bad if it released information to the public without evidence to back up the investigation. He also said informing the public could hamper the investigation. Speaking of Strzok, Comey said \u201cit\u2019s hard for me to see how he was on Team Clinton secretly at that point in time.\u00a0 And he also was one of the handful of people in the entire world who knew we were investigating four Americans who had some connection to Mr. Trump during the summer of 2016, and he didn\u2019t tell a soul. So it\u2019s hard to reconcile that with his being on Team Clinton.\u201d Later in the same testimony, Comey provided motivations for not going public related to credibility: QUESTION: Why wouldn\u2019t you have announced that? Mr. Comey: Well, for a number of reasons. It would \u2014 there wouldn\u2019t be any policy exception that would permit it; that is, it would jeopardize the ongoing investigation and it would be brutally unfair because we didn\u2019t know whether we had anything. We literally just started. And as I said, by the time I was fired, we still hadn\u2019t come to a conclusion. And so we\u2019d be revealing something that was inherently misleading and jeopardizing our ability to investigate by revealing it. It\u2019s for that reason \u2014 I actually don\u2019t remember any discussion about whether to reveal that we had these classified counterintelligence files. Instead, what we debated a lot was should we tell the American people that the Russians are messing with our election more broadly.

Glenn Simpson of political intelligence firm Fusion GPS handed McCain\u2019s office the documents they had contracted Steele to compile.

      "subtitle": "In a stunning blow to the establishment wing of the Republican Party, President Donald Trump ally Kelli Ward\u2013a two-time Senate candidate in Arizona\u2013has pulled off a surprise victory by ousting the chairman of the state party and taking over.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " Ward said in a statement following her surprise win: I am deeply humbled and honored to have the support of so many of our party\u2019s state committeeman. I want to thank Chairman Lines for his service and commitment. One of my top priorities as chairman is to unify our party so we enter 2020 at full strength. Together, we will ensure a resounding victory for President Trump and Arizona Republicans up and down the ballot. Our party\u2019s future is bright.  Ward ousted the establishment-backed incumbent state GOP chairman Jonathan Lines on Saturday, as state party committeemen chose her over Lines\u2013a decided move by the rank-and-file of Arizona\u2019s GOP to go with a bolder leader for the party heading into the critical 2020 presidential election. Arizona Republicans have been rankled by divisions in recent years. The late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), whom Ward challenged in 2016, had been overtly critical of President Trump in his final years of life. McCain\u2019s fellow Arizona Senator, now former Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ)\u2013whom Ward also ran against before he dropped out and decided against seeking re-election\u2013had also been aggressive in criticism of Trump. When McCain passed away, former Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) was temporarily appointed to his slot in the Senate and Ward faced off against then-Rep. Martha McSally (R-AZ) in the GOP primary in a bid to face then-Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) in the general election for Flake\u2019s senate seat. McSally won the primary, but lost the general election\u2013the first time a Republican has lost a statewide race in Arizona in years, as Democrat Sinema moved on to the U.S. Senate. Nonetheless, McSally was appointed to McCain\u2019s old U.S. Senate seat anyway after Kyl announced his intentions to leave the chamber again,as he had only intended to serve as a caretaker for the slot. Ward has been close with Trump over the years. Back in 2017, when she was running against Flake before Flake dropped out, Trump praised her on Twitter:  It\u2019s hardly the only time Ward and Trump have been close together. The fact that a Democrat, Sinema, could win statewide in Arizona has Republicans worried going into 2020, especially with changing demographics in the state. Arizona\u2019s 11 electoral votes are critical to a winning formula for any Republican nominee, especially for the re-election of President Trump. In 2016, Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton spent critical time in the closing days of the campaign in Arizona attempting to flip the state her way. While she was unsuccessful, Republicans fear that Sinema\u2019s defeat of McSally could turn Arizona into a major battleground state\u2013instead of a reliable red one\u2013in 2020, forcing Trump to spend time, money, and resources there that he would rather spend in places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Colorado, or other states he could make a major difference in. Democrats have also been trying to flip other red states like Texas and Georgia their way, coming close in U.S. Senate and governor\u2019s races respectively in both states in 2018. Democrat Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke nearly toppled Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) in Texas, but came just short, and in Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams nearly defeated the now Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, in that gubernatorial contest. The move by Arizona\u2019s GOP party faithful away from the establishment way of thinking that cost Republicans key elections, and back towards Trump\u2019s combative style as personified by Ward, is a major sign of the direction Republicans at state levels nationwide want to go in heading into 2020. What\u2019s more, Ward becoming the new chair of the Arizona GOP may be awkward for the same GOP establishment that tried to wipe her out in previous elections in her two runs for the U.S. Senate. \u201cWard\u2019s ouster of Lines also raises questions about the state party\u2019s relationship in the near future\u00a0with the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the\u00a0National Republican Congressional Committee,\u201d the Arizona Republic wrote about her surprise win.",

MEGHAN MCCAIN:\u00a0The first thing I have to say is that I\u2019m surrounded with support. Everywhere I go, somebody has an antidote\u00a0they want to tell me about my dad and it\u2019s a gift to have that because he\u2019s always present in me, he\u2019s clearly present in a lot of other people\u2019s lives, as well.\u00a0I try not to feel bad for myself, because I just don\u2019t, I think he would be terribly pissed if I walked around that way, anyway. But, I learned that grief is a very toxic taboo subject. It makes people very uncomfortable, and I am almost five months out since he passed, and I\u2019m sad every single day. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with sharing that. I have moments where I think that I just can\u2019t do anything anymore without him, and it\u2019s a weird place to be in, in so many different ways. As a daughter, I\u2019m grieving and I\u2019m sad. As an American, I hate this country without him in it. I know that sounds awful. I don\u2019t hate America but I just hate it without his leadership. And, I\u2019m very sad all the time, and I\u2019m struggling with that sadness. I miss him in ways I never could have even fathomed, and then I try and say \u201cWhat would my dad say?\u201d He\u2019d say \u201cWe are McCains and we don\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves, and we\u2019re blessed. Get up and keep fighting, Meghan.\u201d That\u2019s what I kind of do every day, and some days are better than others. JONES: You\u2019re not the only person missing John McCain. This vacuum is so pronounced because of this wall, the shutdown, all this sort of stuff. I\u2019m hearing now that you\u2019re saying, you\u2019re not really calling yourself a Republican anymore. MCCAIN: I call myself a conservative. I\u2019m still a member of the Republican Party. I still vote on the Republican ticket., butt Republicanism is so tied up with being for Trump. But, I\u2019m also not a Never Trumper. Trump didn\u2019t melt my brain. I can still see the forrest from the trees and didn\u2019t exsponge all my conservative principles out of me.\u00a0Our friend S.E. Cupp, women like us are trying to navigate this right now because I understand Trump supporters, I understand why they voted for him. I also understand why people think he\u2019s tearing this country apart and the end times are coming. There was a blood-red moon a few days ago. Apparently it\u2019s a symbol of the end of the world, and I was like \u201cwell, seems about right.\u201d Honestly, I\u2019m just trying to survive in a lot of different ways and politically as well right now. To me, when I grew up, conservativsm and character, my father was like really, really, I would say, militant about character. And now it seems like lying, well, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s a little nebulous. Stealing, it\u2019s a little nebulous. I just don\u2019t think those are American characteristics.

John McCain (R-AZ) during lunch with TV anchors and then spoke of\u00a0bipartisanship\u00a0during his State of the Union address. McCain said, \u201cWhat was hard for me last night, I was prepping and getting ready and reading my notes beforehand and I get a notice that President Trump had a meeting with the network heads and he had called senator Chuck Schumer a nasty son of a bitch, Joe Biden dumb, said some disparaging things once again of my father who passed five and a half months ago. So for me when he\u2019s talking about \u2018we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution,\u2019 you aren\u2019t being bipartisan mere hours earlier obsessing over people you consider your enemies. So for me it was a kabuki theater, virtue signal, the entire speech last night towards his base, but please don\u2019t sit here and tell me you are grasping for bipartisanship at this moment when Chuck Schumer as a son of a bitch and my father\u2019s book \u2018bombed\u2019 and Joe Biden is \u2018dumb.\u2019\u201d Co-host Joy Behar added, \u201cHow pathetic do you have to be to go after somebody who is dead.

I apologize if anything else I have said on this matter distracts from \u2018if you see something, say something,\u2019\u201d McCain tweeted.  McCain, a staunch anti-trafficking advocate, apologized after Phoenix authorities pushed back against her claim in a Monday interview with KTAR News 92.3 FM that she stopped a human trafficking attempt. \u201cIf you see something, say something. That very thing happened to me at the Phoenix airport last Friday,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI came in from a trip I\u2019d been on and I spotted \u2014 it looked odd \u2014 it was a woman of a different ethnicity than the child, this little toddler she had, and something didn\u2019t click with me.\u201d \u201cI went over to the police and told them what I saw and they went over and questioned her and, by God, she was trafficking that kid,\u201d she added. \u201cShe was waiting for the guy who bought the child get off an airplane.\u201d But Phoenix police said McCain\u2019s account of the events was inaccurate and found no human trafficking had occurred.

      "content": " On June 16, 2015, Trump announced he was running for president, and within two weeks, McCain was smearing Trump as racist. \u201cI just disagree with his comments about the, quote, Mexicans,\u201d he said at a June 30 town hall event. Trump said nothing in reply. Ten days later, McCain again smeared Trump as a racist, and this time did so on, of all places, MSNBC. \u201cI just think that it is offensive to not only Hispanic citizenry, but other citizenry, but he\u2019s entitled to say what he wants to say,\u201d McCain told the far-left news outlet on July 11. \u201cBut I guarantee you the overwhelming majority [in Arizona] \u2026 do not agree with his attitude, that he has displayed, toward our Hispanic citizens. We love them.\u201d McCain, of course, is referring to Trump\u2019s announcement speech where the future president referred to the type of people the Mexican government is looking to be rid of through that country\u2019s cynical border policy. \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us,\u201d Trump explained. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d Trump was specifically talking about who the Mexican government was looking to be rid of, not the Mexican people or Mexican illegal aliens in general. But by pretending otherwise, McCain was joining the media by deliberately taking Trump out of context, and on July 11, the day after McCain\u2019s MSNBC appearance, Trump finally hit back. \u201cWe have incompetent politicians, not only the president,\u201d Trump told\u00a0thousands of his supporters at a rally in Phoenix. \u201cI mean, right here, in your own state, you have John McCain. I\u2019ve supported John McCain, but he\u2019s very weak on immigration\u2026 If the right person runs against John McCain, he will lose.\u201d Pretty tepid stuff from Trump, especially in light of McCain\u2019s dishonest determination to smear him as a racist. Five days later, on July 16, McCain hit back, this time in the far-left New Yorker, \u00a0and again he crossed the line by referring to Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201ccrazies.\u201d \u201cThis performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me,\u201d McCain said. \u201cBecause what he did was he fired up the crazies\u2026 Now he galvanized them. He\u2019s really got them activated.\u201d To recap: At this point, McCain has attacked Trump\u2019s supporters as dangerous racists and smeared Trump as a racist, and did so by deliberately taking him out of context. It was only at this point that Trump did what Trump does \u2014 went for the throat. In a July 16 tweet, Trump demanded an apology from McCain for the \u201ccrazies\u201d remark, and in a follow-up tweet wrote, \u201cMcCain should be defeated in the primaries. Graduated last in his class at Annapolis\u2013dummy!\u201d Two days later Trump went for the full ballbreak with his well-publicized remarks referring to McCain\u2019s service record. Trump said, \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d But the myth fabricated by the establishment media is that Trump started all of this, or at the very least, that it was Trump who first removed the gloves. That myth is a lie, a shameless lie that refused to die even after what happened next. At this point, Trump laid off McCain even as the famous grudge-holder continued to rip Trump as sexist and anti-Muslim. And while McCain offered his grudging support for Trump after the billionaire clinched the GOP nomination, McCain made a big deal out of refusing the attend the nominating convention. Still, Trump attempted to make peace with his tormentor in May of 2016. \u201cYou know, frankly, I like John McCain, and John McCain is a hero. Also\u00a0heroes are people that are, you know, whether they get caught or don\u2019t get caught, they\u2019re all heroes as far as I\u2019m concerned. And that\u2019s the way it should be,\u201d Trump told radio host Don Imus. What\u2019s more, Trump endorsed McCain\u2019s 2016 re-election with these gracious words: \u201cI hold in the highest esteem Sen. John McCain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office. And I fully support and endorse his reelection.\u201d McCain, however, kept grinding away in the most underhanded of ways. Sometime during the campaign, McCain played a key role in furthering the Russian collusion hoax. Then, on October 8, McCain revoked his support for Trump after the Access Hollywood tape hit the airwaves. Worse still, after Trump won the presidency, in July of 2017, McCain forced the entire country to stew in his bitterness when he betrayed a longstanding oath made to his country by voting against the repeal of Obamacare. \u201cLet\u2019s see Donald make America great now,\u201d \u00a0he reportedly told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). Even as the brain cancer began to steal away his life, McCain lashed out at Trump by refusing to invite the sitting president to the funeral. Nevertheless, despite all of this, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump still graciously accepted an invitation to attend John McCain\u2019s funeral. What\u2019s more, this graciousness continued after the funeral, even after the hideous McCain family turned the nationally televised event into a pathetic anti-Trump rally, into a national obscenity. The above context is crucial if you are to understand just what a petty, vain, vicious, and cruel person Meghan McCain is. Plopped on Stephen Colbert\u2019s couch Thursday night, Monstrous Meg sucked up to the left-wing comedian by publicly trashing Jared and Ivanka for graciously accepting that invitation. She even tried to make it sound as though they had crashed the funeral without an invitation, when we all know no one was there without a family invitation. Monstrous Meg added that she hoped her opportunistic anti-Trump eulogy made the couple \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t actually think about who would be attending the funeral, strangely,\u201d McCain said unconvincingly. \u201cThe answer is no, I did not know [Jared and Ivanka] would be attending his funeral. \u2026 I thought that my family had made it clear, or at least I had, that the Trumps are unwelcome around me\u2026 So I was surprised when they were there.\u201d \u201cIt made me uncomfortable,\u201d she added, \u201cand I hope I made them uncomfortable, honestly, with everything.\u201d But in her defense, is this really Monstrous Meg\u2019s fault? What are we to expect from a spoiled dilettante raised by a hateful man who would rather stick it to his own country than honor his longstanding promise to repeal Obamacare? What are we to expect from an entitled princess raised by a woman who racially profiles interracial families, reports them to the authorities, and then publicly lies about them engaging in human trafficking because her life is so empty she needs to feel like a hero for ten minutes on a local radio show? Yes, Meghan McCain is a terrible person, but she never really had a chance. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.",

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": "  The Civitas poll of 500 likely voters in North Carolina with a margin of error of 4.38 percent shows Trump beating four different leading Democrat contenders. Trump leads former Vice President Joe Biden 43 percent to 39 percent, a four percent lead, but has bigger leads over Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT), an independent self-described socialist who caucuses with Democrats and has announced he is seeking the Democrat nomination for president in 2020. The survey was conducted from Feb. 11 to Feb. 13, and was released on Wednesday. Both Booker and Harris are officially in the race, and Sanders joined them this week. Biden has yet to make a decision. Trump\u2019s North Carolina lead over Booker in this poll is by eight percent, with Trump at 44 percent and Booker down at 36 percent, while Trump\u2019s lead over Harris is by 11 percent with Trump at 45 percent and Harris at 34 percent. Over Sanders, Trump leads by 12 percent in North Carolina\u2013with the president at 46 percent and Sanders at 34 percent. \u201cNational Democrats are on the cusp of the grueling journey to pick their party frontrunner. This is a journey that Republicans can likely empathize with, as they found themselves in a similar situation in 2016,\u201d Civitas President Donald Bryson said in a release announcing the poll results. \u201cRight now, President Trump is likely benefitting from a higher name ID, while at the same time, voters tend to be shy of supporting candidates they view as undefined.\u201d The Republican National Convention in 2020 is going to be in Charlotte, North Carolina, where Trump will all but certainly be re-nominated as the GOP nominee for president as he seeks re-election to a second term in the White House. North Carolina\u2019s 15 electoral votes, just as critical to Trump\u2019s path to re-election as they were for his 2016 win over Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton, are in the mix and up for grabs, as whoever wins the Democrat nomination is likely to push to try to flip the state back to the Democrats. Democrats have not won North Carolina since the 2008 presidential election, when now former President Barack Obama defeated GOP nominee then-Sen. John McCain\u2013who has since passed away\u2013in the Tar Heel State. In 2012, GOP nominee and now Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT)\u2013the former governor of Massachusetts who later moved to Utah to run for Senate in 2018\u2013beat Obama there, but lost the general election. Trump defeated Clinton in North Carolina in 2016. \u201cNorth Carolina won\u2019t be a cakewalk for any party or candidate, and campaigns are going to have to find new messages or methods to sway moderate voters and soft partisans,\u201d Bryson of Civitas added.",

      "author": "Michelle Moons",
      "content": " \u201cThe most important issue we face is immigration and we need to be talking about it for more than one panel for 20 minutes,\u201d Malkin charged from the CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference) stage. \u201cMy first CPAC in 2002 was to talk about my very first book Invasion which exposed how border failures and systemic non-enforcement of our visa program rules created the national security crisis that led to 9/11.\u201d Immigration was a defining issue in the 2016 election that saw the American people make Donald Trump President of the United States.\u00a0Malkin hailed President Donald Trump \u201cas he battles the Beltway swamp, the deep state, the administrative state, and the fake news fourth estate. But there is no sugarcoating America\u2019s long-term forecast.\u201d Malkin\u2019s Friday address went after members of both political parties and those who seek to \u201cmarginalize and criminalize mainstream conservatives, anti-jihad groups, and immigration hawks as \u201chate groups\u201d and push us out of the public square\u201d like Color of Change and the Southern Poverty Law Center. She also named, \u201cPaul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, the Bush family, Mitt Romney and the ghost of John McCain.\u201d \u201cOur shining city on a hill has become a much-abused doormat to the world. Building the border wall is just half the battle. The numbers tell all. Our future is dimmed. The odds are fearful,\u201d Malkin charged. She referenced the one million given legal permanent resident status in America each year and a predicted increase of 10 million green card holders by 2025. She put the numbers in perspective, \u201cThat\u2019s more than the current combined population of Dallas, St. Louis, Denver, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Atlanta.\u201d \u201cPrinceton University researchers found that recently admitted immigrants sponsored an average of 3.45 additional relatives each,\u201d Malkin said of chain migration. The diversity visa lottery brought another nearly half a million immigrants from fiscal year 2008 to 2017, she explained. \u201cTens of thousands are pouring in from terrorism breeding grounds through the lottery unvetted, unmonitored and unassimilated.\u201d In addition, these lottery winners have brought in \u201cspouses and unmarried children under 21\u201d through chain migration. Malkin had made clear at the top of her speech, \u201cI identify as an American. A proud, unhyphenated, unapologetic, fully assimilated American. My pronouns are U.S.A.\u201d She then launched into visa overstays: \u201cNearly half of all illegal aliens in the country have violated the terms of their short-term visitor or work visas More than 10.8 million people received such visas alone in fiscal year 2015, including 500,000 foreign university and graduate students on academic visas and nearly 700,000 total foreign guest workers (both skilled and unskilled, not to mention their spouses, many of whom are allowed to work here as well). \u201cCongress has repeatedly mandated a nationwide visa entry-exit system to track legal short-term visa holders. But one has yet to be built\u2014even in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which were perpetrated in part by several illegal alien visa overstayers,\u201d said Malkin. \u201cE-verify has been stalled. Sanctuary cities metastasized.\u201d \u201cBOTH parties are to blame \u2013 yeah I\u2019m looking at you, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, the Bush family, Mitt Romney and the ghost of John McCain,\u201d she charged. \u201cOpen borders anarchy, multiplied by endless chain migration, amnesty, and cheap labor pipelines, endangers our general welfare and the blessings of liberty,\u201d Malkin warned. \u201cBy every clear measure, the war is not on immigrants but on American sovereignty.\u201d Michelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News \u2014 follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " History is already revealing him to be one of the worst presidents in history, certainly in my lifetime (and I lived through the Carter years), but that he was a brilliant politician is not in doubt. I\u2019ll never forget the moment I knew Obama would be president. It was right after his Republican rival, Sen. John McCain, lost his ever-loving mind and quit the presidential campaign to go and save the economy. Immediately after McCain jumped on his white horse with nowhere to go, Obama called a press conference. But Obama was cool, you see. In his remarks, he said nothing about McCain. Then he opened things up for questions knowing McCain\u2019s madness would be the first question, and it was, and this is when Obama dropped the nuke: \u201cI think it is going to be part of the president\u2019s job to be able to deal with more than one thing at once.\u2019\u2019 That\u2019s how you win presidential elections. Obama did the same thing to Romney; time and again and again, Obama and his campaign emasculated the former Massachusetts governor. Romney almost constantly allowed himself to be on defense, to look weak and in a crouch. And whenever Romney tried to launch an offensive, he sounded shrill and desperate. Obama was a godawful president, but he played the role of president brilliantly. No question. Now watch the fake Hispanic Beto O\u2019Rourke launch his presidential campaign. The guy\u2019s a spaz, and how awkward is it watching his heiress wife count Beto\u2019s ear hairs:  More spaz-o-rama:  Forget about the drivel coming out of his mouth and watch him: watch Beto\u2019s body language, listen to the world salad\u2026 Obama always came off as calm, collected, No Drama Obama. O\u2019Rourke behaves like a male cheerleader at a college game. He\u2019s the ultimate beta male. And just so no one can accuse me of political bias, Marco Rubio had much of the same problem in 2016. Believe it or not, becoming president has nothing to do with policy, experience, or character or any of that stuff\u2026 Those things are addressed in the primaries. Sure, there are partisans on both sides who will vote for their guy no matter what, but it is still the 15 to 25 percent of the unaffiliated who choose our president \u2014 and going back to John F. Kennedy, to 1960 when television took over the messaging of political campaigns, it is the alpha male who has always won the presidency. By the way, this doesn\u2019t mean a woman can\u2019t become president. \u201cAlpha male\u201d is a figure of speech, shorthand for the poise, command, unflappable, and in charge. Hillary probably would have stomped all over Rubio or John Kasich. Her problem was that Donald Trump beat her soundly in that facet of the campaign. Don\u2019t confuse this observation with a 2020 prediction, an election that will almost certainly be decided in the same way all presidential re-election campaigns are decided \u2014 on the state of the economy. If we hit a recession next year, Boy George could probably beat Trump. What\u2019s more, O\u2019Rourke could toughen up during the primary, work on his presentation\u2026 My only point is that this worshipful comparing O\u2019Rourke to Obama is a more than a tad delusional right now. Yes, they share some of the same qualities, but the key one, the one that wins all the marbles is, to say the least, lacking. Obama was many things, but he was no spaz. Beto is a total spaz.

Maybe spend yours with your family instead of on twitter obsessing over mine?\u201d McCain wrote on Twitter.  The View co-host\u2019s scathing remarks came in response to President Trump\u2019s criticism\u00a0of her late father\u2019s involvement\u00a0in giving the FBI a copy of the largely\u00a0debunked Steele dossier, which purported nefarious ties between the president and Russia. Appearing on the Fox News Channel Saturday, former independent counsel\u00a0Ken Starr said that while McCain\u00a0was an\u00a0\u201cAmerican hero,\u201d if reports of his handling of the dossier are accurate, it would be a \u201cvery dark stain\u201d on his legacy. President Trump quoted Starr\u2019s remark, tweeting: \u201cSpreading the fake and totally discredited Dossier \u201cis unfortunately a very dark stain against John McCain. He had far worse \u201cstains\u201d than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace!\u201d In his autobiography, The Restless Wave,\u00a0McCain wrote of the dossier that he \u201cdid what duty demanded I do\u201d in handing it over to law enforcement.\u00a0\u201cI discharged that obligation, and I would do it again. Anyone who doesn\u2019t like it can go to hell,\u201d he declared. Meghan McCain\u2019s latest remarks follow a series of critical statements about President Trump and his administration. Appearing on\u00a0CNN with host Van Jones in late January, McCain said she hates the United States without her father\u2019s leadership. \u201cAs an American, I hate this country without him in it. I know that sounds awful. I don\u2019t hate America but I just hate it without his leadership,\u201d she said when asked how she was handling her father\u2019s passing. McCain infamously included several jabs at President Trump in her\u00a0eulogy for her father. \u201cWe gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness,\u201d she began. \u201cThe real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly.\u201d In a veiled knock on the president\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign slogan, she added, \u201cThe America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.\u201d In February, McCain discussed with late-night host Stephen Colbert her thoughts on President Trump\u2019daughterer and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, attending her father\u2019s funeral. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually think about who would be attending the funeral, strangely,\u201d McCain told the funnyman. \u201cThe answer is no, I did not know [Jared and Ivanka] would be attending his funeral. \u2026 I thought that my family had made it clear, or at least I had, that the Trumps are unwelcome around me\u2026 So I was surprised when they were there.\u201d \u201cIt made me uncomfortable,\u201d she added, \u201cand I hope I made them uncomfortable, honestly, with everything.\u201d ",

PHILIP RUCKER: Well, I\u2019ll see if I can do that, Nicole. I mean, Trump has been nursing a grudge about John McCain for more than three years now. Go all the way back to the first big controversy\u00a0of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in August of 2015 in Iowa, where Trump made a really flippant remark about McCain saying \u201cI like heroes who weren\u2019t captured\u201d and he got tremendous heat and blowback on that, including from the Republican National Committee and throughout the party establishment, and Trump, instead of apologizing to McCain and commending his war service, just dug in. Every since then, McCain has been sort of a ghost in Trump\u2019s mind, somebody he can\u2019t shake. He was really bothered by that healthcare vote, obviously, but it\u2019s been other things. \u2026 RON KLAIN: I think there\u2019s a personal element and a political element. On the personal side, you know, Meghan McCain says that Donald Trump is not a great man. I would say what we saw this weekend shows that Donald Trump is barely human. I mean, to go after and attack John McCain, a national hero, months after his death, is just, it\u2019s subhuman. It\u2019s not only not befitting a president, it\u2019s not befitting basic common norms of decency, that\u2019s the human aspect of it. From a political aspect, if Donald Trump really wants to relitigate the vote on Obamacare over and over again, my party won a national election in 2018 when the issue was health care, when the issue was whether or not Donald Trump was going to take away people\u2019s coverage for pre-existing condition. Every time Donald Trump wants to sit in the Oval Office and say, \u201cI wish I\u2019d taken away people\u2019s coverage for pre-existing conditions,\u201d that\u2019s a videotape my party would love to see on T.V. every day of the week.",

      "subtitle": "TEL AVIV \u2014 David Kramer, a long-time advisor to late Senator John McCain, revealed that he met with two Obama administration officials to inquire about whether the anti-Trump dossier authored by former British spy Christopher Steele was being taken seriously.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " In one case, Kramer said that he personally provided a copy of the dossier to Obama National Security Council official Celeste Wallander. In a deposition on Dec. 13, 2017 that was recently posted online, Kramer said that McCain specifically asked him in early December 2016 to meet about the dossier with Wallander and Victoria Nuland, a senior official in John Kerry\u2019s State Department. \u201cSenator McCain asked me to meet with both of them to see if this was being taken seriously in the government,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cAnd Senator McCain asked you to meet with them?\u201d Kramer was asked to clarify. \u201cYes, just to see if this was being taken seriously. I think he wanted to do \u2014 this was his kind of due diligence before he went to Director Comey.\u201d Kramer testified that in his conversations with Nuland and Wallander he was told by both of them that each were aware of the dossier and that Nuland \u201cthought Steele was a serious person.\u201d Kramer revealed that he gave a copy of the dossier to Wallander, who was familiar with the contents but did not have a copy. \u201cI had a subsequent conversation with Ms. Wallander in which I gave her a copy of the document. That was probably around New Year\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had not seen it herself until I had shown it to her,\u201d Kramer added. \u201cShe had heard about it. And she didn\u2019t know the status of it.\u201d In the same testimony, the McCain associate revealed that he held a meeting about the dossier with a reporter from BuzzFeed News who he says snapped photos of the controversial document without Kramer\u2019s permission when he left the room to go to the bathroom. That meeting was held at the McCain Institute office in Washington, Kramer stated. BuzzFeed infamously published Steele\u2019s full dossier on January 10, 2017 setting off a firestorm of news media coverage about the document. Prior to his death, McCain admitted to personally handing the dossier to then-FBI Director James Comey but he refused repeated requests for comment about whether he had a role in providing the dossier to BuzzFeed, including numerous inquiries sent to his office by this reporter. In his book published last year, McCain maintained he had an \u201cobligation\u201d to pass the dossier charges against Trump to Comey and he would even do it again. \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t like it can go to hell,\u201d McCain exclaimed. Kramer, meanwhile, also said that he briefed others reporters on the dossier contents, including CNN\u2019s Carl Bernstein, in an effort to have the anti-Trump charges verified. The same day BuzzFeed released the full dossier, CNN\u00a0 first reported the leaked information that the controversial contents of the dossier were presented during classified briefings inside classified documents presented one week earlier to then-President Obama and President-elect Trump. Kramer said that he believed McCain was sought out in order to provide credibility to the dossier claims. \u201cI think they felt a senior Republican was better to be the recipient of this rather than a Democrat because if it were a Democrat, I think that the view was that it would have been dismissed as a political attack,\u201d Kramer stated. The controversial Fusion GPS firm hired Steele to do the anti-Trump work that resulted in the compilation of the dossier.\u00a0 Fusion GPS was paid for its anti-Trump work by Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee via the Perkins Coie law firm. Kramer\u2019s testimony sheds a new light on the role of the Obama administration in disseminating the largely-discredited dossier that was reportedly involved in the FBI\u2019s initial investigation into the Trump campaign and unsubstantiated claims of Russian collusion. Also Comey cited the dossier as evidence in a successful FISA application to obtain a warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, a former adviser to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. The testimony also revealed how McCain was utilized to give the wild dossier charges a credibility boost. Nuland and dossier Nuland\u2019s specific role in the dossier episode has been the subject of some controversy for her. In their book, \u201cRussian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin\u2019s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump,\u201d authors and reporters by Michael Isikoff and David Corn write that Nuland gave the green light for the FBI to first meet with Steele regarding his dossier\u2019s claims. It was at that meeting that Steele initially reported his dossier charges to the FBI, the book relates. Steele sought out Rome-based FBI Special Agent Michael Gaeta, with whom he had worked on a previous case. Before Gaeta met with Steele on July 5, 2016, the book relates that the FBI first secured the support of Nuland, who at the time was assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs specializing in Russia. Regarding the arrangements for Steele\u2019s initial meeting with the FBI about the dossier claims, Isikoff and Corn report: There were a few hoops Gaeta had to jump through. He was assigned to the U.S. embassy in Rome. The FBI checked with Victoria Nuland\u2019s office at the State Department : Do you support this meeting ? Nuland, having found Steele\u2019s reports on Ukraine to have been generally credible, gave the green light. Within a few days, on July 5, Gaeta arrived and headed to Steele\u2019s office near Victoria station . Steele handed him a copy of the report. Gaeta, a seasoned FBI agent, started to read . He turned white. For a while, Gaeta said nothing . Then he remarked, \u201cI have to report this to headquarters.\u201d The book documents that Nuland previously received Steele\u2019s reports on the Ukrainian crisis and had been familiar with Steele\u2019s general work. Nuland faced confirmation questions prior to her appointment as assistant secretary of state over her reported role in revising controversial Obama administration talking points about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks. Her reported changes sought to protect Clinton\u2019s State Department from accusations that it failed to adequately secure the woefully unprotected U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi. Nuland\u2019s name surfaced in a flurry of news media reports last year about the dossier and Kerry\u2019s State Department. Sidney Blumenthal An extensive New Yorker profile of Steele named another former official from Kerry\u2019s State Department for alleged involvement in circulating the dossier. The magazine reported that Kerry\u2019s chief of staff at the State Department, John Finer, obtained the contents of a two-page summary of the dossier and eventually decided to share the questionable document with Kerry. Finer received the dossier summary from Jonathan M. Winer, the Obama State Department official who acknowledged regularly interfacing and exchanging information with Steele, according to the report. Winer previously conceded that he shared the dossier summary with Nuland. After his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with Steele. Winer further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an \u201cold friend.\u201d Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal \u2013 which Winer in turn gave to Steele \u2013 originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals. Nuland, Winer Give Conflicting Accounts There are seeming discrepancies between Winer and Nuland about actions taken involving the dossier. Nuland described in a Politico podcast interview what she claimed was her reaction when she was presented with Steele\u2019s dossier information at the State Department. She said that she offered advice to \u201cthose who were interfacing with\u201d Steele, immediately telling the intermediary or intermediaries that Steele \u201cshould get this information to the FBI.\u201d She further explained that a career employee at the State Department could not get involved with the dossier charges since such actions could violate the Hatch Act, which prevents employees in the executive branch of the federal government from engaging in certain kinds of political activities. In a second interview, this one with CBS\u2019s Face The Nation, Nuland also stated that her \u201cimmediate\u201d reaction was to refer Steele to the FBI. Here is a transcript of the relevant section of her February 5 interview with Susan B. Glasser, who described Nuland as \u201cmy friend\u201d and referred to her by her nickname \u201cToria\u201d: Glasser: When did you first hear about his dossier? Nuland: I first heard \u2014 and I didn\u2019t know who his client was until much later, until 2017, I think, when it came out. I first heard that he had done work for a client asserting these linkages \u2014 I think it was late July, something like that. Glasser: That\u2019s very interesting. And you would have taken him seriously just because you knew that he knew what he was talking about on Russia? Nuland: What I did was say that this is about U.S. politics, and not the work of \u2014 not the business of the State Department, and certainly not the business of a career employee who is subject to the Hatch Act, which requires that you stay out of politics. So, my advice to those who were interfacing with him was that he should get this information to the FBI, and that they could evaluate whether they thought it was credible. Glasser: Did you ever talk about it with anyone else higher up at the department? With Secretary Kerry or anybody else? Nuland: Secretary Kerry was also aware. I think he\u2019s on the record and he had the same advice. Nuland stated that Kerry \u201cwas also aware\u201d of the dossier, but she did not describe how he was made aware. She made clear that she told \u201cthose who were interfacing\u201d with Steele to go to the FBI since any State Department involvement could violate the Hatch Act. Her Politico podcast interview was not the only time she claimed that her reaction was to refer Steele to the FBI. On Face The Nation on February 4, Nuland engaged in the following exchange in which she stated her \u201cimmediate\u201d reaction was to refer Steele to the FBI (emphasis added): MARGARET BRENNAN: The dossier. VICTORIA NULAND: The dossier, he passed two to four pages of short points of what he was finding, and\u00a0our immediate reaction to that was, \u201cThis is not in our purview. This needs to go to the FBI,\u00a0if there is any concern here that one candidate or the election as a whole might be influenced by the Russian federation. That\u2019s something for the FBI to investigate.\u201d And that was our reaction when we saw this. It\u2019s not our \u2014 we can\u2019t evaluate this. And frankly, if every member of the campaign who the Russians tried to approach and tried to influence had gone to the FBI as well in real time, we might not be in the mess we\u2019re in today. Nuland gave the two interviews after her name started surfacing in news media reports involving\u00a0Kerry\u2019s State Department and the dossier. Her name also came up in relation to a criminal referral of Steele to the Justice Department in the form of a\u00a0 letter authored last year by Sen. Chuck Grassley, who at the time chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). The Grassley-Graham criminal referral\u00a0contains\u00a0redacted information that Steele received information from someone in the State Department, who in turn had been in contact with a \u201cforeign sub-source\u201d who was in touch with a redacted name described as a \u201cfriend of the Clintons.\u201d Numerous media reports have since stated that the source of information provided to the State Department that was in turn passed on to Steele was Cody Shearer, a controversial figure tied to the Clintons who is also an associate of longtime Clinton friend Sidney Blumenthal. According to sources who\u00a0spoke to\u00a0CNN, Shearer\u2019s information was passed from Blumenthal to Winer, who at the time was a special State Department envoy for Libya working under Kerry. Winer says that Kerry personally recruited him to work at the State Department. It is Winer\u2019s version of events that seems to conflict with Nuland\u2019s. In an\u00a0oped\u00a0published in the\u00a0Washington Post, Winer identified Nuland as the State Department official with whom he shared Steele\u2019s information. Winer writes that Nuland\u2019s reaction was that \u201cshe felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material.\u201d He does not relate any further reaction from Nuland. Winer wrote in the Washington Post (emphasis added): In the summer of 2016, Steele told me that he had learned of disturbing information regarding possible ties between Donald Trump, his campaign and senior Russian officials. He did not provide details but made clear the information involved \u201cactive measures,\u201d a Soviet intelligence term for propaganda and related activities to influence events in other countries. In September 2016, Steele and I met in Washington and discussed the information now known as the \u201cdossier.\u201d Steele\u2019s sources suggested that the Kremlin not only had been behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign but also had compromised Trump and developed ties with his associates and campaign. I was allowed to review, but not to keep, a copy of these reports to enable me to alert the State Department. I prepared a two-page summary and shared it with Nuland, who indicated that, like me, she felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material. That was the extent of Winer\u2019s description of Nuland\u2019s reaction upon being presented with Steele\u2019s dossier claims. Nuland\u2019s public claim that her \u201cimmediate\u201d response was to refer Steele to the FBI since State involvement could violate the Hatch Act seems to conflict with the only reaction that Winer relates from Nuland \u2013 that she felt Kerry should be made aware of the dossier information. In Winer\u2019s Washington Post oped, he writes that Steele had a larger relationship with the State Department, passing over 100 reports relating to Russia to the U.S. government agency through Winer. Winer wrote that Nuland found Steele\u2019s reports to be \u201cuseful\u201d and asked Winer to \u201ccontinue to send them.\u201d He wrote: In 2013, I returned to the State Department at the request of Secretary of State John F. Kerry, whom I had previously served as Senate counsel. Over the years, Steele and I had discussed many matters relating to Russia. He asked me whether the State Department would like copies of new information as he developed it. I contacted Victoria Nuland, a career diplomat who was then assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, and shared with her several of Steele\u2019s reports. She told me they were useful and asked me to continue to send them. Over the next two years, I shared more than 100 of Steele\u2019s reports with the Russia experts at the State Department, who continued to find them useful. None of the reports related to U.S. politics or domestic U.S. matters, and the reports constituted a very small portion of the data set reviewed by State Department experts trying to make sense of events in Russia. Kramer and the dossier In his book, \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d McCain provided an inside account of how he says he came across the dossier. He wrote that he was told about the claims in the document at a security conference in Canada in November 2016, where he was approached by Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow and friend of ex-British spy Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier. McCain wrote that Wood told him Steele \u201chad been commissioned to investigate connections between the Trump campaign and Russian agents as well as potentially compromising information about the President-elect that Putin allegedly possessed.\u201d McCain, however, did not address the obvious question of whether he was told exactly who \u201ccommissioned\u201d Steele to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the alleged Russian ties.\u00a0 The dossier was paid for by Clinton\u2019s campaign and the DNC. McCain goes on to describe Wood as telling him Steele\u2019s work \u201cwas mostly raw, unverified intelligence, but that the author strongly believed merited a thorough examination by counterintelligence experts.\u201d The politician says the dossier claims described to him were \u201ctoo strange a scenario to believe, something out of a le Carr\u00e9 novel, not the kind of thing anyone has ever actually had to worry about with a new President, no matter what other concerns.\u201d Still, McCain says he reasoned that \u201ceven a remote risk that the President of the United States might be vulnerable to Russian extortion had to be investigated.\u201d McCain concedes Wood told him he had not actually read the dossier himself, and writes that he wasn\u2019t sure if he ever met Wood before and couldn\u2019t recall previously having a conversation with Wood. Still, McCain took Wood\u2019s word for it when Wood vouched for Steele\u2019s credibility. \u201cSteele was a respected professional, Wood assured us, who had good Russian contacts and long experience collecting and analyzing intelligence on the Kremlin,\u201d McCain wrote. Present at the meeting with Wood and McCain was Kramer, who McCain writes agreed to \u201cgo to London to meet Steele, confirm his credibility and report back to me.\u201d McCain doesn\u2019t detail Kramer\u2019s visit to London beyond simply writing, \u201cWhen David returned, and shared his impression that the former spy was, as Sir Andrew had vouched, a respected professional, and not to outward appearances given to hyperbole or hysteria, I agreed to receive a copy of what is now referred to as \u2018the dossier.\u2019\u2019\u2019 McCain leaves out exactly where Kramer obtained his dossier copy. The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported last February that Kramer received the dossier directly from Fusion GPS after McCain expressed interest in it. Those details marked the clearest indication that McCain may have known that the dossier originated with Fusion GPS, meaning that he may have knowingly passed on political material to the FBI. Also, in a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0oped\u00a0in January, GPS co-founders Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritch wrote that they helped McCain share their anti-Trump dossier with the Obama-era intelligence community via an unnamed \u201cemissary.\u201d In his own testimony, Kramer relates conversations with Simpson about the dossier.

Then he went thumbs down, badly hurting the Republican party badly hurting our nation and hurting many sick people who desperately wanted good, affordable health care. 3) McCain failed to help veterans Trump said: McCain didn\u2019t get the job done for our great vets in the VA. And they knew it, that\u2019s why when I had my dispute with him, I had such incredible support from the vets and from the military. The vets were on my side because I got the job done. I got choice and I got accountability. 4) McCain pushed for America to get into the Iraq War and the Middle East Trump said: The other thing is we\u2019re in a war in the middle east that McCain pushed so hard. He was calling Bush, President Bush all the time. \u2018Get into the Middle East. Get into the Middle East,\u2019 So now we\u2019re into that war for $7 trillion, thousands and thousands of our people have been killed, millions of people overall. And frankly, we\u2019re straightening it out now, but it has been a disaster for our country. We\u2019ve have spent tremendous wealth, and tremendous lives in that war. And what do we have? It is worse than 19 years ago. I called them \u2018The Endless Wars\u2019 \u2026 John McCain loved it. 5) McCain Betrayed Him Even Though Donald Trump Endorsed Him \u201cI endorsed him at his request,\u201d Trump recalled. 6) Trump Never got thanked by the McCain family for giving them the \u201cfuneral that he wanted.\u201d Trump said: I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve. I don\u2019t care about this. I didn\u2019t get thank you. That\u2019s okay. We sent him on the way, but I wasn\u2019t a fan of John McCain. Trump tried to put the issue to rest, telling the group of workers that he was \u201csaving time with the press\u201d later as the issue continued to fascinate reporters in the establishment media. \u201cSo now what we can say, now we\u2019re all set I don\u2019t think I have to answer that question but the press keeps [asking], \u2018What do you think of McCain, what do you think?'\u201d Trump concluded. \u201cNot my kind of guy, but some people like him and I think that\u2019s great.\u201d",

Trump has criticized McCain over the past several days, after reports surfaced that McCain had asked one of his aides to distribute the Democrat-funded and Fusion GPS-produced dossier that claimed collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the days after the 2016 election. Trump critics have been calling on Republicans to speak out against Trump\u2019s criticism of McCain, and particularly on Graham, a close friend of McCain. Graham said during the interview that he did not like Trump\u2019s comments on McCain, but that it would not stop him from working with the president. Graham said: I love John McCain. I traveled the world with him. I learned a lot from him. He\u2019s an American hero and nothing will diminish that. I think the president\u2019s comments about Senator McCain hurt him more than they hurt the legacy of Senator McCain. I\u2019m going to try to continue to help the president.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " The context was President Trump\u2019s renewed criticism of McCain after a newly-released deposition showed how deeply McCain was involved in the fraudulent \u201cRussia dossier\u201d that has been used to attack the administration and divide the nation. Brazile, who Fox News recently hired as a contributor, began by criticizing the president for speaking ill of the dead. She then continued: \u201cJohn McCain leaves a legacy. He leaves a legacy of sacrifice. \u2026 John McCain should be honored for his service.\u201d It is heart-warming to read tributes to McCain from people who ignored his heroism and sacrifice and smeared his character when he ran against Barack Obama and, later, criticized him as president. In 2014, for example, Brazile tweeted a hit piece on McCain, \u201cThe Vacant Soul of Senator John McCain.\u201d She added: \u201cInteresting article.\u201d   The article was a response to McCain\u2019s criticism of Obama for the Bowe Berghdal prisoner swap, in which the U.S. freed five major Taliban terrorists from Guantanamo Bay. McCain, a prisoner-of-war himself in Vietnam for five-and-a-half years, nevertheless criticized the deal. (Berghdal was later convicted of desertion.) What Brazile called an \u201cinteresting article\u201d was a mean-spirited personal attack, with lines such as: \u201cMcCain had so much sunshine blown up his ass that his colon must have looked like Cabo San Lucas.\u201d It referred to the war hero as a \u201csmall boy,\u201d and accused him of handing U.S. foreign policy to corrupt \u201cspooks and crooks.\u201d When McCain was alive, and \u2014 as it happens \u2014 in the right, Brazile said he had a \u201cvacant soul.\u201d Now she is his number-one fan. The media do not love McCain for his service, which many did their best to ignore. No \u2014 the media love him as a foil to other Republicans \u2014 a role he has relished playing from the time he was the maverick alternative to George W. Bush during the 2000 Republican primary. They hated him when he was an effective critic of Obama\u2019s foreign policy. They loved him again when he feuded with Trump in the 2015-6 election. McCain made sure the feud would continue beyond his death. The media loved it, too: \u201cMr. McCain had carefully stage-managed a four-day celebration of his life \u2014 but what was also an unmistakable rebuke to President Trump and his agenda,\u201d the New York Times wrote. At the time, Trump swallowed his pride. Now that he is talking about McCain again, the last people to criticize the president should be those, like Donna Brazile, who trashed him while he was living, and when it mattered. Joel B.

      "subtitle": "TEL AVIV \u2014 David Kramer, a long-time advisor to late Senator John McCain, revealed that he spent \u201ca good hour or two\u201d talking to two Wall Street Journal editors in a failed attempt to convince them not to publish the name of Christopher Steele, the former British spy who authored the infamous, largely-discredited anti-Trump dossier.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " In a deposition on Dec. 13, 2017 that was recently posted online, Kramer recounted briefing numerous reporters in private about the dossier. He admitted that, at the request of Steele, he held a meeting about the dossier with a reporter from BuzzFeed News who he says snapped photos of the controversial document without Kramer\u2019s permission when he left the room to go to the bathroom. That meeting was held at the McCain Institute office in Washington, Kramer stated. BuzzFeed infamously published Steele\u2019s full dossier on January 10, 2017, setting off a firestorm of news media coverage about the document. BuzzFeed posted the full dossier hours after CNN\u00a0first reported the same day the leaked information that the controversial contents of the dossier were presented during classified briefings inside classified documents presented one week earlier to then-president Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump. In the deposition, Kramer disclosed that, at the request of Steele, the McCain deputy also met with CNN\u2019s Carl Bernstein to brief him in the dossier. Bernstein\u2019s byline appeared on the January 10 CNN article first reporting on the dossier contents. Neither CNN nor BuzzFeed named Steele as the author of the dossier in their respective reports. Steele\u2019s name was first disclosed one day later in a Wall Street Journal article titled, \u201cChristopher Steele, Ex-British Intelligence Officer, Said to Have Prepared Dossier on Trump.\u201d In his deposition, Kramer says that he tried to convince the Wall Street Journal not to reveal Steele\u2019s name. He says that Steele called him \u201cwithin an hour\u201d after the memo was initially published, ostensibly referring to BuzzFeed\u2019s January 10 publication. The next day, after he learned about the pending Wall Street Journal story, Kramer says that he called the newspaper about withholding Steele\u2019s identity: He [Steele] called me. And then after that the next day I learned the\u00a0Wall Street Journal was going to publish his name. Mr. Steele\u2019s name. I contacted two editors there to ask them not to do so. They had already made up their mind, it was clear to me, although I spent a good hour or two talking to them, explaining to them why this was a terrible decision on their part. They went ahead and did so, and then Mr. Steele went into hiding. Kramer did not say during that part of the testimony why he thought it was a \u201cterrible\u201d decision to publish Steele\u2019s name. He also did not say how he learned that the Wall Street Journal was planning to reveal Steele was the dossier\u2019s author. Kramer did say that after Steele\u2019s name surfaced, the ex-British spy told him that the publicity \u201cwas causing considerable problems for him.\u201d Kramer also recalled Steele telling him, \u201cYeah, he said this wasn\u2019t supposed to happen this way.\u201d \u201cI said the same thing to Mr. Simpson,\u201d Kramer added, \u201cthat this was only supposed to have been released or posted and published if it had been verified.\u201d Kramer was referring to Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which hired Steele to do the anti-Trump work that resulted in the compilation of the dossier. Fusion GPS was paid for its anti-Trump work by Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee via the Perkins Coie law firm. The Wall Street Journal article in question named Steele as the dossier author, but did not report on the role of Fusion GPS in producing the anti-Trump document. Prior to his death, McCain admitted to personally handing the dossier to then-FBI Director James Comey, but he refused repeated requests for comment about whether he had a role in providing the dossier to BuzzFeed, including numerous inquiries sent to his office by this reporter. In his book published last year, McCain maintained he had an \u201cobligation\u201d to pass the dossier charges against Trump to Comey and he would even do it again. \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t like it can go to hell,\u201d McCain exclaimed. Kramer\u2019s testimony sheds a new light on the role of McCain\u2019s office in disseminating the dossier that was reportedly involved in the FBI\u2019s initial investigation into the Trump campaign and unsubstantiated claims of Russian collusion. In addition, Comey cited the dossier as evidence in a successful FISA application to obtain a warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, a former adviser to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. Kramer said that he believed McCain was sought out in order to provide credibility to the dossier claims. \u201cI think they felt a senior Republican was better to be the recipient of this rather than a Democrat because if it were a Democrat, I think that the view was that it would have been dismissed as a political attack,\u201d Kramer stated.

If social media bans me in five years, why would an old guy counting the seconds to retirement, to the moment he can drive a \u00a0pickup truck over his iPhone, give even half a damn? So it is with more amusement than concern that I watch as fascist social media corporations, the Democrat Party, and most especially the corporate media go the full-Orwell when it comes to throughtcrimes. My use of Orwell\u2019s \u201cthoughtcrime\u201d is not for affect or hyperbole. Without question, there is a serious, organized, and intense campaign at work here, a campaign backed by billions of corporate dollars, to abuse the public into believing things that are simply not true. And the punishment for committing the crime of holding \u201cunacceptable\u201d thoughts and/or ideas is real: public shaming, bullying, banishment from the public square (social media), and economic sanctions \u2014 job losses, advertising boycotts, etc. Here are three of the most absurd thoughtcrimes: Gender is Fluid No, not it\u2019s not. Biologically, gender is imprinted on every strand of your DNA and is more pronounced than skin color. That is scientific fact. But this is how absurd things have become: if I ran around pretending to be a black woman, even though I have more science on my side to back up my claim of being black, the anti-science fascists would condemn my cultural appropriation while celebrating my gender dysphoria. It\u2019s pure madness, and it goes like this\u2026 Caitlyn Jenner is a woman. No, he\u2019s not. She is because she says she is. Science, biology, and his schlong says he\u2019s not. You\u2019re a bigot. Because I don\u2019t want mentally ill men allowed in public restrooms with young girls? How dare you call her mentally ill. It is what it is. So androgynous rock stars are mentally ill \u2014 David Bowie and Annie Lennox? Gender non-conformity is not the same as gender dysphoria. One is rebellion, self expression. The other is something tragic. People should be allowed to live their lives in whatever way they choose. That\u2019s rich coming from a pronoun Nazi. You\u2019re a monster. Trans people deserve our compassion and support. Agreed. My uncle identified as a TV antennae. We didn\u2019t patronize him. We got him help. We could have exploited him. Put him in the circus or on the roof. But because we care about him, he got treatment. You\u2019re exploiting people in desperate need of psychological help for political reasons. That makes you the monster. Call Caitlyn a \u201cshe\u201d and believe it or you\u2019re blacklisted. Oh, and these trans folks are going to destroy women\u2019s sports. They\u2019re women because they say they\u2019re women. Call me Napoleon. Obese Swimsuit Models are Beautiful No, no they\u2019re not. They\u2019re the opposite of attractive. Sure, some people find naked obese women (and men) attractive, but that\u2019s what we call a fetish. Today, however, we are being ordered to find a 300 pound woman in a string bikini sexy \u2014 or at least to pretend we do convincingly enough to avoid punishment. Hey, I\u2019m not trying to be an asshole about this; no one wants to see me in a speedo, but I\u2019m not the fascist who\u2019s bullying everyone into pretending otherwise. And it goes like this\u2026 Naked, fat women are beautiful. Do you believe in evolution? Of course I do. Scientifically it makes no sense for our species to find obese women attractive, which is why we don\u2019t. It is a biological fact that men are hard-wired to look for healthy mates as a means to propagate the species, which is why \u2014 \u00a0whether it is someone who\u2019s ill, someone very old, or an obese someone \u2014 unhealthy people are unattractive to us. Nature has programmed us to not be sexually turned on by the unhealthy, and that includes fat people. You\u2019re a bigot. How can my personal tastes and preferences make me a bigot? Am I a bigot because I don\u2019t like Lord of the Rings or Jerry Lewis movies or watching two guys kiss? So you\u2019re a homophobe! My stash of lesbian porn says different, and I\u2019m not discriminating against fat people, saying we should not hire them or give them housing. I just don\u2019t want to see them in underwear catalogs. People should be allowed to live their lives however they wish. You keep saying that even as you bully me over my personal beliefs. You\u2019re a monster for not lying about this. Fat women need your support. What they need is a treadmill. John McCain Was an Honorable, Patriotic, Super-Duper American This is my favorite thoughtcrime. Maybe my all-time favorite. Why? Because I\u2019m old enough to remember when the media told me McCain was an old, white, racist, womanizing, corrupt war criminal. But that was back in \u201908 when he was the only thing between a Democrat and the White House. Today, however, he is St. John McCain. Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy can trash the late Ronald Reagan all she wants with no repercussions, but President Trump criticizing McCain\u2019s dishonorable role in a number of dishonorable acts \u2014 why you\u2019d think Trump was hiring Russian hookers to pee on a bed Obama slept in, or something. And it goes like this\u2026 John McCain was one of the greatest and most honorable Americans who ever lived. Ten years ago you told me he was a racist war criminal. Ten years ago you voted for him. Because my only other choice was socialist who hung out with domestic terrorists. Shame on you. John McCain was a war hero. Yes, he was a war hero, but even war heroes can grow into bitter, dishonest, and petty old men \u2014 and that is what happened to John McCain. You\u2019re only saying that to side with Trump. I\u2019ve despised John McCain since the aughts, since he constantly undermined President George W. Bush as payback for losing the 2000 primary and as a means to seek favor with the establishment media because he knew he would run for president again in 2008. John McCain was a preening, narcissistic peacock 15 years before he launched this feud with Trump. And yes, he did launch this feud with Trump. McCain started it. John McCain was honorable to the end. He wasn\u2019t all bad, but he was one of the Keating Five and his fascist attempt to protect incumbency by criminalizing political speech through the McCain-Feingold Act is the most un-American pieces of legislation passed in the last 50 years. What\u2019s more, his neurotic and narcissistic need to be seen as \u201chonorable\u201d resulted in him suspending his presidential campaign \u2014 the single most dumbest thing I have ever witnessed. How dare you speak the truth about an honorable man! Tell me what\u2019s honorable about giving your word to voters over the course of a decade about repealing Obamacare and then breaking your word so you can bathe in a news-cycle? What\u2019s honorable about attacking the powerless or planning your own never-ending funeral, a funeral longer than a presidential funeral, and premising it on your own spite? What\u2019s honorable about never letting go of grudges? What\u2019s honorable about trying to make Hillary Clinton president by spreading a dossier filled with lies to your pals in the media? McCain is dead, yes, but he died a petty, grasping, dishonest, backstabbing old man. As if Trump is perfect. As if you freaks demand I say he is. You shouldn\u2019t speak ill of the dead. Don\u2019t force me to by demanding I swallow your lies. We should end this debate on common ground. Meghan McCain is a horrible person. I\u2019ll drink to that. \u2014 You see what\u2019s happening? Corporate power is not arguing with us, is not debating us\u2026 which would be fine. Rather, these fascist corporations are creating actual \u201cthoughtcrimes,\u201d not only by criminalizing certain beliefs and opinions, but the belief in something scientifically true. Men cannot become women. Lena Dunham\u2019s naked body is disgusting. John McCain was not a good man. Sorry, he just wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t like saying that about a dead man, but I won\u2019t be bullied into silence in the face of all these revisionist lies. Trump has every right to be furious with McCain. Yes, he may be dead, but as Michelle Malkin put it so well, his dishonorable legacy lives through the victims of Obamacare and the phony Russia dossier. And if the media don\u2019t want to see McCain criticized, they should stop asking Trump about McCain. But the media do keep asking because they know Trump is guilty of thoughtcrime, of not holding the \u201capproved\u201d opinion of McCain, and asking about McCain allows the media to keep punishing that particular thoughtcrime. It is sick and un-American, to say the least. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.",

Mueller\u2019s final report predictably found no collusion between Donald Trump or his 2016 campaign and Russia, it is time for the appropriate investigative authorities to probe the possibility of crimes committed in the perpetuation of the Russia collusion hoax.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " Below, in no particular order, are eight key questions related to possible wrongdoing in the sordid Russia collusion affair. 1 \u2013 Was a false crime deliberately reported to the FBI? Former British spy Christopher Steele reportedly met on July 5, 2016 with a Rome-based special agent, where he turned over the unsubstantiated, largely-discredited anti-Trump charges listed in his infamous dossier alleging collusion between Russia and Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. The controversial Fusion GPS firm hired Steele to do the anti-Trump work that resulted in the compilation of the dossier. Fusion GPS was paid for its anti-Trump work by Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee via the Perkins Coie law firm. The dossier contents were so unverified that numerous major media outlets briefed on the document refused to publish stories on the salacious material. The BBC\u00a0reported\u00a0that Steele\u2019s information served as a \u201croad map\u201d for the FBI\u2019s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. 2 \u2013 Were Obama administration officials involved in passing dossier charges of questionable political origin to the FBI or bolstering Steele\u2019s credibility to the bureau? David Kramer, a long-time adviser to late Senator John McCain, revealed in testimony that he met with two Obama administration officials to inquire about whether the anti-Trump dossier authored by former British spy Christopher Steele was being taken seriously. In a deposition on Dec. 13, 2017 that was recently posted online, Kramer said that McCain specifically asked him in early December 2016 to meet about the dossier with Victoria Nuland, a senior official in John Kerry\u2019s State Department, as well as an official from the National Security Council. Nuland\u2019s specific role in the dossier episode has been the subject of some controversy for her. In their book, Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin\u2019s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, authors and reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn write that Nuland gave the green light for the FBI to first meet with Steele regarding his dossier\u2019s claims. It was at that meeting that Steele initially reported his dossier charges to the FBI, the book relates. Steele sought out Rome-based FBI Special Agent Michael Gaeta, with whom he had worked on a previous case. Before Gaeta met with Steele on July 5, 2016, the book relates that the FBI first secured the support of Nuland, who at the time was assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs specializing in Russia. Regarding the arrangements for Steele\u2019s initial meeting with the FBI about the dossier claims, Isikoff and Corn report: There were a few hoops Gaeta had to jump through. He was assigned to the U.S. embassy in Rome. The FBI checked with Victoria Nuland\u2019s office at the State Department: Do you support this meeting? Nuland, having found Steele\u2019s reports on Ukraine to have been generally credible, gave the green light. Within a few days, on July 5, Gaeta arrived and headed to Steele\u2019s office near Victoria station. Steele handed him a copy of the report. Gaeta, a seasoned FBI agent, started to read. He turned white. For a while, Gaeta said nothing. Then he remarked, \u201cI have to report this to headquarters.\u201d The book documents that Nuland previously received Steele\u2019s reports on the Ukrainian crisis and had been familiar with Steele\u2019s general work. An extensive New Yorker profile of Steele named another former official from Kerry\u2019s State Department for alleged involvement in circulating the dossier. The magazine reported that Kerry\u2019s chief of staff at the State Department, John Finer, obtained the contents of a two-page summary of the dossier and eventually decided to share the questionable document with Kerry. Finer received the dossier summary from Jonathan M. Winer, the Obama State Department official who acknowledged regularly interfacing and exchanging information with Steele, according to the report. Winer previously conceded that he shared the dossier summary with Nuland. After his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with Steele. Winer further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an \u201cold friend.\u201d Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal \u2013 which Winer in turn gave to Steele \u2013 originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals. 3 \u2013 Did James Comey withhold from the FISA court key information raising questions about the dossier, which was utilized as evidence in successful FISA applications to obtain successive warrants to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, a former adviser to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign? Comey signed the first of three FISA applications in late October 2016. The second and third were renewal applications since a FISA warrant must be renewed every 90 days. All three applications reportedly cited the dossier. Comey cited the Steele dossier in the applications to monitor Page even though his own FBI determined the document was \u201conly minimally corroborated.\u201d A House GOP memo on the matter relates that after dossier author Steele was terminated months earlier as an FBI source a \u201csource validation report conducted by an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele\u2019s reporting as only minimally corroborated.\u201d Still, Comey saw fit, according to the Republican and Democrat memos, to utilize the dossier in the FISA documents. In recently released testimony, Bruce Ohr, a career Justice Department official, stated he informed the FBI that the infamous, largely discredited Steele dossier was based on \u201chearsay\u201d and not tangible evidence. Ohr said that he transmitted that information in the time period before the FBI under Comey used the controversial dossier as central evidence in the FISA application. As Breitbart News reported, Ohr also testified that he informed the FBI at the same time that Steele\u2019s dossier was tied to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Ohr testified that he further warned his FBI superiors that the dossier information was likely \u201cbiased\u201d against Trump and that he thought Steele was \u201cdesperate that Trump not be elected.\u201d Ohr revealed that he spoke to the FBI about the role of Fusion GPS in producing the dossier, and informed the agency that his wife, Nellie Ohr, worked at the time for Fusion GPS. Comey\u2019s FISA application to conduct surveillance did not specifically state that the FBI had information that Steele was being paid in connection with any U.S. political party, according to House documents and the redacted FISA application itself. The application also did not say that the FBI was provided with any information that would raise issues of bias concerning Steele. Instead, Comey\u2019s FISA application stated generally that \u201cthe FBI speculates\u201d that Steele \u201cwas likely looking for information that could be used to discredit\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 a far cry from informing the court that the dossier utilized as central evidence against Page in the FISA warrant was paid for by Trump\u2019s primary political opponents. The phraseology that the FBI \u201cspeculates\u201d on possible bias is at odds with Ohr\u2019s testimony that he directly told the FBI about several possible avenues of bias and that he had reason to believe Steele himself was biased. In other words, Comey may have kept from the FISA court information that would at a minimum raise major questions about the dossier charges that were cited as key evidence against Page in the FISA applications. The House Intelligence Committee\u00a0memo documented that the dossier served as part of the basis for the warrant requests. \u201cNeither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele\u2019s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior and FBI officials,\u201d the memo states. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee\u00a0released a rebuttal of the House memo that confirms\u00a0the key contention that the FBI and DOJ both failed to inform the FISA court that Steele\u2019s dossier was funded by Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and the DNC via the Perkins Coie law firm. The Democratic memo quotes a footnote from the FISA application, which says that Steele: was approached by an identified U.S. person who indicated to Source #1 [Steele] that a U.S.-based law firm had hired the identified U.S. person to conduct research regarding Candidate #1\u2019s ties to Russia. (The identified U.S. person and Source #1 have a long-standing business relationship.) The identified U.S. person hired Source #1 to conduct this research. The identified U.S. person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into Candidate #1\u2019s ties to Russia.\u00a0The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign. That footnote, which does not inform the court of the dossier\u2019s ties to the DNC, Clinton campaign or Fusion GPS, was further confirmed when the Trump administration released a redacted version of the FISA applications last July. Meanwhile, in confirming that he told the FBI about his wife\u2019s relationship with Fusion GPS prior to the first FISA application, Ohr also spotlights the House GOP Intel memo\u2019s assertion that Nellie Ohr\u2019s connection to Fusion GPS, which produced a central piece of evidence in the FISA application, was \u201cinexplicably concealed\u201d from the FISA court. Comey\u2019s FISA application is also accused of incorrectly assessing that Steele did not provide information to Yahoo News. A Yahoo News article about an alleged trip by Page to Moscow was cited as purported evidence against Page in the FISA warrant, according to the House GOP memo. However, the memo relates that the Page FISA application \u201cincorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide information to Yahoo News.\u201d The GOP memo continued: Steele has admitted in British court filings that he met with Yahoo News and several other outlets in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie was aware of Steele\u2019s initial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington DC in 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed. 4 \u2013 Who leaked a classified briefing about the dossier contents to CNN? On January 10, CNN was first to\u00a0report\u00a0the leaked information that the controversial contents of the dossier were presented during classified briefings inside classified documents presented one week earlier to then President Obama and President-elect Trump. The classified briefings were presented by Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers. Comey reportedly briefed Trump alone on the most salacious charges in the dossier. CNN cited \u201cmultiple U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the briefings\u201d \u2013 in other words, officials leaking information about classified briefings \u2013 revealing the dossier contents were included in a two-page synopsis that served as an addendum to a larger report on Russia\u2019s alleged attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Prior to CNN\u2019s report leaking the Comey briefing to Trump, which was picked up by news agencies worldwide, the contents of the dossier had been circulating among news media outlets, but the sensational claims were largely considered too risky to publish. All that changed when the dossier contents were presented to Obama and Trump during the classified briefings. In other words, Comey\u2019s briefings themselves and the subsequent leak to CNN about those briefings by \u201cmultiple US officials with direct knowledge,\u201d seem to have given the news media the opening to report on the dossier\u2019s existence as well as allude to the document\u2019s unproven claims. Following the CNN report, the full dossier document was\u00a0published\u00a0hours later by BuzzFeed. 5 \u2013 Why were Obama and Trump briefed on the dossier in the first place given that the questionable document was funded by Trump\u2019s primary political opponents and the FBI itself could not corroborate the wild material? As per above, those two classified briefings were subsequently leaked to the news media and set in motion an avalanche of anti-Trump news media coverage on the dossier\u2019s wild allegations. The briefings also may have provided the veneer of respectability to a document circulated within the news media but widely considered too unverified to publicize. 6 \u2013 What role, if any, did the Obama-era Justice Department play in perpetuating the politically tinged Russia collusion narrative? Last year, the Justice Department inspector general (IG) referred former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe to Washington\u2019s top federal prosecutor after an IG\u2019s report found that McCabe had lied to investigators or Comey four times, including on three occasions where McCabe was under oath. McCabe also faced controversy over a much-debated text message from FBI Agent Peter Strzok, who helped lead the bureau\u2019s probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server. According to the four-page Republican House Intelligence Committee memo authored by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the Strzok message reportedly referred to \u201ca meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an \u2018insurance\u2019 policy against President Trump\u2019s election.\u201d There is also the case (cited above) of Bruce Ohr, a career Justice Department official, who admitted to interfacing repeatedly with dossier author Steele while Ohr\u2019s wife, Nellie, worked for Fusion GPS. Fusion, again, was paid by Clinton and the DNC to compile the Steele dossier. Possible Justice Department bias was spotlighted by the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General report on the Clinton email probe which described an extraordinary system of communication set up between former FBI official Lisa Page and former deputy director Andrew McCabe that bypassed the ordinary chain of command to communicate important information about the agency\u2019s probe of Clinton\u2019s email server. The method of communication involved ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was romantically involved with Page, sending information on the Clinton probe to McCabe through Page, the report found. Page and Strzok have been the subject of public controversy following revelations that they exchanged a series of anti-Trump text messages. Still more messages were revealed in the 500-plus page report Inspector General report, including messages in which the pair discussed stopping Trump from becoming president. 7 \u2013 Was the Clinton-funded dossier utilized in the Obama-era Intelligence Community\u2019s assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election? Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan gave contradictory testimony on the matter. The January 6, 2017 U.S. Intelligence Community (IC)\u00a0report\u00a0released by Comey\u2019s FBI, Brennan\u2019s CIA and the NSA under Mike Rogers assessed that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. It also claimed that Russia worked to aid Trump\u2019s electoral victory. In testimony before the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees, Comey stated that material from the Steele dossier was indeed utilized in the IC report. Internally, the FBI referred to the dossier as \u201ccrown material.\u201d \u201cSo do you recall whether any quote, crown material or dossier material was included in the IC assessment?\u201d Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) asked Comey. \u201cYes,\u201d Comey replied. \u201cI\u2019m going to be careful here because I\u2019m talking about a document that\u2019s still classified. The unclassified thing we talked about earlier today, the first paragraph you can see of exhibit A, is reflective of the fact that at least some of the material that Steele had collected was in the big thing called the intelligence community assessment in an annex called annex A.\u201d Annex A in the report was titled, \u201cRussia\u2014Kremlin\u2019s TV Seeks To Influence Politics, Fuel Discontent in US.\u201d The annex, like the rest of the report, contains the following disclaimer: This report is a declassified version of a highly classified assessment; its conclusions are identical to those in the highly classified assessment but this version does not include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign. Comey went on to describe a conversation that he said he had with Brennan about how to include the dossier material in the IC assessment: Gowdy: Do you recall the specific conversation or back and forth with then-Director Brennan on whether or not the material should be included in the IC assessment? Comey: Yes. I remember conversation \u2014 let me think about it for a second. I remember there was conversation about what form its presentation should take in the overarching document; that is, should it be in an annex; should it be in the body; that the intelligence community broadly found its source credible and that it was corroborative of the central thesis of the intelligence community assessment, and the discussion was should we put it in the body or put it in an attachment. I\u2019m hesitating because I don\u2019t remember whether I had that conversation \u2014 I had that conversation with John Brennan, but I remember that there was conversation about how it should be treated. Comey\u2019s descriptions are at direct odds with a statement Brennan made during May 2017 testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in which Brennan claimed the dossier was \u201cnot in any way used as the basis for the intelligence community\u2019s assessment\u201d on alleged Russian interference. Brennan repeated that claim during numerous news media interviews. Comey is not the only former top official involved in the IC report to say that the dossier played a role in the report\u2019s conclusions. As RealClearPolitics.com\u00a0documents, former NSA Director Rogers wrote in a classified letter that the dossier played a role in the IC\u2019s assessment and a dossier summary was included in an initial draft appendix: In a March 5, 2018 letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, Adm. Rogers informed the committee that a two-page summary of the dossier \u2014 described as \u201cthe Christopher Steele information\u201d \u2014 was \u201cadded\u201d as an \u201cappendix to the ICA draft,\u201d and that consideration of that appendix was \u201cpart of the overall ICA review/approval process.\u201d James Clapper, who served as director of National Intelligence under the Obama administration, conceded during a CNN\u00a0interview\u00a0that the IC assessment was able to corroborate \u201csome of the substantive content of the dossier,\u201d implying that the dossier itself was a factor. \u201cI think with respect to the dossier itself, the key thing is it doesn\u2019t matter who paid for it,\u201d Clapper said. \u201cIt\u2019s what the dossier said and the extent to which it was \u2014 it\u2019s corroborated or not. We had some concerns about it from the standpoint of its sourcing which we couldn\u2019t corroborate.\u201d \u201cBut at the same time, some of the substantive content, not all of it, but some of the substantive content of the dossier, we were able to corroborate in our Intelligence Community assessment which from other sources in which we had very high confidence to it,\u201d he added. It was Clapper\u2019s agency that released the Intelligence Community report. The purported inclusion of the dossier may help to explain why Rogers\u2019 NSA assessed the conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin favored Trump and worked to get him elected only with a classification of \u201cmoderate confidence,\u201d while the FBI and CIA gave it a \u201chigh confidence\u201d rating. 8 \u2013 Was the infamous Trump Tower meeting a political\u00a0dirty\u00a0trick against the Trump campaign? Multiple Breitbart News investigations into the infamous brief meeting at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016 between individuals tied to Russia, Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials point to the increasing likelihood of the confab being set up as a dirty trick against Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Three Russian participants at the meeting have ties to the controversial Fusion GPS outfit, and two have confirmed ties to Clinton. Also, email logs brought to light show numerous emails were exchanged between a Clinton associate, Fusion GPS and Trump Tower participants, with the subjects of some of those emails listing the Magnitsky Act, which sanctions Russian officials and was by all accounts the very topic of the Trump Tower meeting. One Russian participant in the Trump Tower presentation admits to personally knowing Hillary Clinton since the late 1990s and says he \u201cknew\u201d some of the people who worked on Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. Another Russian attendee, a translator, testified that he was previously an interpreter for Hillary herself as well as for John Kerry and Barack Obama. Questions are also raised by a timeline showing numerous personal meetings between Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson and Trump Tower participants. A Clinton associate, Ed Lieberman, was listed as being present at one and possibly two of those meetings. Separately, Lieberman met with one Russian participant the same day of the Trump Tower meeting, according to separate testimony. There are also questions about the initial setup of the Trump Tower meeting, with the publicist who sent the infamous email to Donald Trump Jr. promising \u201cinformation that would incriminate\u201d Clinton later admitting that he used deliberately hyperbolic language to ensure that the meeting took place. No such incriminating information on Hillary was provided, according to all meeting participants. In testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Robert Goldstone, the publicist, further said that he believes the meeting was a \u201cbait and switch\u201d by a Russian lobbyist seeking a meeting on another matter by misleadingly claiming to be bringing the Trump campaign dirt on Clinton.

      "content": " \u201cEurope\u2019s future\u201d rests on this May\u2019s EU Parliament elections, and the choice voters will be given of either between \u201cdestroying\u201d the bloc or \u201creforming\u201d it, according to a new Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) campaign video. Declaring the elections a battle between\u201cdestroying\u201d the bloc or \u201creforming\u201d it, ALDE says \u201cthe choice is clear\u201d, before graphics depicting the group\u2019s leader, Guy Verhofstadt, breaking through a barbed wire-topped border wall with an enormous representation of his head, bursting onto the screen accompanying a promise to \u2018tear walls down\u2019 rather than build them. \u201cEurope is NOT the problem. It is the solution,\u201d declares the video, which features cartoon hands grabbing at the EU flag. Verhofstadt\u2019s very public loathing of Hungary\u2019s patriotic government, which slashed illegal immigration by more than 99 per cent after building a series of powerful border fences, was also apparent elsewhere in the video. ALDE uses a photograph appearing to show\u00a0far left protesters, along with newspaper headlines lambasting Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n as an \u201cautocrat\u201d, to represent a choice between \u201cweakening freedom\u201d and \u201cstrengthening\u201d it at the elections.

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " Biden is facing intense blowback after two women came forward in recent days alleging\u00a0that the former\u00a0vice president made them feel uncomfortable at political events. Last week, Lucy Flores, a former Nevada\u00a0Democrat Assemblywoman, accused the 76-year-old of kissing the back of her head and smelling her hair at a campaign fundraiser in 2014. Flores called the interaction \u201cproblematic\u201d and disqualifying from running for president. On Monday, Amy Lappos, a former congressional aide to Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) alleged Biden rubbed his nose on hers during a 2009 event in Greenwich, Connecticut.\u00a0\u201cThis is the Al Franken thing all over again,\u201d Lappos said of Biden\u2019s behavior to the\u00a0Washington Examiner. In wake of the allegations, McCain took to social media to praise her late father Sen. John McCain\u2019s (R-AZ) former Senate colleague, tweeting: \u201cJoe Biden is one of the truly decent and compassionate men in all of American politics. He has helped me through my fathers diagnosis, treatment and ultimate passing more than anyone of my fathers friends combined. I wish there was more empathy from our politicians not less.\u201d  In a statement Sunday, an apologetic Biden contended that he \u201cnever\u201d touched anyone inappropriately, yet \u201cmay not recall these moments the same way.\u201d \u201d I will fight to build on the work I\u2019ve done in my career to end violence against women and ensure women are treated with the equality they deserve,\u201d the former vice president said in a statement. \u201cI will continue to surround myself with trusted women advisers who challenge me to see different perspectives than my own. And I will continue to speak out on these vitally-important issues where there is much more progress to be made and crucial fights that must be waged and won.\u201d On Monday, Biden spokesman Bill Russo issued another, more aggressive statement addressing the controversy surrounding photos of Biden interacting awkwardly with women and children, dismissing them as \u201csmears and forgeries\u201d that\u00a0have \u201cexisted in the dark recesses of the Internet for a while.\u201d \u201cThe Vice President has issued a statement affirming that in all the many years in public life that he has shaken a hand, given or received a hug, or laid his hand on a shoulder to express concern, support; or reassurance, he never intended to cause discomfort,\u201d said Russo. \u201cHe has said that he believes that women who have experienced any such discomfort, regardless of intention, should speak and be heard, and that he will be among those who listen. \u201cBut the important conversation about these issues are not advanced, nor are any criticisms of Vice President Biden validated, by the continued misrepresentation of the Carter and Coons moments, or a failure to be vigilant about a cottage industry of lies,\u201d he\u00a0added. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s potential 2020 rivals\u00a0have taken a different line than McCain, saying that the allegations should be taken seriously.\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said she believed Flores and that the former vice president \u201cneeds to give an answer\u201d in response to the allegations. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said \u201cLucy Flores felt demeaned, and that is never okay. If Vice President Biden becomes a candidate, this is a topic he\u2019ll have to engage on further.\u201d In a Sunday interview with ABC News\u00a0This Week, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) stated she has no reason to doubt\u00a0Flores\u2019 account. \u201cI have no reason not to believe her,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think we know from campaigns and from politics that people raise issues and they have to address them and that\u2019s what he will have to do with voters if he gets into the race.\u201d",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " A Hill-HarrisX poll released Thursday shows that practically zero Americans believe Obamacare\u2019s \u201ckey components\u201d improved their health care situation, while much larger numbers say Obamacare made things worse. Only 14 percent of registered voters said their monthly premiums have improved since Obama\u2019s boondoggle was passed into law in 2010. On the flip-side, 46 percent said their monthly premiums are now worse. On the issue of co-pays, only 13 percent say their co-pays are better while 35 percent say worse. On the issues of covered services, prescription drugs, and access to the same medical providers, respectively, only 17 percent, 17 percent, and 16 percent say things are better while 34 percent, 35 percent, and a plurality of 41 percent say worse. Other than the issue of provider access, on these same questions a plurality said nothing has changed. Current polling shows that when asked to simply choose between favoring or opposing Obamacare, a slim majority of 51 percent favor while 39 percent oppose, but that is still a terrible number for an entitlement program that\u2019s been around for nearly a decade. There is just no question that the country is still divided on the issue and probably tired of the bitter, decade-long argument over it, especially after the Republican Party failed to keep its repeal promise. The Hill-HarrisX poll, though, is a much better indicator of just how badly Obamacare is failing on the ground, in the practical world, on a personal level after every promise that was made to ensure the passage of the boondoggle turned out to be straight up lies and hoaxes. As it turns out, after dozens of promises from Obama himself, we were not allowed to keep the doctors and health insurance plans we liked. Millions and millions of Americans were screwed out of both. As it turns out, despite Obama\u2019s promise of an annual $2500 savings, Obamacare exploded the cost of monthly premiums by forcing millions and millions of American to enroll in government-mandated Cadillac plans most people do not need. The worst part of Obamacare, though, is the deductibles that can run into thousands of dollars. Heaven only knows how many millions of people are paying for an exorbitant monthly premium and for their own health care because of that obnoxiously high deductible. In other words, people are making payments on a Cadillac they never get to drive. The scourge of Obamacare would have been eliminated two years ago, but the late Sen. John McCain dishonored himself in a petty and vindictive vote against repeal, even though he was the deciding vote, even though on countless occasions over the years he promised he would vote for repeal. What one small and petty man did to kill an opportunity for real health care reform will haunt this country for generations.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.",

The Supreme Court in January voted 5-4 to grant President Trump\u2019s request to lift injunctions halting the policy as challenges continue in lower courts. In a 2017 tweet, the president declared his administration would no longer \u201caccept or allow\u201d transgender people to serve in the military due to \u201ctremendous medical costs and disruption\u201d. Then-Defence Secretary Jim Mattis modified the policy by narrowing the ban to individuals with a history of gender dysphoria. According to the\u00a0Palm Center, there are roughly\u00a08,980 active duty transgender troops presently serving. McCain, the daughter of the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), is one of President Trump\u2019s most vocal center-right critics.\u00a0 Appearing on\u00a0CNN with host Van Jones in late January, McCain said she hates the U.S. without her father\u2019s leadership. \u201cAs an American, I hate this country without him in it.

McCain recently\u00a0apologized\u00a0after law enforcement disputed her claim that she stopped a human-trafficking attempt at an airport in Glendale, Arizona. She made the false presumption because a\u00a0woman was accompanying a child of \u201ca different ethnicity.\u201d  In February, President Trump said human traffickers were \u201cgoing through a border where there\u2019s nobody for miles and miles, and there\u2019s no wall to protect,\u201d adding, \u201cthey come into our country and they sell people.\u201d  In her interview with NBC News, McCain also criticized the lack of civility in U.S.\u00a0politics and said that her late husband would have been saddened by the state of Democrat-Republican relations.\u00a0 \u201cI am quite certain he knows what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said. \u201cI know he\u2019d be so upset over this because of the tenor, the lack of inaction on many members\u2019 parts, specifically on members of Congress,\u201d McCain said. \u201cHe would\u2019ve been right in the mix saying we\u2019re going to work together, please let\u2019s not fight.

There are a lot of moving parts there and [Biden\u2019s campaign is] not necessarily organized. I wouldn\u2019t expect a formal family endorsement because some of McCain\u2019s family is still in the military, but I do expect Cindy to speak out at some point.\u201d The family source in the report also said they expect Meghan McCain to speak out in favor of Biden should he receive the nomination, but also anticipates an earlier endorsement from Cindy McCain. Sen. McCain, who served in Congress for 35 years and ran as the Republican nominee for president in 2008, did not always see eye to eye with President Trump. For years, the Trump and McCain families have feuded with one another. In 2015, Trump took a shot at McCain and claimed he was \u201cnot a war hero.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d Trump also said in 2015 he believed McCain had done \u201cvery little\u201d to assist with veterans. \u201cI think John McCain\u2019s done very little for the veterans. I\u2019m very disappointed in John McCain.\u201d During the 2016 election, Trump also claimed then Sen. McCain was\u00a0\u201cweak\u201d on immigration and insinuated that he was an \u201cincompetent\u201d senator. While his daughter Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner, attended McCain\u2019s funeral, President Trump was not invited by the McCain family to attend. While appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in February, Meghan McCain expressed her distaste for their attendance at the funeral. \u201cI thought that my family had made it clear, or at least I had, that the Trumps are unwelcome around me, and that my father had been sort of very clear about the line between the McCains and the Trumps.\u201d Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.",

John McCain (R-AZ) were longtime friends while serving together in the U.S. Senate. Meghan\u2019s remarks on Thursday weren\u2019t the first in which she praised the Democrat elder.

      "content": " During a Wednesday campaign rally in Iowa City, Iowa, Biden attempted to convince voters that China is no threat to American jobs and prosperity, a blatantly absurd and ignorant point of view. Talk about anti-science. But that is exactly what he said: China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man. They can\u2019t even figure out how to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the east, I mean in the west, They can\u2019t figure out how they are going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system. I mean, you know, they\u2019re not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they\u2019re not competition for us. \u201cI hear these stories about how China is going to eat our lunch. Give me a break!\u201d he added for good measure. This is exactly the kind of talk that handed the Rustbelt to President Trump in 2016, that got him over the finish line in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan; that crumbled the Democrat Party\u2019s Big Blue Wall. What\u2019s more, this is exactly the kind of talk that won Trump the Republican nomination against 16 seasoned, albeit hapless, Republican politicians. Trump earned the working class vote, took it away from the Democrats, by finally acknowledging what \u201cfree trade\u201d has done to gut America\u2019s working class, to annihilate the Rustbelt, to shatter our manufacturing base. Like a lot of Republicans, I bought into those \u201cfree trade\u201d arguments \u2026 until the utter devastation this way of thinking became too awful to ignore. China Joe can puff out his chest with empty rhetoric about how our guys are better than their guys, and while he\u2019s right about that, he is also deliberately ignoring how the deck has been stacked against our guys, how the game is rigged at the expense of the American worker. For decades we\u2019ve been the free trade suckers not charging tariffs while other countries, most especially China, a murdered us with theirs. How is that \u201cfree trade?\u201d It\u2019s not, but it does benefit the American establishment and the wealthy while the American men and women who make things lose everything. Sure, the stuff from China is coming in cheap, but when your jobs plan is to tell an unemployed factory worker to \u201clearn to code,\u201d it had better be cheap. How stupid is China Joe to dismiss, wrist-flick, and take us back to a time before we had learned our lesson? But that has always been the problem with China Joe: on top of being corrupt, he\u2019s a dimwit, a gaffe machine, a lounge singer without the self-awareness to see everyone\u2019s laughing at his swagger. And the corruption is real and might help to explain why Biden is dog-whistling to China that they have nothing to worry about from a Biden administration. Breitbart\u2019s own Peter Schweizer has already uncovered a number of legitimate questions about the Biden family\u2019s disturbing ties to China. On Sunday, the Fox News Channel\u2019s Steve Hilton laid it all out perfectly: In December 2013, then-Vice President Biden rode Air Force Two on an official trip to Asia, as tensions were high over disputed territories in the East China Sea. Biden was joined by his son, Hunter, who was building a private equity firm along with his business partner and friend, Chris Heinz \u2013 heir of the Heinz Ketchup family fortune and stepson of then-Secretary of State John Kerry. \u2026 Joe Biden struck a soft, friendly tone with the Chinese leadership, disappointing allies in the area, like Japan, who were alarmed by China\u2019s increasing aggression. But perhaps Joe had other issues besides the global balance of power on his mind, issues like his son\u2019s business deals. Hunter\u2019s presence on the trip was far from coincidence. Just 10 days later, his company, Rosemont Seneca, signed an exclusive $1 billion deal with the state-owned Bank of China, creating an investment fund called Bohai Harvest, with money backed by the Chinese government. In the words of Peter Schweizer, who first unveiled these conflicts of interest in his book \u201cSecret Empires,\u201d \u201cthe Chinese government was literally funding a business that it co-owned along with the sons of two of America\u2019s most powerful decision makers.\u201d That is what it looks like to be \u201ccompromised by a foreign power.\u201d But let\u2019s say there\u2019s no there there. As difficult as that might be to believe looking at the evidence, let\u2019s give Biden the benefit of the doubt. It doesn\u2019t matter. Biden\u2019s gaffe, his gobsmacking decision to dismiss China\u2019s ability to gut America\u2019s working class, is such a big deal it\u2019s almost as if Trump wrote it himself. Sorry Democrats, Donald Trump cannot be psyched out like the neurotic John McCain. Sorry corrupt media, Donald Trump will not turn into a pile of cowardly mush like Mitt Romney. Trump is Trump and what Biden did here was hand the president a Flintstone-sized club to beat him up all over the Midwest with. Biden basically directed, produced, wrote, and starred in Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania/Wisconsin/Michigan campaign ads. Above all that, it\u2019s just a fact that Joe Biden is a terrible presidential candidate, one of the worst ever, and now that he\u2019s nearing 80-years-old, age is catching up to him. If the economy holds, and it looks like it will, now that the media\u2019s Russia Collusion Hoax has been debunked, Trump, like any incumbent president who can legitimately run on peace and prosperity, is going to be tough to beat in 2020. But if the Democrats want a chance at taking back the White House, Joe Biden, a frail, corrupt, dunderhead who represents yesterday, is a terrible choice. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

McCain\u2019s purported remarks don\u2019t come as a complete surprise, as he and the president shared a rocky relationship for years. In 2015, President Trump said the Vietnam War veteran was \u201cnot a war hero,\u201d citing his capture. While campaigning for the presidency in 2016, President Trump\u00a0called\u00a0McCain \u201cweak\u201d on immigration and suggested that he was an \u201cincompetent\u201d senator. President Trump was not invited by the McCain family to attend the Arizona senator\u2019s funeral, though White House advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were in attendance. Appearing on\u00a0The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u00a0in February, Meghan expressed displeasure with President Trump\u2019s family members attending the funeral.\u00a0\u201cI thought that my family had made it clear, or at least I had, that the Trumps are unwelcome around me, and that my father had been sort of very clear about the line between the McCains and the Trumps,\u201d she\u00a0said. In March, President Trump\u00a0blasted McCain over his role in the dissemination of the anti-Trump Steele dossier, accusing the late lawmaker of doing so for\u00a0\u00a0\u201cvery evil purposes.\u201d \u201cIt was a fake. It was a fraud. It was paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats,\u201d the president said of the dossier in an interview with Fox Business Network\u2019s\u00a0Maria Bartiromo. \u201cThey gave it to John McCain who gave it to the FBI for very evil purposes. That\u2019s not good. And the other thing, he voted against repeal and replace. Now, he\u2019s been campaigning for years for repeal and replace. I\u2019m not a fan. After all of this time, he\u2019s \u2014 think of this \u2014repeal and replace. We would have had great health care.\u201d ",

      "subtitle": "Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews on\u00a0Hardball\u00a0on Monday that President Donald Trump \u201cfeels at home with\u201d recent acts of racist violence, citing Trump\u2019s comments on the Charlottesville riots in 2017 as proof.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Lewis said: I\u00a0don\u2019t think this president has been helpful. I think he feels at home with what is going on. When he reacted to what was happening in Charlottesville, you know, \u201cGood people on both sides,\u201d I cried. It\u2019s not the America that I dream for, the one I was trying to help set right. It\u2019s not the America we had during the days of President [John F.] Kennedy and Lyndon \u00a0Johnson. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s different. In fact, President Trump had been\u00a0referring to non-violent protesters on both sides of the issue of the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. He specifically excluded neo-Nazis and extremists, whom he said should be \u201ccondemned totally.\u201d Moreover, Trump had delivered a televised statement from the White House the day before. \u201cRacism is evil \u2014 and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,\u201d he said, as CNN noted. Lewis, prompted by Matthews \u2014 who likened him to \u201ca character out of the Bible\u201d \u2014 went on to claim that Trump\u2019s election \u201carrested that movement toward goodness and openness\u201d that had characterized race relations under his predecessors. In fact, a widely-cited Gallup poll shows race relations began to decline during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, in the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin controversy and through the Black Lives Matter movement that followed. In 2010, Lewis was at the center of another alleged racial hoax, when several Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus claimed that Tea Party protesters had shouted the \u201cn-word\u201d at him as he walked through their demonstration on the weekend that Congress was voting on Obamacare. The claim, widely repeated throughout the media and used to malign the Tea Party as racist, was never substantiated. Though Lewis and his colleagues were surrounded by hundreds of video cameras at the time, no video of the alleged incident has ever emerged, despite the late Andrew Breitbart offering to donate $100,000 to the United Negro College Fund in exchange for any video proof of the incident. Lewis, who was infamously beaten during a civil rights march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, has been known to put the heroism of his distinguished past to partisan use. In 2008, Lewis cast Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as racists, likening the Republican presidential ticket to segregationist (Democrat) George Wallace, noting that Wallace \u201ccreated the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans\u201d and warning the Republican candidates were doing the same, without explaining how. McCain had, in fact, just cited Lewis as one of three leaders whom he would consult for advice once elected. In 2018, after McCain\u2019s death, Lewis praised the late senator as a \u201cwarrior for peace.\u201d Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

But a spokesperson for the U.S. Pacific Fleet told NBC News\u00a0that the photo in the Wall Street Journal article was from Friday and the tarp was taken down on Saturday.\u00a0The President visited the troops on Monday. The ship is currently under repair after crashing into a merchant ship in 2017, killing 10 sailors. The Navy also clarified the report on Twitter.

Last December,\u00a0Senate Human Rights Caucus co-chairs Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and\u00a0Christopher Coons (D-DE) introduced a bill to name the body after the Arizona Republican. \u201cSenator McCain was a remarkable man who used his role in the Senate to advocate for human rights and to stand up for people around the world who were denied basic freedoms. He embodied our country\u2019s values and understood the critical role of the United States in promoting human rights across the globe,\u201d Coons said in a statement at the time. In February, a measure to create the commission was reintroduced and attracted the support of Cindy McCain, the former lawmaker\u2019s widow, who wrote in a tweet that she was \u201cgrateful\u201d for lawmakers supporting the initiative: \u201cGrateful to @ChrisCoons & @SenThomTillis, along w/ @SenJeffMerkley, @SenMarkey, @marcorubio & @SenatorSinema, for re-introducing leg. to establish the John McCain Human Rights Commission. The U.S. must lead on human rights. What a wonderful way to honor my husband\u2019s legacy.\u201d  Later this week, lawmakers aim to include an amendment that would create the commission when debate begins on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been studying other ways to honor McCain\u2019s legacy. In March,\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced he would revive a plan to rename the Russell Senate Office building after McCain, restarting the effort first proposed following the longtime lawmaker\u2019s passing last August, though the proposal appears to still be stalled. McCain shared a rocky relationship with President Donald Trump during his final term in Congress. The Arizona Republican\u00a0famously voted\u00a0twice to save Obamacare\u00a0\u2014\u00a0first in July 2017 and then against the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal effort the following September.

In 2007, shortly after announcing his second presidenital campaign, Biden was asked during an interview with Bill Maher to rate coal, terrorism, and high fructose corn syrup in terms of which was more likely to kill \u201cyour average American.\u201d Biden, who often touts the fact that he authored the very first climate change bill in the U.S. Senate, responded by ranking coal a higher threat than terrorism. \u201cAir that has too much coal in it, corn syrup next, then a terrorist attack,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is not in any way to diminish the fact that a terrorist attack is real. \u2026 But hundreds of thousands of people die and their lives are shortened because of coal plants, coal-fired plants and because of corn syrup.\u201d Biden echoed a similarly tough line in August 2007,\u00a0telling Grist he did not envision a role for \u201cclean coal\u201d \u2014 a phrase used to describe technological advancements that limit the pollution emitted through the excavation and burning of coal \u2014 if the country became energy independent, as his campaign pledged. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a role for clean coal in energy independence, but I do think there\u2019s a significant role for clean coal in the bigger picture of climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cClean-coal technology is not the route to go in the United States, because we have other, cleaner alternatives.\u201d At the time, Biden elaborated he was willing to invest in the development of \u201cclean coal\u201d provided it was only \u201cfor export.\u201d Biden continued his opposition until he\u00a0was tapped to serve as Barack Obama\u2019s running mate. As Obama had openly embraced \u201cclean coal\u201d while campaigning through Appalachia, Biden quickly adopted his position. The transition was tenuous as Biden found it difficult to shed his old views. In September 2008, while campaigning for the Democrat ticket in Ohio, Biden not only reverted to his old position, but also looped Obama in with him. \u201cWe\u2019re not supporting clean coal,\u201d he\u00a0said when questioned why the duo was supporting the energy source. \u201cGuess what, China is building two every week. Two dirty coal plants. And it\u2019s polluting the United States, it\u2019s causing people to die.\u201d When pushed, Biden added that if coal plants had to exist, they should only be allowed overseas and not \u201chere in America.\u201d \u201cChina is burning three hundred years of bad coal unless we figure out how to clean their coal up,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s going to ruin your lungs and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. No coal plants here in America. Build them, if they\u2019re going to build them over there, make them clean because they\u2019re killing you.\u201d The interaction, which was captured on video, went viral and was quickly incorporated into attacks ads by the Republican presidential ticket, led by the late-Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and former Gov. Sarah Palin (D-AK). In order to downplay the incident and undercut the GOP,\u00a0Obama\u2019s team claimed Biden\u2019s words were taken out of context. \u201cSenator Biden\u2019s point is that China is building coal plants with outdated technology every day, and the United States needs to lead by developing clean coal technologies,\u201d a spokesman for the campaign said at the height of the controversy. After\u00a0the dustup, Biden stuck to the message on clean coal for the rest of the campaign. \u201cBarack and I believe that clean coal is part of our energy future, a necessary part, and also a great export capacity,\u201d he told an audience in West Virginia in October 2008. When Obama and Biden were elected, however, their policies moved increasingly away from \u201cclean coal\u201d and towards the agenda of environmental activists, who wanted to see the energy source eradicated. In 2014, the Obama-Biden administration\u00a0signaled it was siding with the activists by unveiling new EPA regulations meant to cut carbon emissions by more than 30 percent. For miners across the country, the action seemed to confirm that Obama and Biden were serious about waging a \u201cwar on coal,\u201d as many Republican had previously claimed. To show their displeasure,\u00a0nearly a thousand members of the United Mine Workers of America, which endorsed Obama in 2008,\u00a0converged on the EPA building in Washington, D.C. to protest. \u201cWe fought for those progressive causes, and there are people today in the progressive movement who have forgotten us,\u201d one of the union\u2019s leaders said\u00a0at the time. \u201cIf you try to foist this devastation on Appalachia, on our brothers and sisters, we will remember.\u201d Unfortunately, the union was powerless in the face of the federal government. In total, more than 80,000 coal mining jobs were lost during Obama and Biden\u2019s tenure in the White House, the majority of the losses coming from West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The plan Biden proposed on Wednesday would go even further toward killing the few mining jobs that still exist in those states. The irony is that Biden has spent most of his campaign to date painting himself as the only Democrat that can bring states like Pennsylvania and Ohio back into the Democrat column after both went for Presidential Donald Trump in 2016.",

      "content": " Biden told a crowd consisting of union mine workers in the closing days of the 2008 race that he and then-candidate Barack Obama would be better for the coal industry than McCain, the Republican presidential nominee. \u201cLadies and gentleman, John McCain does not believe that clean coal is part of our future,\u201d Biden said before quoting a statement the late-Arizona senator made saying, \u2018in a perfect world we\u2019d like to transition away from coal entirely.\u2019 \u201cThat does not sound like a guy who is attacking us, saying \u2018we\u2019re not for clean coal.'\u201d To \u201creinforce\u201d his argument, Biden added that McCain and his running mate, then-Gov. Sarah Palin, had turned their backs on Appalachia and mineworkers by supporting tax cuts for oil companies \u2014 a move likely to boost petroleum production at the expense of coal. \u201cSo John, if you\u2019re listening,\u201d Biden said. \u201cStop this malarkey about who\u2019s for clean coal. \u2026 Look, Barack and I believe that clean coal is part of our energy future, a necessary part, and also a great export capacity.\u201d Biden proceeded to cite instances where he and Obama had voted to appropriate more funding for clean coal technology, including \u201ccarbon sequestration,\u201d so \u201cwe can use coal more and use it more friendly.\u201d Such technology, he claimed, would help \u201ccreate American jobs\u201d when exported to other countries. \u201cChina is building one coal-fired plant a week, its a dirty plant, they\u2019ve got three hundred years of dirty coal,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe can turn from a liability to an asset, we can actually develop technology \u2026 and export it, create American jobs and help them make the environment \u2026 a lot cleaner. This should be a win-win situation, folks.\u201d  Biden, who up until joining the Democrat ticket as Obama\u2019s running mate had himself claimed there was not \u201cmuch of a role for clean coal in energy independence,\u201d accused McCain and Palin of wanting to send America\u2019s \u201cenergy dollars\u201d to oil-rich nations overseas. \u201cThis is what we should be doing, investing in this technology, instead of pouring our energy dollars into the sands of Saudi Arabia and the pockets of Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be exporting homemade technology \u2026 we should become the engine of change.\u201d At the time of the West Virginia speech, the Democrats were attempting to turn back Republican attacks stemming from a gaffe Biden made in\u00a0 September 2008. In an interaction captured on\u00a0video\u00a0and quickly incorporated into\u00a0attacks ads, Biden was ambushed by an environmentalist while campaigning in Ohio and asked about his and Obama\u2019s support for \u201cclean coal.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not supporting clean coal,\u201d Biden\u00a0said looping Obama, who had campaigned on his support for the energy source during the primaries, in with him. \u201cGuess what, China is building two every week. Two dirty coal plants. And it\u2019s polluting the United States, it\u2019s causing people to die.\u201d When pushed by the environmentalist, Biden admitted that if coal plants had to exist, it was better that they were located anywhere but \u201chere in America.\u201d \u201cChina is burning three hundred years of bad coal unless we figure out how to clean their coal up,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s going to ruin your lungs and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. No coal plants here in America. Build them, if they\u2019re going to build them over there, make them clean because they\u2019re killing you.\u201d The incident quickly became politically controversial, especially as \u201cclean coal\u201d was a top issue the Obama campaign was relying on to court white working-class voters in areas like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and certain sections of the industrial Midwest. The Obama campaign attempted to do damage control by claiming that Biden\u2019s comments were being taken out of context for political points. Afterwards, Biden remained on message throughout the rest of the campaign and even sought out opportunities to go on the offensive against McCain and Palin, as evidenced by his remarks in West Virginia. The moment comes back into the spotlight after last week\u2019s Democrat presidential debate at which Biden implied he was in favor of banning coal and fracking outright if elected in 2020. \u201cWe would make sure it\u2019s\u00a0eliminated, and no more subsidies\u00a0for either one of those, any fossil fuel,\u201d Biden said when asked if there would be any place for fracking and coal in his administration.",

      "subtitle": "Newly released Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records of its interviews with senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr reveal that the FBI used Ohr as a conduit to \u201cpee dossier\u201d author British ex-spy Christopher Steele in 2016 and 2017, even after the FBI officially fired Steele for having unauthorized contacts with the media.",
      "author": "Kristina Wong",
      "content": " The questionable behavior by Ohr and the FBI during the investigation of the Trump campaign was revealed in FBI interview records known as \u201c302s\u201d recently obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch. \u201cOhr was corruptly used by the FBI as a conduit to Clinton spy Christopher Steele and the Clinton-DNC spy ring at Fusion, and we now have received 34 pages of \u2018302\u2019 report material from the FBI interviews of Ohr \u2014 documents that Congress has been seeking but have been unable to get for over a year,\u201d Judicial Watch said in a statement. The 302s also revealed other questionable practices by Ohr and the FBI throughout 2016 and up to the beginning of the special counsel investigation that began May 2017. Here are the top takeaways from the records: 1. The FBI fired Steele in November 2016 for leaking to the media but continued communicating with him through Ohr at least until May 2017. The 302s showed that after the FBI fired Steele in November 2016 for unauthorized contacts with the media, it continued through Ohr to receive information from him and sought to communicate with him through May 2017. Ohr, who had known Steele since 2007, had a meeting with him on July 30, 2016 \u2014 right before the FBI formally launched its investigation into Donald Trump, according to the 302s. But Ohr maintained contact with Steele after the election. Between late November 2016 and May 2017, Ohr spoke with Steele nearly a dozen times, and the FBI interviewed Ohr about those contacts often just days after.\u00a0The FBI documented their interviews with Ohr as 302s, or as official witness interviews. The 302s revealed that Ohr also met with Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, who hired Steele to produce the dossier. On December 10, 2016, Simpson gave Ohr a thumb drive containing research he believed to be from Steele. Ohr turned over the thumb drive to the FBI as evidence two days later. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) noted the oddity of the FBI terminating Steele but continuing to keep contact with him through Ohr and then interviewing Ohr as a witness:   Steele also knew Ohr was a conduit to the U.S. government, according to the 302s. After President Trump fired then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, Steele contacted Ohr to see if he was also going to be fired and who else he could use as a contact if so. 2. Ohr knew as early as July 2016 Steele wanted Trump to lose and that his dossier was opposition research going to the Clinton campaign. Despite the FBI documenting this in a 302 in late November 2016, it continued to use the dossier to apply for three more surveillance warrants on a former Trump campaign official without telling this to the court granting the warrants. According to the 302s, the FBI interviewed Ohr in late November 2016 about his meeting with Steele on July 30, 2016. Ohr said he knew Steele was working for Fusion GPS to dig up Trump\u2019s connections to Russia and also told them his wife, Nellie Ohr, was hired by Fusion GPS to do \u201copen source research.\u201d Ohr told them Fusion GPS\u2019s research would go to the Clinton campaign. Ohr passed on to the FBI that Steele was \u201cdesperate\u201d that Trump not get elected and was \u201cpassionate\u201d about him not being the U.S. president. Ohr also said Steele and Simpson could have met with Yahoo journalist Michael Isikoff jointly or separately but did not know if they did. Despite knowing this in late November, the FBI continued to use Steele\u2019s dossier and a September 23, 2016, Yahoo News article written by Isikoff as evidence to get a surveillance warrant on former Trump campaign official Carter Page without passing any of it on to the court granting the warrants. The FBI submitted applications for warrants in October 2016, January 2017, April 2017, and June 2017. Instead, the FBI said in a footnote in its application that Steele \u2014 or \u201cSource #1\u201d \u2014 \u201cwas approached by an unidentified U.S. person\u201d \u2014 or Simpson \u2014 who indicated to Steele that a \u201cU.S.-based law firm\u201d had hired him to conduct research on Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. \u201c[Simpson] never advised [Steele] as to the motivation behind the research into [Trump]\u2019s ties to Russia. The FBI speculates that [Simpson] was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit [Trump\u2019s] campaign,\u201d the FBI\u2019s applications said. The FBI also said in its FISA application that investigators did not believe Steele was a source for the story. 3. Steele maintained contact with State Department officials before and after the election. The 302s showed that, according to Ohr, Steele\u2019s research was going to the State Department in addition to the FBI, both before and after the election. Former Obama State Department official Jonathan Winer has admitted to passing on Steele\u2019s work to then-Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland. The 302s show that Fusion GPS\u2019s Simpson \u201cand others\u201d were speaking to Nuland directly. In addition, in February 2017, Ohr told the FBI that Steele told him he would be meeting with senior State Department official Kathleen Kavalec to \u201cdiscuss potential Russian influence in upcoming elections,\u201d and that she had also spoken to Steele several times before the election, but dates were not listed. The Daily Caller\u2019s Chuck Ross noted that it was the first time it has been revealed that Simpson was in contact with Nuland:  4. Steele met with someone in Sen. John McCain\u2019s office before the 2016 election. The 302s revealed for the first time that Steele met with someone from McCain\u2019s office before the election. Ohr told the FBI that Steele told him that he met with someone in McCain\u2019s office before October 2016 and that Steele did so \u201cat the request\u201d of someone whose name is redacted. It was later publicly reported that McCain had met with a Steele associate after the election at the 2016 Halifax Security Forum to discuss the dossier and arrange for his office to get a copy of it. That copy was later reportedly leaked to BuzzFeed, who published the dossier in January 2017. 5. Steele and Fusion GPS\u2019s Simpson pushed the idea that an Alfa Bank server in the U.S. was a link between Russia and the Trump campaign before and after the election. The 302s said Ohr said Steele told him late September that an Alfa Bank server in the U.S. was a link to the Trump campaign and Belarusian-American real estate developer Sergei Millian\u2019s organization. During Ohr\u2019s December 2016 meeting with Simpson, Simpson pushed the Alfa Bank story again and said he thought Millian oversaw transfers from Russia to the Trump campaign. During former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony in July, Mueller debunked the idea upon questioning from Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX). \u201cI believe it\u2019s not true,\u201d Mueller said. The interviews of Ohr continued through May 2017 when Mueller began his investigation. Republican members of the Judiciary Committee note the timing of the FBI\u2019s interviews of Ohr coincide with three major events tied to the president \u2014 after the 2016 election, right after Trump\u2019s inauguration, and right after former FBI Director James Comey was fired. \u201cThey were out to get the President,\u201d Jordan tweeted.  Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement after obtaining the records: \u201cThese new Bruce Ohr FBI 302s show an unprecedented and irregular effort by the FBI, DOJ, and State Department to dig up dirt on President Trump using the conflicted Bruce Ohr, his wife, and the Clinton/DNC spies at Fusion GPS,\u201d stated Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. \u201cThe FISA courts weren\u2019t informed of this corrupted process when they were asked to approve and reapprove extraordinary spy warrants targeting President Trump.\u201d Follow Kristina Wong at @kristina_wong.",

      "subtitle": "Before Joe Biden\u2019s persistent gaffes raised concerns over his electability in 2020, they were causing headaches for his runningmate, Barack Obama.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " In their 2010 book\u00a0Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime, John Heilemann and Mark Halperin noted the often tense relationship between Biden and Obama on the campaign trail. The duo, who never warmed to one another, either as U.S. senators or presidential rivals, were thrown together on the Democrat ticket because each had something the other was lacking. Biden, for his part, provided the partnership with decades of experience in both the domestic and foreign policy fronts. Obama, although young and naive to the workings of the federal bureaucracy, had the charisma and authenticity that Biden\u2019s two previous failed presidential bids had been missing. The political union, however, was quickly tested as Biden\u2019s penchant for gaffes, verbal missteps, and embarrassing comments played out in view of a national audience. The trouble began shortly after the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Biden, who during the primary campaign had lambasted Obama as unprepared for the presidency, found old habits to hard break. In mid-September 2008, Biden reportedly was \u201crunning his mouth\u201d to reporters on his new campaign plane when he let it be known that he was more qualified to be president than Obama. The remark quickly soured relations between Biden, Obama, and their respective staffs, according to Heilemann and Haperin. A chill set in between Chicago and the Biden plane. Joe and Obama barely spoke by phone, rarely campaigned together. Not only was Biden kept off Obama\u2019s nightly campaign conference call, he wasn\u2019t even told it existed. (When the idea of having Biden join was put to [campaign manager David] Plouffe, his response was \u2018nah.\u2019) A different daily call was set up for Joe, with [senior staff], so they could keep a tight reign on him. The bitterness only escalated from there, especially as Biden began making more frequent gaffes on the campaign trail. In the final week of September alone, Biden \u201cequated paying higher taxes with patriotism,\u201d told\u00a0voters both he and Obama were opposed to coal\u2014contrary to their platform \u2013 and second guessed the campaign\u2019s messaging strategy. In the wake of such gaffes, Obama purportedly told his staff to \u201cfix this problem with Biden,\u201d but refrained from getting involved himself. All of that changed two weeks before\u00a0Election Day, when Biden claimed at a fundraiser that Obama, if elected, would stare down an international crisis in his first six-months. The prophesy would not have stirred much concern, except Biden gave the impression to those in attendance and the media that he was \u201cshowing off\u201d for wealthy donors, and the crisis in question would be \u201cgenerated.\u201d \u201dMark my words,\u201d Biden told the crowd. \u201cIt will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy \u2026 Watch, we\u2019re gonna have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy.\u201d Biden\u2019s remarks proved to be a red line for Obama, as Heilemann and Halperin detailed in their book. On Obama\u2019s nightly call, the candidate hit the ceiling. ([Chief strategist David] Axelrod was already up there, needing to be peeled off, having let fly a string of F-bombs when he first found out what Biden had said.) \u2018Golly, man!\u2019 Obama said, with more anger in his voice than \u2018gollys\u2019 normally carry. He was, in fact, as pissed off as most people on the call had ever heard him, more so than he\u2019d been at even the wickedest jabs from Hillary Clinton. \u2018How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?\u2019\u201d Publicly Obama attempted to clean up the gift his runningmate had just given Republicans, who had began running ads using the comments immediately. \u201cI think Joe sometimes engages in rhetorical flourishes,\u201d Obama told The New York Times shortly after the incident. Privately, though, Obama was livid and not afraid to express his feelings to Biden during a private call between the men, which was described to Heilemann and Halperin: A couple of days later, Obama phoned Biden and laid into him. You were supposed to have my back, he said, not be out there creating problems\u2026. More than that, though, what rankled Obama was that Biden hadn\u2019t bothered to pick up the phone and apologize. Worse, Biden didn\u2019t say that he was sorry when Obama called; he showed no remorse for his \u2026 comments or understanding that they posed a real political problem. Despite the concerns, Obama and Biden went on to win the election by a substantial margin. There is some credence that Obama had cause to worry. National exit polls from the race showed the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), the Republican nominee, winning voters most concerned about \u201cterrorism\u201d by a margin of 86 percent to 13 percent. The episode comes back into the spotlight as Biden\u2019s own 2020 bid is weighed down by a surge of high-profile gaffes.\u00a0In tur, such blunder, have\u00a0reignited\u00a0existing doubts from the left over Biden\u2019s capabilities and fitness for the presidency. Obama, himself, has granted credence to such doubts by not endorsing his former runningmate and refusing to defend him in the wake of a recent controversy involving Biden\u2019s praise of segregationists. The true nature of Obama\u2019s feelings were only further illuminated last week, when it became public the former president attempted to dissuade Biden from running. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Joe, you really don\u2019t,\u201d Obama told Biden before the 76-year-old formally launched his campaign in April.",

      "content": " According to the far-left Axios, \u201cExamples from organizers include opening a dialogue with a competitor, committing to working with a colleague or peer with a different perspective and calling a family member you disagree with \u2014 and pledging to listen.\u201d A spokesman for the McCain Institute told the Hill, \u201cMy family and I are going out of our way to properly meet our (not so) new neighbors, who on the face of it we have little in common with.\u201d This is the dumbest thing ever, not to mention wildly hypocritical. Do we really need a lecture about civility from John McCain\u2019s widow, Cindy, who racially profiled a family, accused them of being human traffickers, and then lied and said they were guilty, all to self-aggrandize? Do we really need a lecture about civility from The Great White View Screecher? Do we really need a lecture about civility from a family that is so small and bitter they turned a national funeral into a disgusting and divisive campaign rally against the sitting U.S. president and his supporters? And this is just typical of the McCains, to pervert a virtue, in this case \u201ccivility,\u201d into an ego trip, into an effort to feel superior to us slobs, to get on TV, to speak down to everyone else because they are just so above it all. John McCain perfected this, the art of weaponizing virtues. His cynical ability to twist words like \u201chonor\u201d into an imperious spear that would win him and his insatiable ego a positive mention in the left-wing media was always his go-to move. And look at what most of this lame campaign centers on: imposing ourselves on others to make ourselves feel better about ourselves. How about just leaving these people the hell alone? We\u2019re supposed to honor the anniversary of McCain\u2019s death by being a pain in someone\u2019s ass? Where is the virtue in imposing yourself on others just to make yourself feel good? And why does it always work this way with establishment Republicans who adore the establishment media\u2026? Have you noticed that? Their idea of virtue, of nobility, is always a peacocking act of public surrender. How about if we honor John McCain with a day where we agree to stick by our principles, hold tight to our beliefs and what we believe is right, no matter how much pressure is brought down on us, no matter how many friends we lose, no matter how angry the fake news media get\u2026? How about a day like that? You know, like repealing Obamacare\u2026 Oh, wait:  Or a day where we agree to stop grinding axes, holding grudges, and move on for the good for the country\u2026? Oh, wait:  Or a day where we don\u2019t snub those who have been unfailingly loyal, just to appease the elite. Oh, wait. Or a day where we pledge not to allow our envy and jealousy to push us to a point where we spread vicious lies about each other\u2026? Oh, wait. Or a day where we don\u2019t leak smears about black men who dare to have minds of their own\u2026? Oh, wait. The horrible McCain family needs to sit down. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

MIKE MURPHY: No, the old theory on impeachment was that it would help the Republicans. I think that\u2019s out the window now. This is a much clearer incident than the Mueller report information. When the president released this transcript, you really have to parse your way through it to eliminate all subtext of no quid pro quo. I agree that it doesn\u2019t have to be a quid pro quo, but look at the context. The aid to Ukraine, the defense and military aid, was held up, the president of Ukraine asked for anti-tank missiles because he\u2019s got a problem with Russian mercenary tanks, and the president says \u201clet me talk to you about some other things, you know I\u2019m a great friend to Ukraine, but it hasn\u2019t really been paid back. Let\u2019s get into this Biden matter.\u201d It\u2019s a classic shake-down. That\u2019s going to be the argument. And I\u2019m telling you, these Senate Republicans,\u00a0should\u00a0the Democrats vote impeachment,\u00a0which is far more likely than\u00a0not,\u00a0are going to be pinned down to a yes-no answer.

      "author": "John Binder",

And it\u2019s excluding people for the wrong reasons.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re not walking the line, then you\u2019re out,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s just not right. That\u2019s not the party that my husband and I belonged to.\u201d McCain also seemed to take subtle jabs at Trump\u2019s way of communicating with his supporters, bypassing the establishment media and pundit class. \u201cI think we\u2019ve seen the end of men like my husband. At least for right now,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThe inability to even discuss issues \u2014 differing issues \u2014 it\u2019s degenerated into name-calling and Twitter responses, and all of these things that not only do they not help the argument, but they don\u2019t help foster good relationships with people,\u201d McCain said. While McCain\u2019s husband lost the 2008 presidential election running on the decades-long Republican establishment platform of neoconservative foreign interventionism, extending the Bush-era tax cuts, and amnesty for illegal aliens, Trump swept to victory in 2016 with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda of a travel ban from terrorist-sponsored countries, a promise to bring U.S. troops home, and a commitment to pulling out of multilateral free trade deals and global agreements like TPP and the Paris Climate Accord. Trump\u2019s economic nationalist platform won him majorities in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania \u2014 states not won by Republicans in years. In a March 2019 poll by Harvard/Harris, about three-in-four U.S. voters said they support a nationalist-populist approach to trade, immigration, and foreign policy \u2014 that is, tariffs on foreign imports to protect American industries, less immigration, and less foreign intervention overseas.

      "subtitle": "A spokesman for Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence denied any impropriety related to a trip taken by a staffer to Ukraine last month sponsored and organized by the Atlantic Council think tank.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " The Atlantic Council is funded by and works in partnership with Burisma, the natural gas company at the center of allegations regarding Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. The Schiff staff member, Thomas Eager, is also currently a fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Congressional Fellowship. Burisma in January 2017 signed a \u201ccooperative agreement\u201d with the Council to sponsor the organization\u2019s Eurasia Center. In a statement to Breitbart News, Schiff\u2019s office denied that Eager is or has been doing work related to the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint about President Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Schiff\u2019s House Intelligence Committee reportedly reached a tentative agreement in recent days for the so-called whistleblower to testify.\u00a0 The issue has been at the forefront of the agenda for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Patrick Boland, spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee, told Breitbart News: This was a bipartisan, bicameral congressional staff trip that was planned months in advance by a well-respected think tank that has worked for nearly sixty years to enhance and strengthen the transatlantic alliance. A committee staff member who is not part of the Committee\u2019s investigative team applied for and was accepted into the program in January of this year, the culmination of which was a study trip to Ukraine. While in Ukraine, the staffer followed the program of the organizers and did not undertake any other work on behalf of the committee or take additional meetings. Eager\u2019s trip to Ukraine last month was part of the fellowship program and included nine other House employees. The bi-partisan visit, from August 24 to August 31, was billed as a \u201cUkraine Study Trip,\u201d and culminated in a meeting with former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The dates of the pre-planned trip are instructive. Eager\u2019s visit to Ukraine sponsored by the Burisma-sponsored Atlantic Council began 12 days after the so-called whistleblower officially filed his August 12 complaint about Trump\u2019s request for Ukrainian assistance in investigating possible corruption related to the Burisma company and Joe and Hunter Biden. Also mentioned by Trump during the phone call with Zelensky are questions about CrowdStrike, the outside firm utilized to conclude that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers since the DNC would not allow the U.S. government to inspect the servers. CrowdStrike founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council. Burisma is not an uninvolved Atlantic Council donor. Burisma and the Atlantic Council announced in 2017 that they signed a \u201ccooperative agreement\u201d to promote a shared agenda. \u201cBurisma\u2019s support and cooperation will enable us to continue to expand our Ukraine programming and to provide new platforms for discussing these vital and timely issues,\u201d said John Herbst, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine and director of the Council\u2019s Dinu Patriciu Eurasia Center. Nikolay Zlochevskyi, president of the Burisma Group, commented on the arrangement: The Atlantic Council has played a vital role in Ukraine in championing transatlantic relations, democracy, and energy security. Mr. Herbst has been a tireless champion for Ukraine, and Burisma welcomes this opportunity to support the work of the Ambassador and the Atlantic Council. Four months ago, Burisma co-hosted the Council\u2019s second Annual Kharkiv Security Conference. Burisma further co-hosted a U.S.-Ukraine Business Council event with the Council last year in Washington, DC.\u00a0 David J. Kramer, who was a central figure in disseminating the anti-Trump dossier as a longtime adviser to the late John McCain, is a senior adviser to the Business Council. Dossier Geysha Gonzalez is the Atlantic Council officer listed in public disclosure forms as the point of contact for Eager\u2019s trip to Ukraine with the Council. She is deputy director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center. Gonzalez is also one of eleven members of the rapid response team for the Ukrainian Election Task Force, which says it is working to expose \u201cforeign interference in Ukraine\u2019s democracy.\u201d Another member of the team is Kramer, who served at the McCain Institute for International Leadership as senior director for human rights and democracy. Kramer revealed in testimony that he held a meeting about the anti-Trump dossier with a reporter from BuzzFeed News who he says snapped photos of the controversial document without Kramer\u2019s permission when he left the room to go to the bathroom. That meeting was held at the McCain Institute office in Washington, Kramer stated. BuzzFeed infamously published the Christopher Steele dossier on January 10, 2017 setting off a firestorm of news media coverage about the document. The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported last February that Kramer received the dossier directly from Fusion GPS after McCain expressed interest in it. McCain, in turn, passed the dossier document to then-FBI Director James Comey. In a deposition taken on Dec. 13, 2017 and posted online earlier this year, Kramer revealed that he met with two Obama administration officials to inquire about whether the anti-Trump dossier was being taken seriously. In one case, Kramer said that he personally provided a copy of the dossier to Obama National Security Council official Celeste Wallander. In the deposition, Kramer said that McCain specifically asked him in early December 2016 to meet about the dossier with Wallander and Victoria Nuland, a senior official in John Kerry\u2019s State Department. Schiff signed form Schiff\u2019s signature appears on the required post-travel disclosure form filed with the House Committee on Ethics documenting the visit to Ukraine. The form signed by Schiff says that Eager\u2019s trip to Ukraine was paid for by the \u201cAtlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\u201d  The form bearing Schiff\u2019s signature (above) describes the visit thusly: Series of meetings and visits with gov\u2019t officials, party officials, civil society and private sector reps in Ukraine to learn about ongoing political and military issues, including conflict in the East. The costs for Eager\u2019s visit listed on the form are $2202.91 for transportation, $985.50 for lodging, and $630.15 for meal expenses. Gonzalez of the Atlantic Council told Breitbart News that Eager started his one year fellowship with the organization in January and that Eager is still a fellow. Gonzalez said the pre-planned trip was part of the fellowship program, which also includes a full year of round tables and other educational events. She said it was not within her portfolio to comment on issues of funding from Burisma or other donors. The itinerary of the trip shows a meeting with Poroshenko as well as discussions with local activists, politicians and residents. Besides Eager, nine other Congressional staffers were listed as participating in the visit. Republicans were represented by Laura Detter, legislative assistant to Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA), Zachery Laven, legislative assistant to Rep. David Schweikert (R-AZ), Michael McCabe, legislative assistant to Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) and Sarah Miller, legislative assistant to Rep. Brian Mast (R-FL). Common Funding Themes There are common threads that run through an organization repeatedly relied upon in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Trump and CrowdStrike. One of several themes is financing tied to Google, whose Google Capital led a $100 million funding drive that financed Crowdstrike. Google Capital, which now goes by the name of CapitalG, is an arm of Alphabet Inc., Google\u2019s parent company. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, has been a staunch and active supporter of Hillary Clinton and is a longtime donor to the Democratic Party. CrowdStrike was mentioned by Trump in his call with Zelensky. Perkins Coie, the law firm that represented the DNC and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, reportedly helped draft CrowdStrike to aid with the DNC\u2019s allegedly hacked server. On behalf of the DNC and Clinton\u2019s campaign, Perkins Coie also paid the controversial Fusion GPS firm to produce the infamous, largely-discredited anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele. CrowdStrike founder Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, which takes a hawkish approach toward Russia. The Council in turn is financed by Google Inc. and Burisma. Besides Google and Burisma funding, the Council is also financed by billionaire activist George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations as well as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc. and the U.S. State Department. Google, Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint alleging Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country\u201d in the 2020 presidential race. The charges in the July 22 report referenced in the whistleblower\u2019s document and released by the Google and Soros-funded organization, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s own claims, as Breitbart News documented. One key section of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document claims that \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.\u201d This was allegedly to follow up on Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky in order to discuss the \u201ccases\u201d mentioned in that call, according to the so-called whistleblower\u2019s narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations. Even though the statement was written in first person \u2013 \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me\u201d \u2013 it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). That footnote reads: In a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir. The so-called whistleblower\u2019s account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to: The OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a \u201cjoint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.\u201d BuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit. The OCCRP and BuzzFeed \u201cjoint investigation\u201d resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals. The so-called whistleblower\u2019s document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims. Another listed OCCRP funder is the Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. Together with Soros\u2019s Open Society, Omidyar also funds the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which hosts the International Fact-Checking Network that partnered with Facebook to help determine whether news stories are \u201cdisputed.\u201d Like OCCRP, the Poynter Institute\u2019s so-called news fact-checking project is openly funded by not only Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations but also Google and the National Endowment for Democracy. CrowdStrike and DNC servers CrowdStrike, meanwhile, was brought up by Trump in his phone call with Zelensky. According to the transcript, Trump told Zelensky, \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d In his extensive report, Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller notes that his investigative team did not \u201cobtain or examine\u201d the servers of the DNC in determining whether those servers were hacked by Russia. The DNC famously refused to allow the FBI to access its servers to verify the allegation that Russia carried out a hack during the 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, the DNC reached an arrangement with the FBI in which CrowdStrike conducted forensics on the server and shared details with the FBI. In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey confirmed that the FBI registered \u201cmultiple requests at different levels,\u201d to review the DNC\u2019s hacked servers. Ultimately, the DNC and FBI came to an agreement in which a \u201chighly respected private company\u201d\u2014a reference to CrowdStrike\u2014would carry out forensics on the servers and share any information that it discovered with the FBI, Comey testified. A senior law enforcement official stressed the importance of the FBI gaining direct access to the servers, a request that was denied by the DNC. \u201cThe FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated,\u201d the official was quoted by the news media as saying. \u201cThis left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier,\u201d the official continued. Biden, Ukraine and Burisma Ukraine in 2016 removed a key prosecutor probing alleged corruption involving Burisma, the same firm paying Hunter Biden. Joe Biden two years later admitted to personally threatening to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine unless the prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was removed. Biden publically boasted about his role in the removal of Shokin during a panel discussion sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018. \u201cI remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team \u2026 that we should be providing for loan guarantees. \u2026 And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, \u2026 we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, \u2018You have no authority. You\u2019re not the president.\u2019 \u2026 I said, call him. I said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. \u2026 I looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d After it was revealed that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014, ethics experts were quoted by the news media as raising questions about potential conflicts of interest.

      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": " The Associated Press (AP)\u00a0published a feature on Clinton entitled \u201cDemocrats\u2019 2020 race has a new shadow: Hillary Clinton,\u201d that points out she is different than others who have lost a presidential election: Sitting senators like Democrat John Kerry and Republican John McCain returned quietly to Capitol Hill. Democrat Al Gore became a leading advocate for climate action. McCain\u2019s running mate, Sarah Palin, has made perhaps the biggest recent splash as a conservative media sensation who helped stoke a base that ultimately embraced Trump. A former aide to Clinton in 2016 went as far as to say many people think she deserves to be on the national stage. \u201cThere are people who believe she won \u2014 or should have won,\u201d Karen Finney said in the AP article. Finney said Clinton \u201cis in her own category\u201d and a \u201cglobal figure.\u201d But some people aren\u2019t as thrilled with Clinton\u2019s meddling in the 2020 election, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who didn\u2019t get the Democrat nomination in 2016 but hopes to this election cycle. Sanders shamed Clinton on her recent remarks about Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) being a Russian favorite.  \u201cTulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,\u201d Sanders tweeted on Monday. \u201cPeople can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.\u201d \u201cGabbard retorted by calling Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers \u2026 and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long,\u201d AP reported. Larry Cohen, who is a Sanders supporter, praised and then warned Clinton in the AP report. Hillary \u201cput a lifetime into the Democratic Party. She deserves to be heard,\u201d said Cohen, who is also on the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIn this senior leader role she has \u2026 it\u2019s her job to embrace the range of politics within the party and not polarize within it.\u201d AP reported: Her scuffle with Gabbard and other recent headlines she\u2019s driven demonstrate that the 71-year-old remains a political lightning rod, just as she\u2019s been through much of the last three decades.\u00a0 The dynamics raise questions about how Clinton and her party can best leverage her strengths and navigate her weaknesses through next November. Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, defended his boss in the AP report. \u201cThe short of it is that she\u2019s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but it\u2019s as simple as that. She\u2019s out there telling the truth.\u201d \u201cFinney predicts Clinton \u2018will be out on the trail in 2020,\u2019 if not for the nominee, then for \u2018any of the record number of women who will be running\u2019 for other offices,\u201d AP reported.

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " \u201cBlack Americans have never had a better champion than President Trump,\u201d said Katrina Pierson, Senior Advisor at Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. \u201cThe Black Voices for Trump coalition will be a national effort to mobilize and empower Black Americans who support President Trump to help get the message of \u2018Promises Made, Promises Kept\u2019 into communities across America.\u201d The press release adds, \u201cUnder President Trump, unemployment for African Americans has reached historic lows and nearly 1.4 million new jobs have been added for African Americans. Black Americans strong support for President Trump will ensure a second term for the President.\u201d Hallelujah! Amen! THIS is why I support Trump. My entire adult life, I have been waiting for the Party of Lincoln to be the real Party of Lincoln, and make a serious, focused, and yes \u2014 risky effort to attract the black vote. John McCain didn\u2019t have the courage to do this. Mitt Romney gave it one try before he ran away scared and crying. Not Trump, though. Despite the best efforts of the fake media and Democrats (but I repeat myself) to smear him as racist, to mock his every attempt to reach out to blacks, to turn every black person who does support Trump into a \u201cCrazy Uncle Tom,\u201d Trump will not be intimidated. And he shouldn\u2019t be\u2026 And not just because some pollsters show him making inroads with groups the cowardly, establishment GOP have ignored for decades. To begin with, unlike our first black president, Trump actually has a record of accomplishment to run on, a record that has directly benefited black Americans: record-low unemployment, rising wages, job creation, and the long overdue criminal justice reform that Obama couldn\u2019t get through congress. Trump\u2019s relentless battle to stop illegal immigration is another area he can focus on. Illegal aliens steal crucial manual labor jobs that should be filled by inner-city youths looking for work, and these jobs oftentimes lead to learning a skilled-trade and the union benefits that come with it. Cheap, illegal labor also depress wages, especially among the working class. Let\u2019s not forget Trump\u2019s embrace of charter schools and school choice, two issues wildly popular with black voters that Democrats oppose because they care more about that teacher union money than the fate of black kids stuck in failing, inner-city public schools. As of right now, the Democrat frontrunner, Elizabeth Warren, is literally promising to destroy charter schools. Finally, there is just the little matter of showing you care enough about black Americans to go out and ask for their vote. This is the thing that has always driven me crazy about previous Republican candidates. Think about this\u2026 What are you telling an entire swath of Americans when you write off their vote, and yet the establishment GOP has been doing this cycle after cycle for decades. Why? Because, unlike Trump, who is willing to take risks, they have all been cowards afraid of a bad news cycle, scared of being seen as a failure, of getting booed, so better to be seen as indifferent. Look at what Trump is doing right now\u2026 Rushing head-first into the Kentucky\u00a0 and Louisiana governor\u2019s races, two contests every modern Republican president would have ignored in order to risk being seen as weak if Democrats prevail there. It was the same thing during the 2018 mid-terms. Trump was all over the country relentlessly campaigning to make that race about him, and my guess is that he saved the U.S. Senate and made the difference in keeping the governorships in Georgia and Florida. Aggressively pursuing the black vote is also smart politics. Due to a gutless Republican establishment, Democrats have been allowed to take the black vote for granted for 50 years, and for 50 years they have, and if you want to see what that looks like, I encourage you to visit Baltimore, South Central, Detroit, and Washington DC. It\u2019s outrageous that Democrats have been allowed unchallenged rule over their disastrous kingdoms for a half-century. Fearing failure, fearing a few boos, the GOP has allowed this to happen, even though everyone knows the Democrat coalition is a \u00a0Jenga Tower of special interest groups, and if the Republican black vote ever increases from single digits to something closer to 20 percent, Democrats are doomed. When the Never Trump, establishment losers harrumph about the \u201cParty of Lincoln,\u201d it is always within the context of appeasing the media and Democrats, of condescending to black America with the \u201capproved words,\u201d or not speaking certain truths that create the tension that comes with challenging 50 years of establishment failures. The Party of Lincoln should not be surrendering to bad ideas and fascist speech codes. No, the Party of Lincoln should be taking the risks to crusade for every black vote, and backing up that crusade with a record of accomplishment and opportunity, with a willingness to call out 50 years of proven Democrat failures, 50 years of GOP cowardice, and to put on the display of simple human decency that comes with saying, \u201cI want your support and I intend to earn it.\u201d Even the date of this initiative, November 8, is meant to tell black Americans their vote matters to Trump \u2014 it is exactly one year before Election Day.

      "subtitle": "Eric Ciaramella, whom Real Clear Investigations suggests is the likely so-called whistleblower, was part of an Obama administration email chain celebrating the eventual signing of a $1 billion U.S. loan guarantee to Ukraine.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " That and other emails show Ciaramella interfaced about Ukraine with individuals who played key roles in facilitating the infamous anti-Trump dossier produced by Fusion GPS and reportedly financed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. One of those individuals, then-Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland (pictured), received updates on Ukraine issues from dossier author Christopher Steele in addition to Nuland\u2019s direct role in the dossier controversy. Also part of the email chains was Christopher J. Anderson, who was a special adviser to former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker. Anderson testified to the Democrat-led House committees running the impeachment inquiry. Ciaramella\u2019s name comes up in six Obama-era government emails that were released by the State Department as part of two previous Freedom of Information Act requests.\u00a0 At the time of the exchanges, Ciaramella served as the Director for Baltic and Eastern European Affairs for the Obama-era National Security Council, where he worked on Ukraine policy.\u00a0 He is now an analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. One email, titled, \u201cLoan Guarantee,\u201d involved Nuland, who was reportedly a key champion of the Ukraine loan guarantee policy. \u201cHurray,\u201d a celebratory Nuland wrote in response to a translated Ukrainian government announcement about the signing of the $1 billion loan guarantee.\u00a0 The announcement singles out Joe Biden as being present for the conclusion of an agreement leading to the loan guarantee. Ciaramella was one of several people CC\u2019d in the email, which was sent from the U.S. ambassador at the time, Geoffrey Pyatt, who was another key champion of the loan guarantee to Ukraine along with Nuland. The email is one of several that shows Ciaramella in the loop with top officials such as Nuland working on Ukraine policy under the Obama administration. The loan guarantee was pushed through after Ukraine agreed to several reforms, especially the firing of the nation\u2019s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. This at a time that Shokin was reportedly investigating Burisma, the Ukranian natural gas company paying Hunter Biden.\u00a0 Joe Biden infamously boasted on video about personally threatening to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine unless Shokin was removed. Another released email shows Ciaramella himself sending a message to Nuland and others. Most of the contents are blocked out, including the email\u2019s subject line. One non-classified section of that email shows a reply stating, \u201cEmbassy Kyiv \u2014 coordinated with our USAID mission folks \u2014 will have detailed input tomorrow.\u201d One email involving Nuland was sent two days before the loan guarantee was signed on June 3, 2016. \u201cCan you confirm who will be doing the actual signing for each side?\u201d the exchange asked. Nuland has come under repeated fire for her various roles in the anti-Trump dossier controversy. FBI notes also cite career Justice Department official Bruce Ohr as saying that Nuland was in touch with Fusion GPS co-founder and dossier producer Glenn Simpson. Sen. John McCain, who infamously delivered the dossier to then-FBI Director James Comey, reportedly first dispatched an aide, David J. Kramer, to inquire with Nuland about the dossier claims. In their book, Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin\u2019s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, authors and reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn write that Nuland gave the green light for the FBI to first meet with Steele regarding his dossier\u2019s claims. It was at that meeting that Steele initially reported his dossier charges to the FBI, the book relates. Meanwhile, looped into email chains with Ciaramella was then-Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s chief of staff at the State Department, John Finer. An extensive New Yorker profile of Steele named Finer as obtaining the contents of a two-page summary of the dossier and eventually deciding to share the questionable document with Kerry. Finer reportedly received the dossier summary from Jonathan M. Winer, the Obama State Department official who acknowledged regularly interfacing and exchanging information with Steele, according to the report. Winer previously conceded that he shared the dossier summary with Nuland. After his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with Steele. Winer further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an \u201cold friend.\u201d Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal \u2013 which Winer in turn gave to Steele \u2013 originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals. In testimony last year, Nuland made statements about a meeting at the State Department in October 2016 between State officials and Steele, but said that she didn\u2019t participate. At a June 2018 hearing, Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) revealed contents of the State Department\u2019s visitor logs while he was grilling Nuland. At the hearing, Burr asked: \u201cI know you talked extensively with our staff relative to Mr. Steele. Based upon our review of the visitor logs of the State Department, Mr. Steele visited the State Department briefing officials on the dossier in October of 2016. Did you have any role in that briefing?\u201d \u201cI did not,\u201d Nuland replied. \u201cI actively chose not to be part of that briefing.\u201d \u201cBut were you aware of that briefing?\u201d Burr asked. \u201cI was not aware of it until afterwards,\u201d Nuland retorted. Nuland did not explain how she can actively chose not to be part of Steele\u2019s briefing, as she claimed, yet say she was unaware of the briefing until after it occurred. Nuland was not asked about the discrepancy during the public section of the testimony, which was reviewed in full by Breitbart News. Nuland previously served as chief of staff to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott under Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, and then served as deputy director for former Soviet Union affairs. Nuland faced confirmation questions prior to her most recent appointment as assistant secretary of state over her reported role in revising controversial Obama administration talking points about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks. Her reported changes sought to protect Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department from accusations that it failed to adequately secure the woefully unprotected U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi. Likely \u2018whistleblower\u2019 A RealClearInvestigations report by investigative journalist and author Paul Sperry named Ciaramella as best fitting the description of the so-called whistleblower. Officials with direct knowledge of the proceedings say Ciaramella\u2019s name has been raised in private in impeachment depositions and during at least one House open hearing that was not part of the formal impeachment proceedings. Federal documents show Ciaramella also worked closely with Joe Biden and worked under Susan Rice, President Obama\u2019s national security adviser. He also worked with former CIA Director John Brennan, an anti-Trump advocate who has faced controversy for his role in fueling the questionable Russia collusion investigation.\u00a0 Rice participated in Russia collusion probe meetings and reportedly unmasked senior members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Sperry cites former White House officials saying Ciaramella worked for Biden on Ukrainian policy issues in 2015 and 2016, encompassing the time period for which Biden has been facing possible conflict questions for leading Ukraine policy in light of Hunter Biden\u2019s work for Burisma. Mark Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, the activist attorneys representing the so-called whistleblower, refused to confirm on deny that their secretive client is indeed Ciaramella. \u201cWe neither confirm nor deny the identity of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower,\u201d the lawyers told the Washington Examiner in response to an inquiry about Ciaramella. Zaid and Bakaj added, \u201cOur client is legally entitled to anonymity. Disclosure of the name of any person who may be suspected to be the whistleblower places that individual and their family in great physical danger. Any physical harm the individual and/or their family suffers as a result of disclosure means that the individuals and publications reporting such names will be personally liable for that harm. Such behavior is at the pinnacle of irresponsibility and is intentionally reckless.\u201d On Sunday, Trump responded to press reports naming Ciaramella, calling him a \u201cradical\u201d known for his close ties to Brennan and Rice. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you what. There have been stories written about a certain individual, a male, and they say he\u2019s the whistleblower,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cIf he\u2019s the whistleblower, he has no credibility because he\u2019s a Brennan guy, he\u2019s a Susan Rice guy, he\u2019s an Obama guy.\u201d Trump added, \u201cAnd he hates Trump. And he\u2019s a radical. Now, maybe it\u2019s not him. But if it\u2019s him, you guys ought to release the information.\u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
