      "content": " In an ABC News interview slated to air Wednesday,\u00a0McCain lamented today\u2019s congressional bipartisanship, saying her late husband stood up to Democrats and Republicans for the sake of breaking gridlock. \u201cThat was a tough torch to carry and, as John said, there were many lonely days because he always said what was on his mind,\u201d McCain recounted. \u201cI don\u2019t see anybody carrying that mantle at all, I don\u2019t see anyone carrying the voice\u00a0\u2014 the voice of reason,\u201d she added. Of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a longtime ally of Sen. McCain who has closely aligned himself with President Trump since the Arizona Republicans passing, McCain refused to speak out against him. \u201cLindsey\u2019s a part of my family,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good friend and I cannot, [and] will not, be critical of Lindsey.\u201d \u201cLindsey has his own political career to worry about and his own political life,\u201d she added. \u201cI would just hope that in the long run, everyone would begin to move in the right direction, including Lindsey or anybody else.\u201d McCain\u2019s comments come as\u00a0The McCain Institute readies a\u00a0social media campaign promoting civility to commemorate Sen. McCain\u2019s August 25th death from\u00a0glioblastoma, an aggressive form of\u00a0brain cancer. On Wednesday, McCain previewed the\u00a0\u201c#ActsofCivility\u201d\u00a0initiative in the video asking others to \u201creach across the aisle\u201d and \u201ccome together for civil engagement.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) lambasted President Donald Trump\u2019s joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir in Helsinki, Finland on Monday.",
      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " The Arizona\u00a0senator released a statement describing President Trump\u2019s remarks during the press conference as \u201cpathetic,\u201d disgraceful,\u201d and \u201cpainful\u201d to observe \u2014 \u201ca recent low point in the history of the American Presidency.\u201d  \u201cToday\u2019s press conference in Helsinki was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory. The damage inflicted by President Trump\u2019s naivet\u00e9, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate. But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake,\u201d Sen. McCain\u2019s statement begins.\u00a0\u201cPresident Trump proved not only unable, but unwilling to stand up to Putin. He and Putin seemed to be speaking from the same script as the president made a conscious choice to defend a tyrant against the fair questions of a free press, and to grant Putin an uncontested platform to spew propaganda and lies to the world.\u201d It is tempting to describe the press conference as a pathetic rout \u2013 as an illustration of the perils of under-preparation and inexperience. But these were not the errant tweets of a novice politician. These were the deliberate choices of a president who seems determined to realize his delusions of a warm relationship with Putin\u2019s regime without any regard for the true nature of his rule, his violent disregard for the sovereignty of his neighbors, his complicity in the slaughter of the Syrian people, his violation of international treaties, and his assault on democratic institutions throughout the world. McCain highlighted the coziness between President Trump and his Russian counterpoint in contrast to his tough talk towards the United States\u2019 European allies. Last Wednesday, President Trump scolded Germany during a breakfast with NATO officials in Brussel over Berlin\u2019s support\u00a0of a Baltic Sea gas pipeline deal with the Kremlin, describing Europe\u2019s largest economy as a \u201ccaptive of Russians.\u201d In an interview with British tabloid The Sun,\u00a0President\u00a0 Trump predicted the British government\u2019s proposed watered down Brexit strategy \u201cwill probably kill\u201d hopes of a bilateral trade agreement with the United States. Ahead of his high-stakes meeting with Putin, President Trump branded the European Union a \u201cfoe\u201d in respect to trade. \u201cComing close on the heels of President Trump\u2019s bombastic and erratic conduct towards our closest friends and allies in Brussels and Britain, today\u2019s press conference marks a recent low point in the history of the American Presidency,\u201d the statement continues.\u201d That the president was attended in Helsinki by a team of competent and patriotic advisors makes his blunders and capitulations all the more painful and inexplicable.\u201d McCain concluded his blistering statement by accusing Trump of failing to uphold American values abroad, something he claims the president has failed to do since winning the White House. \u201cNo prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant. Not only did President Trump fail to speak the truth about an adversary; but speaking for America to the world, our president failed to defend all that makes us who we are\u2014a republic of free people dedicated to the cause of liberty at home and abroad. American presidents must be the champions of that cause if it is to succeed,\u201d McCain said. \u201cAmericans are waiting and hoping for President Trump to embrace that sacred responsibility. One can only hope they are not waiting totally in vain.\u201d Presidents Trump and Putin vowed a fresh start to troubled relations between the world\u2019s greatest nuclear powers at their summit, as the American leader rejected a chance to condemn Moscow\u2019s alleged manipulation of U.S. elections. Standing alongside Putin at a joint news conference, President Trump said he had \u201cspent a great deal of time talking about\u201d election meddling, without going into detail or explicitly condemning any interference\u00a0after 12 Russian agents were indicted in the United States. When pressed about alleged meddling, President Trump stressed that Putin had delivered a \u201cpowerful\u201d denial of any Russian vote meddling and said the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller had been a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the United States. President Trump again denied any collusion between his campaign and the Kremlin, while Putin insisted: \u201cThe Russian state has never interfered and is not planning to interfere in the USA\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d The\u00a0Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.",

      "subtitle": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s Health Care Freedom Act, known as the \u201cskinny repeal\u201d bill, failed to pass through the Senate.",
      "author": "Sean Moran",
      "content": " The Health Care Freedom Act failed 49-51. Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) voted against the bill. Sens. McCain and Murkowski pledged repeatedly to repeal Obamacare, whereas Sen. Collins consistently voted against any Obamacare repeal proposed by the Senate. Not only have these Sens. McCain and Murkowski\u00a0voted to repeal Obamacare, they publicly pledged to do so on the campaign trail and in the halls of the Senate. Here are two instances when\u00a0these senators promised to repeal Obamacare: The Health Care Freedom Act would have repealed Obamacare\u2019s individual and employer mandate, provided states flexibility on\u00a0Obamacare insurance regulations through waivers, increased Health Savings Account (HSA) contribution limits, repealed Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax, and defunded Planned Parenthood for one year. The Senate healthcare reform process already traversed a rocky path. The Senate\u2019s motion to start debating healthcare legislation barely passed through the upper chamber at 51-50. Vice President Mike Pence had to break the tie after Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK)\u00a0voted\u00a0against starting the debate in Congress. The Senate leadership failed to pass its healthcare bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), and Senator Rand Paul\u2019s (R-KY) clean repeal bill failed in the Senate after moderate Republicans\u00a0shot down\u00a0the legislation. Vice President Mike Pence arrived shortly before the Senate voted on the Health Care Freedom Act.  Vice President Mike Pence was present at the Senate for the vote. The Senate shot down Sen. Patty Murray\u2019s (D-WA) motion to recommit the bill to the Senate Health, Labor, Education, and Pensions (HELP) committee, where Democrats argue that they can negotiate a bipartisan deal on health care with Republicans. The Senate failed to pass the Health Care Freedom Act. Senate Republicans needed at least 50 votes and Vice President Mike Pence to pass the bill through the upper chamber. Congressional leaders sought to send the Health Care Freedom Act to the House and the Senate, where both chambers could\u00a0compromise\u00a0on a unified bill through a conference committee. After which, both houses would have to pass the unified bill and then send the bill to President Donald Trump to sign. President Donald Trump cheered on the Senate Republicans before the vote, urging them to finally pass a health care reform bill after seven years.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell addressed the Senate Friday morning. McConnell regretfully said: Mr. President this is clearly a disappointing moment. From skyrocketing costs, to plummeting choices, and collapsing markets, our constituents have suffered an awful lot under Obamacare. We thought they deserved better, it\u2019s why I and many of my colleagues did as we promised and voted to repeal this failed law. We told our constituents we would vote that way, but when the moment came most of us did. We kept our commitments, we worked hard, and everyone on this side can attest to the fact that we worked really hard. We tried to develop a consensus for a way forward and I want to thank everyone in our conference for the endless amount of time that they spent trying to achieve a consensus to go forward. I also want to thank the President and the Vice President, both of them could not have been more involved and more helpful. So yes, this is a disappointment. A disappointment indeed. McConnell then challenged the Democrats to come up with a solution to the nation\u2019s health care crisis brought on\u00a0by Obamacare. McConnell asked, \u201cNow I think it is appropriate to ask what are their ideas?\u201d \u201cNow it\u2019s time for the other side to put their ideas forward and we\u2019ll see how the American people feel about their ideas,\u201d the Majority Leader added. McConnell concluded, \u201cMy only regret, our only regret tonight, that we didn\u2019t achieve what we had hoped to accomplish. I think the American people are going to regret that we couldn\u2019t find a better way forward.\u201d  ",

      "author": "Katie McHugh",
      "content": " The amendment proposed by New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen \u2014 and supported by McCain \u2014 will increase the number of Afghan Special Immigrant Visas for people who have aided U.S. soldiers as interpreters or translators. The number of visas will rise from 7,000 to 11,000, and each visa holder can bring spouses and their children to the United States. \u201cIt is time for the Senate to stop treating U.S. immigration policy like a Christmas tree that they can simply add more baubles to on a whim,\u201d a press release from NumbersUSA sent to Senate offices Monday read. \u201cAmericans have to pay for each of those baubles \u2014 through higher taxes, fewer jobs, lower wages, and, tragically, higher health care costs for soldiers and their families.\u201d McCain\u2019s office declined to respond to queries from Breitbart News. Congress cut healthcare benefits to veterans in the 2016 budget by increasing pharmacy co-pays \u2014 using some of those savings to fund an expansion of the Afghan Special Immigrant Visas program, according to The Daily Caller News Foundation. The money could have been taken from other spending accounts, such as programs at the State Department. Backers of the amendment plan to do more of the same, says NumbersUSA: \u201cOnce again, shamefully, the proposed pay-for apparently will be on the backs of our soldiers and their families in higher-priced health care.\u201d The\u00a0war in violent, tribal, Third World Afghanistan has cost American taxpayers $1.6 trillion\u00a0since 9/11, according to a 2014 Congressional Research Office estimate. It has taken the lives of over 2,300 U.S. soldiers, on top of over\u00a020,000 U.S.\u00a0soldiers wounded or maimed. But Republicans and Democrats have united to pile more costs onto taxpayers and military families. NumbersUSA explained the wide range of taxpayer-funded programs the Afghanis are eligible to receive. \u201cRecipients are entitled to every benefit to which refugees are entitled, including travel loans, eight months of refugee cash and medical assistance, social services, up to five years of job training, job placement, and English classes,\u201d along with employment authorization and a Social Security number. The SSN allows them to claim\u00a0Earned Income Tax Credits and Additional Child Tax Credits. Every child born on U.S. soil is\u00a0automatically awarded U.S. citizenship, thanks to liberal Supreme Court Justice William Brennan\u2019s 1982 footnote in Plyler v. Doe.\u00a0They, in turn, can sponsor \u201crelatives\u201d\u00a0to join them in the U.S., whether or not American communities prefer to have impoverished, tribal, devout Muslims resettled en-masse into their neighborhoods. This is\u00a0thanks to the 51-year long\u00a0chain migration\u00a0tradition of giving migrants control over U.S. immigration policy, successfully advocated by Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy and his\u00a0Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. In addition, they are eligible for federal entitlement programs and other benefits, including but not limited to: It\u2019s a remarkable bargain for interpreters who aided the U.S. in their native country. The\u00a0Afghan Special Immigrant Visas program was created in 2009 and continued to grow as modifications were made. Despite its expansion, thousands of visas still remain unclaimed, NumbersUSA says: As of April 7 of this year, the Department of State still had 3,635 visas available to issue. Notably, the visa cap applies only to principal alien applicants \u2014 with an uncapped number going to each applicant\u2019s spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21. So in FY 2014, while 3,441 visas were issued to principal aliens, 5,666 were issued to their dependents. In FY 2015, 2,301 were issued to principals, and 4,411 to dependents. As of December 31 of 2015, 1,367 had been issued to principals and 2,942 to their dependents. But there\u2019s still years left to apply: The McCain-backed amendment requires a report \u201cdetailing a strategy for bringing the program to a responsible end\u201d should be written by December 31, 2019 \u2014 or \u201csoon thereafter,\u201d depending on continued U.S. military involvement. President Obama announced in\u00a0October 2015\u00a0that he would keep U.S. troops in Afghanistan until the end of his term in 2017. ",

But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cWith his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.\u201d The longtime Republican lawmaker, who has remained away from Capitol Hill since December, began medical treatment for this cancer in July of 2017. \u201cMr. McCain\u2019s family has gathered in Arizona, and people close to him say his death is imminent,\u201d a source told the New York Times. McCain has been one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most vocal Republican critics, given Trump\u2019s infamous campaign-trail insult of his Vietnam War captivity. The senator wrote in his book Restless Wave that today\u2019s GOP is on the wrong side of the immigration debate. \u201cRight now, Republicans are on the wrong side of that progress,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd if we want to retain our competitiveness in the fastest-growing communities in the country we\u2019ll stop letting the zealots drive the debate, and fix the problems that [give] them their soapbox.\u201d McCain, who has said America-First conservatives make up a mere sliver of the Party, also wrote the faction must be \u201cconfronted before their noxious views spread further and damage for generations the reputation of the Republican Party.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re still a small fraction in the Republican Party. But they\u2019re the ones getting all the attention right now.

Last July, he helped defeat a \u201cskinny\u201d repeal bill 49 to 51 in a dramatic, late-night vote. McCain then went on to vote against the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill in September.

Russia employed the same tactics it has used to influence elections around the world, from France and Germany to Ukraine, Montenegro, and beyond. Putin\u2019s regime launched cyberattacks and spread disinformation with the goal of sowing chaos and weakening faith in our institutions. And while we have no evidence that these efforts affected the outcome of our election, I fear they succeeded in fueling political discord and dividing us from one another. The latest attacks on the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests \u2013 no party\u2019s, no president\u2019s, only Putin\u2019s. The American people deserve to know all of the facts surrounding Russia\u2019s ongoing efforts to subvert our democracy, which is why Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation must proceed unimpeded. Our nation\u2019s elected officials, including the president, must stop looking at this investigation through the warped lens of politics and manufacturing partisan sideshows. If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin\u2019s job for him. The White House and the House Intelligence Committee\u00a0released the FISA memo on Friday. Last December it was revealed that it McCain who passed the Steele dossier to former FBI Director James Comey. McCain met with Andrew Wood in Halifax, Canada at the Halifax Security Forum in Canada in November 2016, and they discussed the dossier. McCain had his associate David Kramer travel to London to meet with Steele and get briefed on the dossier. They arranged to get a hard copy of the dossier to McCain, and he gave it to Comey. The memo describes how senior Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials used the unverified Trump dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant\u00a0on Trump campaign staffer Carter Page. The memo also details how those senior officials in the DOJ and the FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on how the Trump dossier was actually opposition research funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee\u00a0(DNC).",

But a closer look at the situation tells perhaps a different story than McCain\u2019s office or the mainstream media have pushed. The criticism of McCain centers around how the Arizona senator met with Syrian rebel leaders in May 2013 when he visited the country. McCain posed for photographs with those people, and since then rumors have sprouted up across the Internet that he met with ISIS or some other terrorist kidnappers or nefarious forces. \u201cThe people in the pictures with Senator McCain in Syria included General Salim Idris, then-Chief of Staff of the Supreme Military Command of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), Mouaz Moustafa, the Executive Director of the DC-based Syrian Emergency Task Force (which supports the moderate opposition and helped arrange some of the trip), and fighters and commanders from the Northern Storm Brigade, a FSA-aligned group,\u201d McCain\u2019s spokesman Brian Rogers told Breitbart News. Rogers said that the senator and his team aren\u2019t naming the \u201cfighters and commanders from the Northern Storm Brigade, a FSA-aligned group,\u201d because \u201cISIS actually threatened to kill them all, and we don\u2019t want to put their lives at risk.\u201d Rogers provided Breitbart News with a link to the ISIS threat to those fighters. \u201cISIS targeted the Northern Storm because ISIS considers them apostates and because Northern Storm met with Sen. McCain,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cISIS actually wrote out a statement that accused Northern Storm of treachery for reasons including: \u2018Meeting with U.S. Senator John McCain in the hangar and making a contract with him against the Islamists.\u2019 The statement goes on to demand that Northern Storm surrender and repent to ISIS or be killed.\u201d \u201cISIS actually killed many Northern Storm members, and we\u2019re not going to put them at any further risk by naming them,\u201d Rogers added. But there\u2019s just one problem with McCain\u2019s office\u2019s story. Now, McCain\u2019s team says the senator didn\u2019t meet with any bad figures but declines to name them, for what seems to be a legitimate reason\u2013although those who are publicly leading combat against ISIS and against Bashar Al-Assad\u2019s regime are probably publicly known figures there. Just last year, however, McCain\u2019s office had no clue who the senator met. When allegations surfaced that the senator may have met with terrorists who kidnapped someone, Rogers\u2013McCain\u2019s communications director\u2013went on the record to multiple media outlets to say he didn\u2019t know who he was meeting with, and if he did meet with kidnapper terrorists, that would be regrettable. \u201cNone of the individuals the senator planned to meet with was named Mohamad Nour or Abu Ibrahim,\u201d Rogers told CNN in late May 2013, right after the trip. \u201cA number of other Syrian commanders joined the meeting, but none of them identified himself as Mohamad Nour or Abu Ibrahim.\u201d Rogers added later in his statement to CNN that he and the senator did not know who he was meeting with. \u201cA number of the Syrians who greeted Senator McCain upon his arrival in Syria asked to take pictures with him, and, as always, the senator complied,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIf the individual photographed with Senator McCain is in fact Mohamed Nour, that is regrettable. But it would be ludicrous to suggest that the Senator in any way condones the kidnapping of Lebanese Shia pilgrims or has any communication with those responsible. Senator McCain condemns such heinous actions in the strongest possible terms.\u201d Of course it\u2019s ludicrous to suggest that McCain would condone the act of kidnapping, and nobody serious is suggesting that. The point many critics of McCain\u2019s policies\u2013including Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)\u2013are making is that Americans have no way of knowing which team any one of these figures is on. \u201cHere\u2019s the problem,\u201d Paul said in an interview with The Daily Beast this week. \u201cHe [McCain] did meet with ISIS, and had his picture taken, and didn\u2019t know it was happening at the time. That really shows you the quandary of determining who are the moderates and who aren\u2019t. If you don\u2019t speak Arabic, and you don\u2019t understand that some people will lie to you\u2013I really think that we don\u2019t have a good handle on who are the moderates and who aren\u2019t, and I think the objective evidence is that the ones doing most of the fighting and most of the battles among the rebels in Syria are the radical Islamists.\u201d Paul has been roundly criticized for the remarks, starting with the publication he made them to. The Daily Beast\u2019s Olivia Nuzzi wrote that Paul\u2019s statement means he \u201crepeated a thoroughly debunked rumor.\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker Glenn Kessler gave Paul \u201cFour Pinocchios,\u201d its highest rating of dishonesty, for the statement. Kessler wrote that this story is one where he regrets \u201cwe are limited to just Four Pinocchios,\u201d because there is \u201czero evidence that any of the men that McCain met with in Syria are linked to the Islamic State.\u201d Despite this pile-on by the media and political establishment, Paul has a serious point here, though. McCain really didn\u2019t know who he was meeting with, and even if they were the supposedly \u201cmoderate\u201d Free Syrian Army, who\u2019s to know that they aren\u2019t elements of the Free Syrian Army working alongside ISIS? Patrick Poole, an esteemed national security reporter and expert on radical Islam for PJ Media, has reported that the Free Syrian Army\u2019s commanders have admitted in public to working alongside ISIS. \u201cAs President Obama laid out his \u2018strategy\u2019 last night for dealing with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and as bipartisan leadership in Congress pushes to approve as much as $4 billion to arm Syrian \u2018rebels,\u2019 it should be noted that the keystone to his anti-Assad policy \u2014 the \u2018vetted moderate\u2019 Free Syrian Army (FSA) \u2014 is now admitting that they, too, are working with the Islamic State,\u201d Poole wrote on Sept. 10. Poole cites the Lebanese newspaper Daily Star, which quotes a Free Syrian Army brigade commander as saying he is working with the \u201cIslamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda\u2019s official Syrian affiliate \u2014 both U.S.-designated terrorist organizations.\u201d Specifically, the quotes Poole pulls are: \u201cWe are collaborating with the Islamic State and the Nusra Front by attacking the Syrian Army\u2019s gatherings in\u2026 Qalamoun,\u201d said Bassel Idriss, the commander of an FSA-aligned rebel brigade. \u201cWe have reached a point where we have to collaborate with anyone against unfairness and injustice,\u201d confirmed Abu Khaled, another FSA commander who lives in Arsal. \u201cLet\u2019s face it: The Nusra Front is the biggest power present right now in Qalamoun and we as FSA would collaborate on any mission they launch as long as it coincides with our values,\u201d he added. In a lengthy floor speech on Thursday, Paul ripped the foreign policy establishment in Washington for assuming that FSA and ISIS are really distinct entities. \u201cAccording to a New York Times report, over a year ago, the CIA began training Syrian rebels in nearby Jordan, thousands of them, along with delivering arms and ammunition,\u201d Paul said, according to a transcript of the speech provided to Breitbart News by his office. \u201cNew York Times reports also detailed the huge arms and financial transfers from Quatar to the Syrian rebels, beginning as early as 2011. No one really knows where that all ended up: Jane\u2019s Terrorism Center noted, the transfer of Quatari arms to targeted groups has the same practical effect as shipping them to Al Nusra, a violent jihadist force. The New York Times further detailed that Sudan has provided anti-tank missiles and other arms.\u201d Shortly after those comments, Paul said that America can\u2019t be sure\u2013since supposedly \u201cvetted moderates\u201d are working alongside ISIS\u2013who any of them are. He added that even if some might be loyal now, they could change their allegiances in a heartbeat\u2013saying that some officials estimate that more than half of FSA forces have defected to ISIS. \u201cSo the idea that these rebels haven\u2019t been armed before is ludicrous on it\u2019s face. It is also ludicrous to believe that we know where all of the money, arms and ammunition will end up, or who will end up benefiting from these shipments. Why? Because we don\u2019t know for sure who the groups all are,\u201d Paul said. \u201cEven when we think we do, loyalties shift and groups become amorphous, with alleged moderates lining up with jihadists. And finally, moderate groups have often sold their weapons or had them seized by the jihadist elements led by ISIS.\u201d McCain\u2019s office, however, fiercely defends the notion that FSA is not working alongside ISIS. \u201cAlso, these reports of some kind of \u2018truce\u2019 between the FSA and ISIS have also been debunked,\u201d Rogers, McCain\u2019s spokesman, told Breitbart News\u2013citing a piece from the Daily Beast to back up his claims. \u201cWhile there have been brief cease-fires between the groups to collect bodies of those killed during fighting, as this Josh Rogin article makes clear, there\u2019s no \u2018truce\u2019 between FSA and ISIS.\u201d And maybe there is no formal \u201ctruce\u201d between FSA and ISIS, but the reports of mass defections and quotes from FSA leaders and brigade commanders on record saying they are working with ISIS makes this much more complicated than the clear cut-and-dry issue the mainstream media have made it so as to rip Paul. When McCain\u2019s office won\u2019t name who exactly he met with, who exactly he\u2019s photographed with\u2013after last year admitting in public they didn\u2019t know who he greeted in Syria\u2013are we supposed to just take his word for it that\u00a0some of those FSA leaders aren\u2019t now working with ISIS\u2013or maybe have outright joined ISIS, like that other FSA commander Poole and the\u00a0Daily Star quote?

      "author": "Kristina Wong",
      "content": " \u201cWhen brought to senior Navy leaders\u2019 attention, direct guidance was given to keep the ships in normal configurations,\u201d a Navy official said. The Wall Street Journal first reported that the White House Military Office had asked that the ship be hidden during Trump\u2019s visit and that a tarp and a barge were placed to obscure the ship\u2019s name. The story sparked outrage from Trump\u2019s critics, including from the late senator\u2019s daughter, that the president would make such a request. Shortly after, Trump said he was not informed about \u201canything\u201d having to do with the McCain. The Navy also put out a statement stating that the McCain was not obscured during Trump\u2019s visit to Yokosuka: The name of USS John S. McCain was not obscured during the POTUS visit to Yokosuka on Memorial Day. The Navy is proud of that ship, its crew, its namesake and its heritage. \u2014 Navy Chief of Information (@chinfo) May 30, 2019  The WSJ report also said that Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan was \u201caware of the concern about the presence of the USS John McCain in Japan and approved measures to ensure it didn\u2019t interfere with the president\u2019s visit.\u201d Hours later, Army Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, said in a statement, \u201cSecretary Shanahan was not aware of the directive to move the USS John S McCain nor was he aware of the concern precipitating the directive.\u201d CNBC published alleged email correspondence by a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command official reflecting a conversation between the White House Military Office and the Navy\u2019s 7th Fleet in advance of the president\u2019s trip. It said, \u201cUSS John McCain needs to be out of sight.\u201d A Navy spokesman for 7th Fleet, Cmdr. Clayton Doss, later said in a statement, \u201cAll ships remained in their normal configuration during the President\u2019s visit.\u201d Two Navy officials, speaking to Breitbart News on background on Thursday, denied that the tarp or the barge was related to the alleged White House Military Office request. The officials said a white tarp was put on the McCain\u2018s stern from late Friday, May 24, to Saturday morning, May 25, as part of \u201cpreservation and maintenance.\u201d During that time, a\u00a0photo was taken of the ship covered by a tarp, one official said. That photo ran along with the WSJ story. The official said the tarp was only there temporarily and that when the commander of the ship, Navy Cmdr. Micah Murphy, left on Friday there was no tarp, and when he arrived back to the ship on Saturday morning it was gone. The officials did not say exactly who put the tarp up or took it down, but suggested it was part of ongoing maintenance on the ship. The McCain has been under repair since it collided with another ship in August 2017. The Navy officials also denied that a paint barge was used to cover up the ship\u2019s name. The second official said the McCain was being painted ahead of Trump\u2019s visit and the paint barge was moved away on Sunday, May 26. Trump did not arrive until Monday, May 27. \u201cThe ship wasn\u2019t moved nor was anything put in place that would obstruct the name,\u201d the first official said. \u201cThe 7th Fleet wouldn\u2019t accept anything that would obscure the name of the ship on the day of the visit.\u201d \u201cThe paint barge comes and goes,\u201d the second official said. \u201cIt was there to paint and do hull preservation and then it was gone.\u201d The official added that it is very common for ships to be painted ahead of high-level visits like the president\u2019s. \u201cA lot of the other ships did that very same thing. I know the Wasp did. I know they were out there painting, and sweeping and getting ready,\u201d the official said. The first official added it would have been difficult for Trump to even see the name of the McCain, due to the way the ships are lined up. The WSJ also reported that the McCain\u2018s sailors were given the day off during the visit. A Washington Post report said the crew was released from duty for the long holiday weekend, along with sailors from another ship, the USS Stethem. The second Navy official said the McCain and Stethem sailors did not participate in the president\u2019s visit because they were not among commands selected. Those selected included both afloat and ashore units, and were \u201cbroad representation,\u201d the official said. The official confirmed that the McCain sailors were on a 96-hour Memorial Day weekend liberty, which concluded Tuesday after the visit. The official also batted down reports that had the McCain sailors participated in the event, they would have worn hats with \u201cMcCain\u201d on them. \u201cParticipating commands were directed to wear 8-point covers (hats) and Type IIIs for uniformity the day of POTUS\u2019 visit,\u201d the official said, referring to sailors\u2019 green utility uniform and hat. The official said sailors would have not been wearing their ball caps with ship names on them. \u201cIf anyone was turned away, it was because they were not in the right uniform,\u201d the official said. Trump again told reporters Thursday morning that he did not have anything to do with the White House Military Office request. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I wasn\u2019t involved. I would not have done that. I was very angry with John McCain because he killed health care. I was not a big fan of John McCain in any way shape or form,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a fan but I would never do a thing like that. Now somebody did it because they thought I didn\u2019t like him, OK? And they were well-meaning, I will say, I didn\u2019t know anything about it.

The comments are the harshest yet from the GOP side of the aisle and come as some Democrats are openly calling for President Donald Trump impeachment over the \u201cComey Memo.\u201d Rep. Al Green (D-TX) did so on the House floor Tuesday morning. McCain\u2019s comments add to rumblings among certain other Republicans on Capitol Hill who have signaled their willingness to abandon Trump over the allegations in Comey\u2019s memo and reports of discussion of classified information with Russian diplomats. The Hill reported Wednesday that the Comey Memo was causing more GOPers to try and detach their legislative agenda from the president. McCain has been a proponent of the Russian election-influence narrative, and a central figure in Senate hearings on the issue. He expressed his dismay\u00a0over President Trump\u2019s decision to dismiss Comey last week. The six-term senator and 2008 GOP nominee for president has been a pillar of anti-Trump Republicans since shortly after Trump\u2019s announcement in 2015 when the two became embroiled in a controversy over Trump\u2019s comment on McCain\u2019s time as a Vietnam POW. \u201cNever Trump\u201d commentator Bill Kristol even called for McCain to intervene as an independent candidate on the eve of the 2016 Republican National Convention. McCain\u2019s opposition to Russia\u2019s foreign policy ambitions, dating back to the Cold War era, has played a central role in his political career. In his 2008 bid for the presidency, McCain famously wrote that \u201cwe are all Georgians\u201d in advocating a stronger American response to the contemporaneous Russian military intervention in the small Caucasian state. He similarly called for the United States to provide military aid to Ukraine in 2014. Although he stopped well short of calling for impeachment or resignation, the ultimate fate of President Richard Nixon in the 1970s scandal he referenced, McCain\u2019s appraisal of the situation fits neatly into an emerging mainstream media narrative that Trump\u2019s actions rise to an equivalent level.",

      "content": " According to the far-left Axios, \u201cExamples from organizers include opening a dialogue with a competitor, committing to working with a colleague or peer with a different perspective and calling a family member you disagree with \u2014 and pledging to listen.\u201d A spokesman for the McCain Institute told the Hill, \u201cMy family and I are going out of our way to properly meet our (not so) new neighbors, who on the face of it we have little in common with.\u201d This is the dumbest thing ever, not to mention wildly hypocritical. Do we really need a lecture about civility from John McCain\u2019s widow, Cindy, who racially profiled a family, accused them of being human traffickers, and then lied and said they were guilty, all to self-aggrandize? Do we really need a lecture about civility from The Great White View Screecher? Do we really need a lecture about civility from a family that is so small and bitter they turned a national funeral into a disgusting and divisive campaign rally against the sitting U.S. president and his supporters? And this is just typical of the McCains, to pervert a virtue, in this case \u201ccivility,\u201d into an ego trip, into an effort to feel superior to us slobs, to get on TV, to speak down to everyone else because they are just so above it all. John McCain perfected this, the art of weaponizing virtues. His cynical ability to twist words like \u201chonor\u201d into an imperious spear that would win him and his insatiable ego a positive mention in the left-wing media was always his go-to move. And look at what most of this lame campaign centers on: imposing ourselves on others to make ourselves feel better about ourselves. How about just leaving these people the hell alone? We\u2019re supposed to honor the anniversary of McCain\u2019s death by being a pain in someone\u2019s ass? Where is the virtue in imposing yourself on others just to make yourself feel good? And why does it always work this way with establishment Republicans who adore the establishment media\u2026? Have you noticed that? Their idea of virtue, of nobility, is always a peacocking act of public surrender. How about if we honor John McCain with a day where we agree to stick by our principles, hold tight to our beliefs and what we believe is right, no matter how much pressure is brought down on us, no matter how many friends we lose, no matter how angry the fake news media get\u2026? How about a day like that? You know, like repealing Obamacare\u2026 Oh, wait:  Or a day where we agree to stop grinding axes, holding grudges, and move on for the good for the country\u2026? Oh, wait:  Or a day where we don\u2019t snub those who have been unfailingly loyal, just to appease the elite. Oh, wait. Or a day where we pledge not to allow our envy and jealousy to push us to a point where we spread vicious lies about each other\u2026? Oh, wait. Or a day where we don\u2019t leak smears about black men who dare to have minds of their own\u2026? Oh, wait. The horrible McCain family needs to sit down. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Leaked emails between the White House Military Office and the Navy Seventh Fleet showed the White House working to make sure that the ship did not interfere with the president\u2019s visit, according to the Wall Street Journal.

But a spokesperson for the U.S. Pacific Fleet told NBC News\u00a0that the photo in the Wall Street Journal article was from Friday and the tarp was taken down on Saturday.\u00a0The President visited the troops on Monday. The ship is currently under repair after crashing into a merchant ship in 2017, killing 10 sailors. The Navy also clarified the report on Twitter.  McCain\u2019s daughter Meghan voiced her criticism of the president on Twitter. \u201cTrump is a child who will always be deeply threatened by the greatness of my dad\u2019s incredible life. There is a lot of criticism of how much I speak about my dad, but nine months since he passed, Trump won\u2019t let him RIP.

      "author": "John Hayward",
      "content": " Sworn Donald Trump enemy John McCain admitted Wednesday that he passed the dossier of claims of a Russian blackmail plot against the president-elect. The Arizona senator issued a public statement amid mounting questions of his exact role in the affair \u2013 and how a document riddled with errors and unverifiable claims came to be published. \u2018Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public,\u2019 he said. \u2018Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI. \u2018That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.\u2019 But the Daily Mail \u2013 which, it should be noted, seems to like McCain about as much as McCain likes Trump \u2013 argues that the \u201c2008 Republican loser\u201d might have been \u201cfar more intimately involved than that.\u201d Watergate legend Carl Bernstein is quoted telling CNN that McCain got the dossier from the former British ambassador to Moscow, who in turn got it from that mysterious \u201cformer British MI6 agent who was hired from a political opposition research firm in Washington\u201d that we\u2019ve been hearing so much about lately. Isn\u2019t this precisely the kind of political influence operation our media spent the past few weeks freaking out about, when they thought Russia ran one against Hillary Clinton? It\u2019s also a perfect example of what the establishment media really means when it complains about \u201cfake news.\u201d They\u2019re very protective of their ability to shut down stories. They hate it when people who aren\u2019t credentialed journalists use the Internet and talk radio to generate interest in something the media earlier deemed a non-story. If that interest grows intense enough, establishment media can find itself dragged back into covering something it didn\u2019t want to cover. That\u2019s what happened here: against its political interests, the establishment media didn\u2019t think this bundle of opposition research was solid enough to merit coverage, but now it\u2019s been pushed into the spotlight and they\u2019re all talking about it. The new White House Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, denigrated the source of what he called \u201cphony-baloney garbage\u201d perfectly on Wednesday morning: \u201cI\u2019ve read most of it. But what I can tell you is that even the New York Times last night refused to publish this document, which is not an intelligence document. Keep in mind, this is some retired guy somewhere out in the world acting like Ian Fleming, apparently trying to maybe write a fiction novel.\u201d On Wednesday morning, we learned that a key figure in the dirty dossier, Trump counsel Michael Cohen, has produced convincing documentary evidence that he did not travel to Prague to meet with Kremlin officials, as the anti-Trump oppo dump alleges. We\u2019re now told that it was some other Michael Cohen in Prague. It\u2019s all starting to sound like a script written by the Coen Brothers. Also on Wednesday, NBC News revealed that the dossier, which contains \u201cobvious errors,\u201d was not actually presented to Trump by the intelligence community, as early reporting breathlessly asserted. Instead, Trump was given an oral briefing based on a two-page summary\u2026 as an example of what \u201cdisinformation\u201d looks like. \u201cIntel and law enforcement officials agree that none of the investigations have found any conclusive or direct link between Trump and the Russian government period,\u201d the senior official said. According to the official, the two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material made available to the briefers was to provide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted \u201cdisinformation.\u201d The briefers also had available to them unvetted \u201cdisinformation\u201d about the Clinton Foundation, although that was not shared with Trump. (Emphasis mine, but NBC really should have emphasized it, or made it the lede for their story.) But Buzzfeed threw the full contents of that dossier out the public and said, Top media organizations and intelligence agencies couldn\u2019t verify any of this stuff after months of hard work, but you folks can decide for yourselves! No doubt local Rotary clubs are putting together top-shelf intelligence bureaus and developing contacts in Moscow at this very moment. In his press conference on Wednesday morning, Trump thanked news organizations which refused to publish the salacious material when it was shopped to them during the campaign. \u201cI do have to say that, and I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies, who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies, which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that, a tremendous blot. Because a thing like that should have never been written, and it should certainly never have been released,\u201d he said. Senator McCain has absolutely no excuse for pushing this tripe to the FBI. He\u2019s a senior senator with intelligence experience. He knew the sources for the most explosive \u201crevelations\u201d were extremely dodgy. He has always been\u00a0very chummy with the press, so he would have known they didn\u2019t think this material was solid enough to even allude to it during the election, no matter how badly they wanted Hillary Clinton to win \u2013 not even when they believed the FBI investigation of Clinton was severely damaging her image. To borrow a phrase from President-elect Trump, there are plenty of tremendous blots to go around today.",

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": "  Transcript is as follows: And I say this with the deepest of sincerity \u2013 and I don\u2019t want calls on this, by the way: Am I the only person in America who thinks the passing of McCain and the news coverage has gone on a little too long and it\u2019s a little too much? Really, you can honor somebody, but this is going on day after day after day after day after day. And I don\u2019t say this out of any animus whatsoever, period. Why do some public officials get this kind of treatment \u2013 Kennedy, McCain, so forth \u2013 and others get no treatment whatsoever. You\u2019ve probably never even heard of them, probably weren\u2019t on TV as much as say McCain or Lindsey Graham and so forth. To me the heroic part of John McCain has nothing to do with his service in the Senate and everything to do with his service in the United States military, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s a hero to the American people \u2013 what he did in the United States military and what was done to him, and his bravery. And we have a gentleman \u2013 I just told you \u2013 he\u2019s still a member of the House of Representatives, by the name of Sam Johnson. Outside of Dallas, Texas, the vast majority of the American people have never heard of him. I have had him on the program in the past. And he won\u2019t get a send away like this. So, why? And again, I don\u2019t want calls on this. Is it because of his votes against Republicans, whether it was on immigration or Obamacare or tax cuts under Bush or things of that sort? I\u2019m quite serious about this. In the election of 2008, most of the same voices we\u2019re hearing today in the media and in the Democratic Party condemned McCain. Some even accused him of being racist \u2013 surprise, surprise, that\u2019s what they do \u2013 and strongly supported Obama and pushed Obama. You had nasty editorials written about McCain. They would talk about his temper. They would talk about potential\u2014they just went on and on and on. You and I, we\u2019re the ones that voted for McCain, and we lost badly. The main reason is we wanted to stop Obama. But is it because McCain didn\u2019t have fidelity to conservatism or Republicanism, or what is it? It\u2019s incredible. We had this, for two days, these attacks on the president for being cheap, for being low, for being worse, because of the flag not being at half-mast throughout the mourning period. The mourning period, I think, goes through Sunday. Okay, fine. I understand that \u2013 that is, the criticism. But you don\u2019t see the same kind of criticism applied to John McCain or the people who planned his goodbye in slighting Sarah Palin, which really is a mean thing to do. She never said a nasty word about John McCain, even when conservatives were raising questions about what he did and so forth. She never did. When I had her on a couple months ago, on Life, Liberty & Levin, wouldn\u2019t say a negative thing about him. Never did. She was his vice presidential running mate. He picked her. That seems to be a little bit more relevant to me than the flag flying at half-mast through Sunday, and yet you\u2019ll see almost no criticism of this by the same so-called news outlets, the same so-called voices , you know, the same crowd who can\u2019t wait to attack Trump. But I\u2019m just saying, it seems a little over the top to me, what\u2019s going on, and they\u2019re not done. Today is Thursday, right, Rich? So, we got Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So that\u2019s really a full week. And I want to make abundantly clear\u2014I want to say it again, because people like to twist my words and try to destroy our program\u2014this has nothing to do with animus. It\u2019s an observation. Was it because he was a presidential candidate? Is that what Mitt Romney will get? I don\u2019t know. But I suspect the media attention is more a result of him breaking with orthodox conservatism or traditional conservatism at key points, at which he was very, very helpful to the Democrat Party and the left, which, of course, we know the media embrace. Just one man\u2019s observation. [HT\u00a0CNS/Michael Morris]",

      "author": "Tony Lee",
      "content": " \u201cRight now, Republicans are on the wrong side of that progress,\u201d McCain reportedly writes in his new book, Restless Wave, according to a Wednesday report in the Guardian. \u201cAnd if we want to retain our competitiveness in the fastest-growing communities in the country we\u2019ll stop letting the zealots drive the debate, and fix the problems that [give] them their soapbox.\u201d McCain also urges Republicans to reject those who think America is being \u201ccontaminated by the customs of non-European immigrants.\u201d With the help of his establishment collaborator Mark Salter, McCain repeats the same GOP establishment talking points about how Republicans cannot win elections, minorities, and swing voters without supporting amnesty for nearly all illegal immigrants in a comprehensive immigration package. After the 2012 election, the Republican National Committee produced its infamous and incompetent \u201cautopsy\u201d report in which the only policy solution was amnesty for illegal immigrants. In 2016, though, Trump made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his economic nationalist campaign. Trump not only won the presidency, but he did so while getting more support among people of color than establishment darling Willard \u201cMitt\u201d Romney received four years before. McCain also claimed that America-first Republicans only make up a \u201csmall fraction in the Republican Party.\u201d Perhaps McCain was confusing establishment Republicans in the permanent political class with actual voters that they have shown to have absolutely nothing but contempt and disdain for, especially when it comes to immigration and strong borders. \u201cThey\u2019re still a small fraction in the Republican Party. But they\u2019re the ones getting all the attention right now. They need to be confronted, not ignored or winked at or quietly dismissed as kooks,\u201d McCain writes. \u201cThey need to be confronted before their noxious views spread further and damage for generations the reputation of the Republican Party.\u201d As Breitbart\u2019s John Binder has noted, polling has shown that immigration is one of the most important issue for GOP primary voters, a vast majority of whom also want to also cut legal immigration. Immigration has always been one of the most powerful issues for the GOP base. McCain found that out during his 2008 presidential run when his primary campaign nearly went bankrupt after he teamed up with the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) to push comprehensive amnesty legislation, which then-President George W. Bush also backed. At one point, McCain had to carry his own bags and fly in coach class to New Hampshire. His campaign\u2019s dire financial situation ultimately resulted in McCain being burdened with incompetent advisers who were in over their heads\u2014like Nicolle Wallace and Steve Schmidt\u2014managing his campaign, which was unable to rebut the barrage of ads the Obama campaign unleashed on McCain in key swing states like Virginia. McCain, though, has been insistent that Congress try again to pass a \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty bill, telling the Arizona Republic last year it is one of the main issues he would like to see resolved.",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " McCain was born on a U.S. Navy base in Panama in 1936, the son and grandson of career Navy officers. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and served as a Navy pilot in the Vietnam War. He was shot down over Hanoi in 1967\u00a0and was\u00a0a prisoner of war for five and a half years. McCain was tortured by the North Vietnamese, leaving him permanently disabled. He famously refused to be released ahead of POWs\u00a0who had been captured first \u2014 denying the enemy\u00a0a propaganda coup, since his father was then the commander of all U.S. forces in Vietnam. Upon his release in 1973, McCain studied at the Naval War College in Washington, DC, where he puzzled over the question of America\u2019s struggles in Vietnam, ultimately concluding that lack of political commitment to victory had led to defeat. It was a lesson that would guide his later approach, in Congress, to America\u2019s foreign interventions. McCain was assigned to be\u00a0the Navy\u2019s liaison to the Senate in 1977, which served as his introduction to politics. He retired in 1981 and ran for Congress in Arizona\u2019s first congressional district in 1982, and won. He opposed U.S. intervention in Lebanon, defying\u00a0President Ronald Reagan, warning that there was no\u00a0clear strategy for victory. He was proved correct, tragically, when a terrorist\u00a0drove a truck bomb into the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut later that year, killing hundreds of American and French peacekeeping troops and leading to an American withdrawal. In 1986, McCain won his first term in the U.S. Senate. He soon found himself embroiled in scandal as one of the Keating Five, accused of intervening in a federal investigation of the Lincoln Savings and Loan, run by McCain donor Charles H. Keating, Jr. McCain\u00a0was cleared of any wrongdoing beyond poor judgment, but the experience had\u00a0scarred him deeply, and he committed the rest of his Senate career to fighting against corruption and waste. McCain soon developed a reputation as a \u201cmaverick,\u201d defying his party whenever he thought it was veering too far to the right (or, critics said, whenever it suited his own\u00a0ambitions). In 2000, McCain ran for President, mounting a strong primary campaign against Texas governor George W. Bush and winning New Hampshire, where his brand of centrist politics found traction. He lost\u00a0a bitter South Carolina primary race, however, and soon ran out of steam. In the Senate, McCain continued to build a profile as a reformer.\u00a0His major achievement was the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law, officially known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), which passed in 2002. Many Republicans were deeply critical of BCRA, which they saw as a form of unilateral disarmament and a limit on free speech. Parts of the law were ruled\u00a0unconstitutional in the controversial\u00a0Citizens United case in 2010. McCain also joined\u00a0the \u201cGang of 14,\u201d a bipartisan group of Senators that fought to preserve the filibuster after the Republicans threatened to end it\u00a0in response to\u00a0Democrats repeatedly blocking\u00a0President Bush\u2019s judicial nominees. And McCain continued to work with Democrats, notably Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), in proposing\u00a0immigration reform bills that were backed by the administration but ultimately\u00a0collapsed due to opposition\u00a0within both parties. In 2003, McCain joined a bipartisan majority in the Senate in supporting the Iraq War. But unlike many others, who abandoned the war as a terrorist insurgency grew, McCain remained committed to victory. Drawing from his ideas on Vietnam, he argued that the U.S. needed additional troops to secure Iraqi cities, defeat local Al-Qaeda cells, and prevent new terrorists from infiltrating. As the war grew more unpopular, he was virtually alone in his position. However, President George W. Bush agreed with him, and launched the \u201csurge\u201d in 2007, in defiance of the opinions of the top military brass and the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan panel that recommended reducing U.S. commitment to the war. McCain put aside his old rivalry with Bush and became the best surrogate for the White House\u2019s policy. In 2007, McCain launched a second presidential campaign. He was seen as a long-shot candidate, especially after his campaign lost several key staff members in mid-2007. But his steadfast commitment to the surge helped him to stand out among the other candidates on the debate stage, and voters were\u00a0moved\u00a0by the force of his convictions. In addition, it was clear that the electorate was ready for change, and McCain made the case that he alone among Republicans had a record of fighting for reforms. He won New Hampshire again, and eventually the nomination. In the general election, McCain faced\u00a0then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL), who had\u00a0just won a spectacular, if brutal, victory over then-Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) in the Democratic primary. McCain made the controversial\u00a0decision not to attack Obama for his deep ties to the racist Chicago preacher Jeremiah Wright \u2014 perhaps out of a sense of guilt for his own early opposition to naming a pubic holiday for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., which he regretted. McCain trailed Obama for most of the summer of 2008. But\u00a0he bested Obama at a religious forum hosted by pastor Rick Warren, and then upended the entire race by naming Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, the first time a woman had been named to a Republican presidential ticket. Palin, a corruption-busting fellow \u201cmaverick,\u201d captured the public imagination and briefly attracted the interest of women voters disappointed by Clinton\u2019s loss. But the McCain-Palin lead was short-lived. The media targeted Palin with hostile, even condescending, coverage. And then, in mid-September, the global financial crisis struck as Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers collapsed. Obama, who had criticized the Bush administration\u2019s economic performance for months, seemed prescient. McCain decided to show leadership by suspending his campaign and returning to Washington, DC, where he\u00a0backed a $700 billion bailout\u00a0in the form of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), which was decried by conservatives and liberals alike. Obama, too, voted for TARP, but by the time they arrived at the first presidential debate a few days later, there was no longer any real difference between the candidates. Obama\u00a0went on to win the election easily. Conventional wisdom in party establishment circles partly blamed Palin for McCain\u2019s loss, but she helped turn out the conservative vote in areas where the moderate McCain had struggled to connect. Recently, McCain said that he regretted choosing Palin instead of Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a fellow foreign policy hawk and the man who nearly became vice president on the Democratic ticket with Al Gore in 2000. Back in the Senate, McCain remained deeply critical of Obama\u2019s foreign policies, as the new administration backed away from the country\u2019s previous commitments to Iraq, creating a vacuum for the Iranian regime and new terrorist groups like the so-called Islamic State. But McCain remained a maverick, and joined the bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight\u201d in proposing a new immigration reform bill \u2014 despite having run for re-election in 2010 on a promise to \u201cbuild the danged fence\u201d along the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill ultimately died due to conservative opposition in the House. In 2015, McCain was deeply critical of\u00a0Donald Trump, who had entered the race for president on a platform of strong opposition to illegal immigration. In response, Trump aimed a pointed insult at McCain\u2019s war record: \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d That ignited a feud that never ended. McCain\u2019s decisive, dramatic \u201cthumbs-down\u201d vote to defeat an effort to repeal Obamacare in July 2017 was widely perceived\u00a0as motivated by personal revenge. McCain announced that he had brain cancer last July, but continued to work in the Senate as he received treatment. His condition worsened in recent months, and he returned to Arizona to convalesce at home, surrounded by friends and family. His family announced on Aug. 24 that he was ending medical treatment. He is survived by his wife, Cindy McCain (n\u00e9e Hensley), his first wife,\u00a0Carol Shepp McCain; seven children, many grandchildren, and his redoubtable mother, Roberta, still alive at the ripe old age of 106. Associates of the ailing Senator made it clear in the closing days of his life that he did not want President Trump to attend his funeral. John McCain will be remembered for many things \u2014 his heroic endurance in Vietnam, his passion for reform, his battles with his own party, and his\u00a0support for the military. But perhaps the most memorable\u00a0tribute came from the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, who wrote after McCain\u2019s tough loss in the 2008 election: \u201cHe will be \u2014 he should be \u2014 remembered as the most worthy presidential nominee ever to be denied the prize.\u201d Joel B.

      "content": " Earlier Thursday, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued a press release stating she will be the latest Democrat to join the effort to block Gorsuch from receiving a vote on the Senate Floor. By Breitbart\u2019s count, the majority of the Senate Democratic Caucus have now pledged their support for a filibuster, called for initially by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). At most, twelve remain undecided. An NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll released Thursday put the American public at 54% for giving Gorsuch an up-or-down vote, while 37% are opposed. A growing number of Republican senators, in light the increasing indication Democrats will reach the fourty-one votes needed for a successful filibuster, have expressed their willingness to invoke the \u201cConstitutional Option\u201d and extend the Democrats\u2019 elimination of filibusters to Supreme Court nominees once and for all. McCain, one of the longest-serving Republicans in the Senate, is attempting to reach some kind of deal to put Gorsuch on the Supreme Court and yet save the traditional sixty-vote cloture rule. For any such deal, he would need six additional Democrats to join the upper chamber\u2019s fifty-two Republicans and two Democrats, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), who each issued statements Thursday indicating they would support Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation. \u201cThere\u2019s always hope, because maybe we\u2019ll recognize the damage that\u2019s been done to the institution and the American people,\u201d McCain told Bloomberg Politics. \u201cI\u2019ll have conversations, but I\u2019m not optimistic.\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) engaged in negotiations across the aisle of his own. \u201cWhile he has been urging Democratic colleagues not to filibuster, he has been clear that he will do whatever is necessary to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court,\u201d his spokesman Jason Samuels told Breitbart. Neither Flake nor McCain expressed a great deal of hope the looming showdown between the two rapidly entrenching blocs over the future of Senate rules could be averted before the vote on Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, now set for April 7.",

PHILIP RUCKER: Well, I\u2019ll see if I can do that, Nicole. I mean, Trump has been nursing a grudge about John McCain for more than three years now. Go all the way back to the first big controversy\u00a0of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in August of 2015 in Iowa, where Trump made a really flippant remark about McCain saying \u201cI like heroes who weren\u2019t captured\u201d and he got tremendous heat and blowback on that, including from the Republican National Committee and throughout the party establishment, and Trump, instead of apologizing to McCain and commending his war service, just dug in. Every since then, McCain has been sort of a ghost in Trump\u2019s mind, somebody he can\u2019t shake. He was really bothered by that healthcare vote, obviously, but it\u2019s been other things. \u2026 RON KLAIN: I think there\u2019s a personal element and a political element. On the personal side, you know, Meghan McCain says that Donald Trump is not a great man. I would say what we saw this weekend shows that Donald Trump is barely human. I mean, to go after and attack John McCain, a national hero, months after his death, is just, it\u2019s subhuman. It\u2019s not only not befitting a president, it\u2019s not befitting basic common norms of decency, that\u2019s the human aspect of it. From a political aspect, if Donald Trump really wants to relitigate the vote on Obamacare over and over again, my party won a national election in 2018 when the issue was health care, when the issue was whether or not Donald Trump was going to take away people\u2019s coverage for pre-existing condition. Every time Donald Trump wants to sit in the Oval Office and say, \u201cI wish I\u2019d taken away people\u2019s coverage for pre-existing conditions,\u201d that\u2019s a videotape my party would love to see on T.V. every day of the week.",

      "content": " Let me put it this way, had social media banned me 10 years ago, I would have been mortified. If social media bans me today, I\u2019ll hardly miss it. If social media bans me in five years, why would an old guy counting the seconds to retirement, to the moment he can drive a \u00a0pickup truck over his iPhone, give even half a damn? So it is with more amusement than concern that I watch as fascist social media corporations, the Democrat Party, and most especially the corporate media go the full-Orwell when it comes to throughtcrimes. My use of Orwell\u2019s \u201cthoughtcrime\u201d is not for affect or hyperbole. Without question, there is a serious, organized, and intense campaign at work here, a campaign backed by billions of corporate dollars, to abuse the public into believing things that are simply not true. And the punishment for committing the crime of holding \u201cunacceptable\u201d thoughts and/or ideas is real: public shaming, bullying, banishment from the public square (social media), and economic sanctions \u2014 job losses, advertising boycotts, etc. Here are three of the most absurd thoughtcrimes: Gender is Fluid No, not it\u2019s not. Biologically, gender is imprinted on every strand of your DNA and is more pronounced than skin color. That is scientific fact. But this is how absurd things have become: if I ran around pretending to be a black woman, even though I have more science on my side to back up my claim of being black, the anti-science fascists would condemn my cultural appropriation while celebrating my gender dysphoria. It\u2019s pure madness, and it goes like this\u2026 Caitlyn Jenner is a woman. No, he\u2019s not. She is because she says she is. Science, biology, and his schlong says he\u2019s not. You\u2019re a bigot. Because I don\u2019t want mentally ill men allowed in public restrooms with young girls? How dare you call her mentally ill. It is what it is. So androgynous rock stars are mentally ill \u2014 David Bowie and Annie Lennox? Gender non-conformity is not the same as gender dysphoria. One is rebellion, self expression. The other is something tragic. People should be allowed to live their lives in whatever way they choose. That\u2019s rich coming from a pronoun Nazi. You\u2019re a monster. Trans people deserve our compassion and support. Agreed. My uncle identified as a TV antennae. We didn\u2019t patronize him. We got him help. We could have exploited him. Put him in the circus or on the roof. But because we care about him, he got treatment. You\u2019re exploiting people in desperate need of psychological help for political reasons. That makes you the monster. Call Caitlyn a \u201cshe\u201d and believe it or you\u2019re blacklisted. Oh, and these trans folks are going to destroy women\u2019s sports. They\u2019re women because they say they\u2019re women. Call me Napoleon. Obese Swimsuit Models are Beautiful No, no they\u2019re not. They\u2019re the opposite of attractive. Sure, some people find naked obese women (and men) attractive, but that\u2019s what we call a fetish. Today, however, we are being ordered to find a 300 pound woman in a string bikini sexy \u2014 or at least to pretend we do convincingly enough to avoid punishment. Hey, I\u2019m not trying to be an asshole about this; no one wants to see me in a speedo, but I\u2019m not the fascist who\u2019s bullying everyone into pretending otherwise. And it goes like this\u2026 Naked, fat women are beautiful. Do you believe in evolution? Of course I do. Scientifically it makes no sense for our species to find obese women attractive, which is why we don\u2019t. It is a biological fact that men are hard-wired to look for healthy mates as a means to propagate the species, which is why \u2014 \u00a0whether it is someone who\u2019s ill, someone very old, or an obese someone \u2014 unhealthy people are unattractive to us. Nature has programmed us to not be sexually turned on by the unhealthy, and that includes fat people. You\u2019re a bigot. How can my personal tastes and preferences make me a bigot? Am I a bigot because I don\u2019t like Lord of the Rings or Jerry Lewis movies or watching two guys kiss? So you\u2019re a homophobe! My stash of lesbian porn says different, and I\u2019m not discriminating against fat people, saying we should not hire them or give them housing. I just don\u2019t want to see them in underwear catalogs. People should be allowed to live their lives however they wish. You keep saying that even as you bully me over my personal beliefs. You\u2019re a monster for not lying about this. Fat women need your support. What they need is a treadmill. John McCain Was an Honorable, Patriotic, Super-Duper American This is my favorite thoughtcrime. Maybe my all-time favorite. Why? Because I\u2019m old enough to remember when the media told me McCain was an old, white, racist, womanizing, corrupt war criminal. But that was back in \u201908 when he was the only thing between a Democrat and the White House. Today, however, he is St. John McCain. Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy can trash the late Ronald Reagan all she wants with no repercussions, but President Trump criticizing McCain\u2019s dishonorable role in a number of dishonorable acts \u2014 why you\u2019d think Trump was hiring Russian hookers to pee on a bed Obama slept in, or something. And it goes like this\u2026 John McCain was one of the greatest and most honorable Americans who ever lived. Ten years ago you told me he was a racist war criminal. Ten years ago you voted for him. Because my only other choice was socialist who hung out with domestic terrorists. Shame on you. John McCain was a war hero. Yes, he was a war hero, but even war heroes can grow into bitter, dishonest, and petty old men \u2014 and that is what happened to John McCain. You\u2019re only saying that to side with Trump. I\u2019ve despised John McCain since the aughts, since he constantly undermined President George W. Bush as payback for losing the 2000 primary and as a means to seek favor with the establishment media because he knew he would run for president again in 2008. John McCain was a preening, narcissistic peacock 15 years before he launched this feud with Trump. And yes, he did launch this feud with Trump. McCain started it. John McCain was honorable to the end. He wasn\u2019t all bad, but he was one of the Keating Five and his fascist attempt to protect incumbency by criminalizing political speech through the McCain-Feingold Act is the most un-American pieces of legislation passed in the last 50 years. What\u2019s more, his neurotic and narcissistic need to be seen as \u201chonorable\u201d resulted in him suspending his presidential campaign \u2014 the single most dumbest thing I have ever witnessed. How dare you speak the truth about an honorable man! Tell me what\u2019s honorable about giving your word to voters over the course of a decade about repealing Obamacare and then breaking your word so you can bathe in a news-cycle? What\u2019s honorable about attacking the powerless or planning your own never-ending funeral, a funeral longer than a presidential funeral, and premising it on your own spite? What\u2019s honorable about never letting go of grudges? What\u2019s honorable about trying to make Hillary Clinton president by spreading a dossier filled with lies to your pals in the media? McCain is dead, yes, but he died a petty, grasping, dishonest, backstabbing old man. As if Trump is perfect. As if you freaks demand I say he is. You shouldn\u2019t speak ill of the dead. Don\u2019t force me to by demanding I swallow your lies. We should end this debate on common ground. Meghan McCain is a horrible person. I\u2019ll drink to that. \u2014 You see what\u2019s happening? Corporate power is not arguing with us, is not debating us\u2026 which would be fine. Rather, these fascist corporations are creating actual \u201cthoughtcrimes,\u201d not only by criminalizing certain beliefs and opinions, but the belief in something scientifically true. Men cannot become women. Lena Dunham\u2019s naked body is disgusting. John McCain was not a good man. Sorry, he just wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t like saying that about a dead man, but I won\u2019t be bullied into silence in the face of all these revisionist lies. Trump has every right to be furious with McCain. Yes, he may be dead, but as Michelle Malkin put it so well, his dishonorable legacy lives through the victims of Obamacare and the phony Russia dossier. And if the media don\u2019t want to see McCain criticized, they should stop asking Trump about McCain. But the media do keep asking because they know Trump is guilty of thoughtcrime, of not holding the \u201capproved\u201d opinion of McCain, and asking about McCain allows the media to keep punishing that particular thoughtcrime. It is sick and un-American, to say the least. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.",

In the book\u00a0The Restless Wave, McCain provides an inside account of how he says he came across the dossier. He writes that he was told about the claims in the document at a security conference in Canada in November 2016, where he was approached by Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow and friend of ex-British spy Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier. McCain wrote that Wood told him Steele \u201chad been commissioned to investigate connections between the Trump campaign and Russian agents as well as potentially compromising information about the President-elect that Putin allegedly possessed.\u201d McCain, however, did not address the obvious question of whether he was told exactly who \u201ccommissioned\u201d Steele to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the alleged Russian ties. The dossier was commissioned by the controversial Fusion GPS opposition research firm, which was paid for its anti-Trump work by Trump\u2019s primary political opponents, namely Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm. McCain goes on to describe Wood as telling him Steele\u2019s work \u201cwas mostly raw, unverified intelligence, but that the author strongly believed merited a thorough examination by counterintelligence experts.\u201d The politician says the dossier claims described to him were \u201ctoo strange a scenario to believe, something out of a le Carr\u00e9 novel, not the kind of thing anyone has ever actually had to worry about with a new President, no matter what other concerns.\u201d Still, McCain says he reasoned that \u201ceven a remote risk that the President of the United States might be vulnerable to Russian extortion had to be investigated.\u201d McCain concedes Wood told him he had not actually read the dossier himself, and writes that he wasn\u2019t sure if he ever met Wood before and couldn\u2019t recall previously having a conversation with Wood. Still, McCain took Wood\u2019s word for it when Wood vouched for Steele\u2019s credibility. \u201cSteele was a respected professional, Wood assured us, who had good Russian contacts and long experience collecting and analyzing intelligence on the Kremlin,\u201d McCain wrote. Present at the meeting with Wood and McCain was David J. Kramer, a former State Department official and longtime McCain associate who agreed to \u201cgo to London to meet Steele, confirm his credibility and report back to me.\u201d McCain doesn\u2019t detail Kramer\u2019s visit to London beyond simply writing, \u201cWhen David returned, and shared his impression that the former spy was, as Sir Andrew had vouched, a respected professional, and not to outward appearances given to hyperbole or hysteria, I agreed to receive a copy of what is now referred to as \u2018the dossier.\u2019\u2019\u2019 McCain leaves out exactly where Kramer obtained his dossier copy. The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported\u00a0in February that Kramer received the dossier directly from Fusion GPS after McCain expressed interest in it. Those details marked the clearest indication that McCain may have known that the dossier originated with Fusion GPS, meaning that he may have knowingly passed on political material to the FBI. Also, in a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0oped\u00a0in January, GPS co-founders Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritch wrote that they helped McCain share their anti-Trump dossier with the Obama-era intelligence community via an unnamed \u201cemissary.\u201d Without mentioning Fusion GPS, McCain goes on to briefly describe turning over the dossier to Comey: The allegations were disturbing, but I had no idea which if any were true. I could not independently verify any of it, and so I did what any American who cares about our nation\u2019s security should have done. I put the dossier in my office safe, called the office of the Director of the FBI Jim Comey and asked for a meeting. I went to see him at his earliest convenience, handed him the dossier, explained how it had come into my possession. I said I didn\u2019t know what to make of it, and I trusted the FBI would examine it carefully and investigate its claims. With that, I thanked the director and left. The entire meeting had probably not lasted longer than ten minutes. I did what duty demanded I do. I don\u2019t know what is true, partially true or not true in the dossier. I gave it to the people best equipped to answer those questions. Had I done any more, I would have exceeded my capability. Had I done any less I would be ashamed of myself. And if any of my colleagues in Congress had been in my situation and not done what I did, I would be ashamed of them. McCain implies he was essentially targeted as an appropriate venue to deliver the dossier to the FBI due to his hawkish views on Putin and Russia: Why had I been given the dossier? That\u2019s the first accusatory question in every budding conspiracy theory about my minor role in the controversy. The answer is too obvious for the paranoid to credit. I am known internationally to be a persistent critic of Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime, and I have been for a long while. Wood and Steele likely assumed that my animosity toward Putin, which I unapologetically acknowledge, ensured that I would take their concerns seriously. They assumed correctly. A few weeks after McCain gave Steele\u2019s dossier to Comey on Dec. 9, 2016, the FBI chief updated then President-Elect Trump and President Obama on the dossier in a classified briefing. As Breitbart News\u00a0documented, Comey\u2019s dossier briefing to Trump was subsequently leaked to the news media, setting in motion a flurry of news media attention on the dossier, including the release of the document to the public. The briefing also may have provided the veneer of respectability to a document that had been circulating for months within the news media but widely considered too unverified to publicize.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " The context was President Trump\u2019s renewed criticism of McCain after a newly-released deposition showed how deeply McCain was involved in the fraudulent \u201cRussia dossier\u201d that has been used to attack the administration and divide the nation. Brazile, who Fox News recently hired as a contributor, began by criticizing the president for speaking ill of the dead. She then continued: \u201cJohn McCain leaves a legacy. He leaves a legacy of sacrifice. \u2026 John McCain should be honored for his service.\u201d It is heart-warming to read tributes to McCain from people who ignored his heroism and sacrifice and smeared his character when he ran against Barack Obama and, later, criticized him as president. In 2014, for example, Brazile tweeted a hit piece on McCain, \u201cThe Vacant Soul of Senator John McCain.\u201d She added: \u201cInteresting article.\u201d   The article was a response to McCain\u2019s criticism of Obama for the Bowe Berghdal prisoner swap, in which the U.S. freed five major Taliban terrorists from Guantanamo Bay. McCain, a prisoner-of-war himself in Vietnam for five-and-a-half years, nevertheless criticized the deal. (Berghdal was later convicted of desertion.) What Brazile called an \u201cinteresting article\u201d was a mean-spirited personal attack, with lines such as: \u201cMcCain had so much sunshine blown up his ass that his colon must have looked like Cabo San Lucas.\u201d It referred to the war hero as a \u201csmall boy,\u201d and accused him of handing U.S. foreign policy to corrupt \u201cspooks and crooks.\u201d When McCain was alive, and \u2014 as it happens \u2014 in the right, Brazile said he had a \u201cvacant soul.\u201d Now she is his number-one fan. The media do not love McCain for his service, which many did their best to ignore. No \u2014 the media love him as a foil to other Republicans \u2014 a role he has relished playing from the time he was the maverick alternative to George W. Bush during the 2000 Republican primary. They hated him when he was an effective critic of Obama\u2019s foreign policy. They loved him again when he feuded with Trump in the 2015-6 election. McCain made sure the feud would continue beyond his death. The media loved it, too: \u201cMr. McCain had carefully stage-managed a four-day celebration of his life \u2014 but what was also an unmistakable rebuke to President Trump and his agenda,\u201d the New York Times wrote. At the time, Trump swallowed his pride. Now that he is talking about McCain again, the last people to criticize the president should be those, like Donna Brazile, who trashed him while he was living, and when it mattered. Joel B.

      "content": " Breitbart News has independently confirmed an earlier report in\u00a0People magazine, which reported that Palin was not sent an invitation and was told through intermediaries to stay away from the ceremony. McCain fundraiser\u00a0Carla Eudy confirmed to\u00a0People that Palin had not been invited \u2014 possibly,\u00a0People speculated, at the behest of the McCain family. The news comes on the tenth anniversary of the date in 2008 when Palin was announced as McCain\u2019s pick for vice president. Palin now joins President Donald Trump on the list of those barred from the funeral. But unlike Trump, Palin never feuded with McCain and never criticized him. When news broke on Saturday of McCain\u2019s passing, Palin said, \u201cToday we lost an American original. Sen. John McCain was a maverick and a fighter, never afraid to stand for his beliefs. John never took the easy path in life \u2014 and through sacrifice and suffering he inspired others to serve something greater than self. \u201cJohn McCain was my friend. I will remember the good times. My family and I send prayers for Cindy and the McCain family.\u201d Last year, when McCain was reported to have\u00a0said that he regretted choosing Palin instead of Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT), Palin described the news as a \u201cgut punch\u201d but refused to blame McCain personally, telling the UK\u00a0Daily Mail that she blamed his \u201cghostwriters\u201d for such reports. When McCain selected Palin as his running mate, the two had both built reputations as corruption-busting \u201cmaverick\u201d leaders who were not afraid to buck their own parties. After the 2008 election, they moved in separate political directions. Palin became an inspirational figure for the Tea Party and for grassroots conservatives in general. McCain campaigned as a conservative border hawk in his 2010 re-election race but became a harsh critic of the Tea Party, calling Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rand Paul (R-KY) \u201cwacko birds.\u201d Many in the Beltway blamed Palin for McCain\u2019s loss in 2008 \u2014 even though Barack Obama had benefited from a sudden financial crisis and a biased press corps. That view seemed to have seeped into McCain\u2019s own thinking. Still, Palin never took offense and always honored McCain. Even after being excluded from the funeral, she declined to criticize him. People quoted a source close to the Palin family: \u201c[O]ut of respect for Sen. McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point. The Palin family will always cherish their friendship with the McCains and hold those memories dear.\u201d McCain will be laid to rest on Sunday in Annapolis, following several days of memorial events and ceremonies.

After several of the employees shouted \u201cYes!\u201d Trump continued,\u00a0\u201cI have to be honest. I never liked him much. Hasn\u2019t been for me. I really probably never will.\u201d Here is Trump\u2019s list of grievances: 1) McCain helped distribute the phony Russia dossier to the FBI and the media Trump said: John McCain received the fake and phony dossier, it was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton. And John McCain got it. He got it And what did he do? He didn\u2019t call me, he turned it over to the FBI hoping to put me in jeopardy and that\u2019s not the nicest thing to do \u2026 because I\u2019m a very loyal person. 2) McCain cratered attempt to repeal Obamacare by voting \u201cNo.\u201d Trump said: John McCain campaigned for years to repeal Obamacare in Arizona \u2026 when he finally had the chance to do it, he voted against repeal and replace. He voted against at 2:00 in the morning, remember thumbs down? We said \u2018What the hell happened?\u2019 He said two hours before he was voting to heal and replace. Then he went thumbs down, badly hurting the Republican party badly hurting our nation and hurting many sick people who desperately wanted good, affordable health care. 3) McCain failed to help veterans Trump said: McCain didn\u2019t get the job done for our great vets in the VA. And they knew it, that\u2019s why when I had my dispute with him, I had such incredible support from the vets and from the military. The vets were on my side because I got the job done. I got choice and I got accountability. 4) McCain pushed for America to get into the Iraq War and the Middle East Trump said: The other thing is we\u2019re in a war in the middle east that McCain pushed so hard. He was calling Bush, President Bush all the time. \u2018Get into the Middle East. Get into the Middle East,\u2019 So now we\u2019re into that war for $7 trillion, thousands and thousands of our people have been killed, millions of people overall. And frankly, we\u2019re straightening it out now, but it has been a disaster for our country. We\u2019ve have spent tremendous wealth, and tremendous lives in that war. And what do we have? It is worse than 19 years ago. I called them \u2018The Endless Wars\u2019 \u2026 John McCain loved it. 5) McCain Betrayed Him Even Though Donald Trump Endorsed Him \u201cI endorsed him at his request,\u201d Trump recalled. 6) Trump Never got thanked by the McCain family for giving them the \u201cfuneral that he wanted.\u201d Trump said: I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve. I don\u2019t care about this. I didn\u2019t get thank you. That\u2019s okay. We sent him on the way, but I wasn\u2019t a fan of John McCain. Trump tried to put the issue to rest, telling the group of workers that he was \u201csaving time with the press\u201d later as the issue continued to fascinate reporters in the establishment media. \u201cSo now what we can say, now we\u2019re all set I don\u2019t think I have to answer that question but the press keeps [asking], \u2018What do you think of McCain, what do you think?'\u201d Trump concluded. \u201cNot my kind of guy, but some people like him and I think that\u2019s great.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "EILAT, Israel \u2014 The founders of the controversial opposition research firm Fusion GPS admitted that they helped the researcher hired to compile the infamous, largely discredited 35-page dossier on President Donald Trump to share the document with Sen. John McCain.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " The goal of providing the dossier to McCain, the Fusion GPS founders explained, was to pass the information contained in the questionable document to the U.S. intelligence community under the Obama administration. The disclosure raises questions about whether McCain knew that the information he delivered to the intelligence community was actually an opposition document reportedly funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. McCain\u2019s office did not reply yesterday to a Breitbart News request for comment on the matter. Last December, it was revealed that it was McCain who notoriously\u00a0passed\u00a0the controversial dossier documents produced by the Washington opposition research firm Fusion GPS to then FBI Director James Comey, whose agency reportedly\u00a0utilized\u00a0the dossier as\u00a0a basis for its probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Writing in a New York Times oped last Tuesday, Fusion GPS founders Glenn R. Simpson and Peter Fritch relate that they helped McCain share their anti-Trump dossier with the intelligence community via an \u201cemissary.\u201d \u201cAfter the election, Mr. Steele decided to share his intelligence with Senator John McCain via an emissary,\u201d the Fusion GPS founders related. \u201cWe helped him do that. The goal was to alert the United States national security community to an attack on our country by a hostile foreign power.\u201d It was not clear from their statement whether McCain knew Fusion GPS was behind the dossier.\u00a0Fusion GPS paid former intelligence agent Christopher Steele to do the purported research for the document. Steele later\u00a0conceded\u00a0in court documents that part of his work still needed to be verified. Breitbart News sent the following questions to McCain\u2019s office but did not receive a reply before press time: \u201cGiven that Fusion GPS is openly an opposition research firm, did Sen. McCain know that he was sharing political opposition research on Trump with the intel community? Did he know the dossier was partially funded by the DNC and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign?\u201d In October, the Washington Post\u00a0reported\u00a0that in April 2016, attorney Marc E. Elias and his law firm, Perkins Coie retained Fusion GPS to conduct the questionable anti-Trump work on behalf of both the Clinton campaign and the DNC. Through Perkins Coie, Clinton\u2019s campaign and the DNC continued to fund Fusion GPS until October 2016, days before Election Day, the\u00a0Post\u00a0reported. On January 10, CNN was first to\u00a0report, based on leaked information, that the contents of the dossier were presented during classified briefings one week earlier to then-president Obama and president-elect Trump. Just after CNN\u2019s January 10 report on the classified briefings about the dossier, BuzzFeed\u00a0published\u00a0its full unverified contents. In October, McCain denied providing the dossier to BuzzFeed and said that he only gave the material to the FBI. \u201cI gave it to no one except for the director of the FBI. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re digging this up now,\u201d McCain\u00a0told\u00a0the Daily Caller during what the news website described as a testy exchange. While the Fusion GPS oped sheds some light on the manner in which McCain obtained the dossier, the Fusion founders did not name the \u201cemissary\u201d who delivered the document to McCain. A January 11 statement from McCain attempted to explain why he provided the documents to the FBI but did not mention how he\u00a0came to possess the dossier or whether he knew who funded it. \u201cUpon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,\u201d McCain\u00a0said\u00a0at the time. \u201cThat has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.\u201d Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow,\u00a0said\u00a0McCain first consulted him about the claims inside the dossier at a security conference in Canada shortly after last November\u2019s presidential election. Wood stated that McCain had obtained the documents from the senator\u2019s own sources. \u201cI told him I was aware of what was in the report but I had not read it myself, that it might be true, it might be untrue. I had no means of judging really,\u201d Wood further told BBC Radio 4 in January. Last Month, Wood related that he served as a \u201cgo-between\u201d to inform McCain about the dossier contents. \u201cMy mission was essentially to be a go-between and a messenger, to tell the senator and assistants that such a dossier existed,\u201d Wood told Fox News. In March,\u00a0Vanity Fair\u00a0raised\u00a0questions\u00a0about the alleged involvement of David J. Kramer, a former State Department official, in helping to obtain the dossier directly from Steele. The issue was also\u00a0raised\u00a0in a lawsuit filed against Steele by one of the individuals named in the dossier. The dossier contains wild and unproven claims that the Russians had information regarding Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the widely mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed.\u00a0 It also claimed there was an exchange of information between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government. Those allegations remain unsubstantiated following numerous public hearings. Indeed, former CIA Director John Brennan made clear in\u00a0testimony\u00a0last May that after viewing all of the evidence that was available to him on the Russia probe he is not aware of any collusion between Russia and members of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Dossier was reportedly basis for Obama administration moves According to the BBC, the dossier\u00a0served\u00a0as a \u201croadmap\u201d for the FBI\u2019s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign during the Obama administration. In April, CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0that the dossier served as part of the FBI\u2019s justification for seeking the FISA court\u2019s reported approval to clandestinely monitor the communications of Carter Page, the American oil industry investor who was tangentially and briefly associated with Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Senior Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have\u00a0reportedly\u00a0requested that the FBI and Department of Justice turn over applications for any warrants to monitor the communications of U.S. citizens associated with the investigation into alleged Russia interference in the 2016 presidential election. In testimony last May, former FBI Director James Comey\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0refused to answer questions about his agency\u2019s ties to the dossier. In further\u00a0testimony\u00a0to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Comey admitted he pushed back against a request from President Donald Trump to possibly investigate the origins of \u201csalacious material\u201d that the agency possessed in the course of its investigation into alleged Russian interference. Dossier discredited Major questions have been raised as to the veracity of the dossier, large sections of which have been discredited. Citing a \u201cKremlin insider,\u201d the dossier, which misspelled the name of a Russian diplomat, claimed that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen held \u201csecret meetings\u201d with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016. That charge unraveled after Cohen\u00a0revealed\u00a0he had never traveled to Prague, calling the story \u201ctotally fake, totally inaccurate.\u201d The\u00a0Atlantic\u00a0confirmed Cohen\u2019s whereabouts in New York and California during the period the dossier claimed that\u00a0Cohen was in Prague. Cohen reportedly produced his passport showing he had not traveled to Prague. In testimony in May, the FBI\u2019s Comey\u00a0confirmed\u00a0that the basis for the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia allegedly wanted Trump in office was not because the billionaire was, as Sen. Al Franken (D-MN)\u00a0claimed during a hearing, \u201censnared in\u201d Russia\u2019s \u201cweb of patronage\u201d \u2013 just as the dossier alleged. Instead, the FBI chief provided two primary reasons for Russia\u2019s alleged favoring of Trump over Clinton during the 2016 presidential race. One reason, according to Comey, was that Putin \u201chated\u201d Clinton and would have favored any Republican opponent. The second reason, Comey explained, was that Putin made an assessment that it would be easier to make a deal with a businessman than someone from the political class. Comey\u2019s statements are a far cry from the conspiracies\u00a0fueled\u00a0by the dossier alleging Putin held blackmail information on Trump. Citing current and former government officials, the\u00a0New Yorker\u00a0reported\u00a0the dossier prompted skepticism among intelligence community members, with the publication quoting one member saying it was a \u201cnutty\u201d piece of evidence to submit to a U.S. president. Steele\u2019s work has been\u00a0questioned\u00a0by former acting CIA Director Michael Morell, who currently works at the Hillary Clinton-tied Beacon Global Strategies LLC. NBC News\u00a0reported\u00a0on Morell\u2019s questions about Steele\u2019s credibility: Morell, who was in line to become CIA director if Clinton won, said he had seen no evidence that Trump associates cooperated with Russians. He also raised questions about the dossier written by a former British intelligence officer, which alleged a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. \u2026 Morell pointed out that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on Meet the Press on March 5 that he had seen no evidence of a conspiracy when he left office January 20. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty strong statement by General Clapper,\u201d Morell said. Regarding Steele\u2019s dossier, Morell stated, \u201cUnless you know the sources, and unless you know how a particular source acquired a particular piece of information, you can\u2019t judge the information \u2014 you just can\u2019t.\u201d Morell charged the dossier \u201cdoesn\u2019t take you anywhere, I don\u2019t think.\u201d \u201cI had two questions when I first read it. One was, how did Chris talk to these sources? I have subsequently learned that he used intermediaries.\u201d Morell continued: And then I asked myself, why did these guys provide this information, what was their motivation? And I subsequently learned that he paid them. That the intermediaries paid the sources and the intermediaries got the money from Chris. And that kind of worries me a little bit because if you\u2019re paying somebody, particularly former FSB [Russian intelligence] officers, they are going to tell you truth and innuendo and rumor, and they\u2019re going to call you up and say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s have another meeting, I have more information for you,\u201d because they want to get paid some more. I think you\u2019ve got to take all that into consideration when you consider the dossier. Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " During an interview with Politico\u2018s Women Rule podcast, McCain said the party of Trump \u2014 centered around a pro-U.S. worker agenda \u2014 is not what she and her late husband were a part of. \u201cWe have, on my side of the aisle, on the Republican side, we see a local party in Arizona that\u2019s not functioning well,\u201d McCain said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s excluding people. And it\u2019s excluding people for the wrong reasons.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re not walking the line, then you\u2019re out,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s just not right. That\u2019s not the party that my husband and I belonged to.\u201d McCain also seemed to take subtle jabs at Trump\u2019s way of communicating with his supporters, bypassing the establishment media and pundit class. \u201cI think we\u2019ve seen the end of men like my husband. At least for right now,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThe inability to even discuss issues \u2014 differing issues \u2014 it\u2019s degenerated into name-calling and Twitter responses, and all of these things that not only do they not help the argument, but they don\u2019t help foster good relationships with people,\u201d McCain said. While McCain\u2019s husband lost the 2008 presidential election running on the decades-long Republican establishment platform of neoconservative foreign interventionism, extending the Bush-era tax cuts, and amnesty for illegal aliens, Trump swept to victory in 2016 with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda of a travel ban from terrorist-sponsored countries, a promise to bring U.S. troops home, and a commitment to pulling out of multilateral free trade deals and global agreements like TPP and the Paris Climate Accord. Trump\u2019s economic nationalist platform won him majorities in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania \u2014 states not won by Republicans in years. In a March 2019 poll by Harvard/Harris, about three-in-four U.S. voters said they support a nationalist-populist approach to trade, immigration, and foreign policy \u2014 that is, tariffs on foreign imports to protect American industries, less immigration, and less foreign intervention overseas. Last year, former presidential candidate and columnist Pat Buchanan said\u00a0McCain\u2019s preferred part of former President George W. Bush\u2019s party had \u201cbecome a Trump party\u201d on all the defining issues of the time. \u201cThe Bush party has become a Trump party,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201c\u2026 On the new issues, the populist conservative issues\u2014control of the border, immigration, economic nationalism versus free trade, staying out of foreign wars that get us entangled and bleeding and accomplish nothing, \u2018America First\u2019\u2014[the GOP] has become the Trump party now.\u201d John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

      "subtitle": "TEL AVIV \u2014 David Kramer, a long-time advisor to late Senator John McCain, revealed that he met with two Obama administration officials to inquire about whether the anti-Trump dossier authored by former British spy Christopher Steele was being taken seriously.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " In one case, Kramer said that he personally provided a copy of the dossier to Obama National Security Council official Celeste Wallander. In a deposition on Dec. 13, 2017 that was recently posted online, Kramer said that McCain specifically asked him in early December 2016 to meet about the dossier with Wallander and Victoria Nuland, a senior official in John Kerry\u2019s State Department. \u201cSenator McCain asked me to meet with both of them to see if this was being taken seriously in the government,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cAnd Senator McCain asked you to meet with them?\u201d Kramer was asked to clarify. \u201cYes, just to see if this was being taken seriously. I think he wanted to do \u2014 this was his kind of due diligence before he went to Director Comey.\u201d Kramer testified that in his conversations with Nuland and Wallander he was told by both of them that each were aware of the dossier and that Nuland \u201cthought Steele was a serious person.\u201d Kramer revealed that he gave a copy of the dossier to Wallander, who was familiar with the contents but did not have a copy. \u201cI had a subsequent conversation with Ms. Wallander in which I gave her a copy of the document. That was probably around New Year\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had not seen it herself until I had shown it to her,\u201d Kramer added. \u201cShe had heard about it. And she didn\u2019t know the status of it.\u201d In the same testimony, the McCain associate revealed that he held a meeting about the dossier with a reporter from BuzzFeed News who he says snapped photos of the controversial document without Kramer\u2019s permission when he left the room to go to the bathroom. That meeting was held at the McCain Institute office in Washington, Kramer stated. BuzzFeed infamously published Steele\u2019s full dossier on January 10, 2017 setting off a firestorm of news media coverage about the document. Prior to his death, McCain admitted to personally handing the dossier to then-FBI Director James Comey but he refused repeated requests for comment about whether he had a role in providing the dossier to BuzzFeed, including numerous inquiries sent to his office by this reporter. In his book published last year, McCain maintained he had an \u201cobligation\u201d to pass the dossier charges against Trump to Comey and he would even do it again. \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t like it can go to hell,\u201d McCain exclaimed. Kramer, meanwhile, also said that he briefed others reporters on the dossier contents, including CNN\u2019s Carl Bernstein, in an effort to have the anti-Trump charges verified. The same day BuzzFeed released the full dossier, CNN\u00a0 first reported the leaked information that the controversial contents of the dossier were presented during classified briefings inside classified documents presented one week earlier to then-President Obama and President-elect Trump. Kramer said that he believed McCain was sought out in order to provide credibility to the dossier claims. \u201cI think they felt a senior Republican was better to be the recipient of this rather than a Democrat because if it were a Democrat, I think that the view was that it would have been dismissed as a political attack,\u201d Kramer stated. The controversial Fusion GPS firm hired Steele to do the anti-Trump work that resulted in the compilation of the dossier.\u00a0 Fusion GPS was paid for its anti-Trump work by Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee via the Perkins Coie law firm. Kramer\u2019s testimony sheds a new light on the role of the Obama administration in disseminating the largely-discredited dossier that was reportedly involved in the FBI\u2019s initial investigation into the Trump campaign and unsubstantiated claims of Russian collusion. Also Comey cited the dossier as evidence in a successful FISA application to obtain a warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, a former adviser to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. The testimony also revealed how McCain was utilized to give the wild dossier charges a credibility boost. Nuland and dossier Nuland\u2019s specific role in the dossier episode has been the subject of some controversy for her. In their book, \u201cRussian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin\u2019s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump,\u201d authors and reporters by Michael Isikoff and David Corn write that Nuland gave the green light for the FBI to first meet with Steele regarding his dossier\u2019s claims. It was at that meeting that Steele initially reported his dossier charges to the FBI, the book relates. Steele sought out Rome-based FBI Special Agent Michael Gaeta, with whom he had worked on a previous case. Before Gaeta met with Steele on July 5, 2016, the book relates that the FBI first secured the support of Nuland, who at the time was assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs specializing in Russia. Regarding the arrangements for Steele\u2019s initial meeting with the FBI about the dossier claims, Isikoff and Corn report: There were a few hoops Gaeta had to jump through. He was assigned to the U.S. embassy in Rome. The FBI checked with Victoria Nuland\u2019s office at the State Department : Do you support this meeting ? Nuland, having found Steele\u2019s reports on Ukraine to have been generally credible, gave the green light. Within a few days, on July 5, Gaeta arrived and headed to Steele\u2019s office near Victoria station . Steele handed him a copy of the report. Gaeta, a seasoned FBI agent, started to read . He turned white. For a while, Gaeta said nothing . Then he remarked, \u201cI have to report this to headquarters.\u201d The book documents that Nuland previously received Steele\u2019s reports on the Ukrainian crisis and had been familiar with Steele\u2019s general work. Nuland faced confirmation questions prior to her appointment as assistant secretary of state over her reported role in revising controversial Obama administration talking points about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks. Her reported changes sought to protect Clinton\u2019s State Department from accusations that it failed to adequately secure the woefully unprotected U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi. Nuland\u2019s name surfaced in a flurry of news media reports last year about the dossier and Kerry\u2019s State Department. Sidney Blumenthal An extensive New Yorker profile of Steele named another former official from Kerry\u2019s State Department for alleged involvement in circulating the dossier. The magazine reported that Kerry\u2019s chief of staff at the State Department, John Finer, obtained the contents of a two-page summary of the dossier and eventually decided to share the questionable document with Kerry. Finer received the dossier summary from Jonathan M. Winer, the Obama State Department official who acknowledged regularly interfacing and exchanging information with Steele, according to the report. Winer previously conceded that he shared the dossier summary with Nuland. After his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with Steele. Winer further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an \u201cold friend.\u201d Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal \u2013 which Winer in turn gave to Steele \u2013 originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals. Nuland, Winer Give Conflicting Accounts There are seeming discrepancies between Winer and Nuland about actions taken involving the dossier. Nuland described in a Politico podcast interview what she claimed was her reaction when she was presented with Steele\u2019s dossier information at the State Department. She said that she offered advice to \u201cthose who were interfacing with\u201d Steele, immediately telling the intermediary or intermediaries that Steele \u201cshould get this information to the FBI.\u201d She further explained that a career employee at the State Department could not get involved with the dossier charges since such actions could violate the Hatch Act, which prevents employees in the executive branch of the federal government from engaging in certain kinds of political activities. In a second interview, this one with CBS\u2019s Face The Nation, Nuland also stated that her \u201cimmediate\u201d reaction was to refer Steele to the FBI. Here is a transcript of the relevant section of her February 5 interview with Susan B. Glasser, who described Nuland as \u201cmy friend\u201d and referred to her by her nickname \u201cToria\u201d: Glasser: When did you first hear about his dossier? Nuland: I first heard \u2014 and I didn\u2019t know who his client was until much later, until 2017, I think, when it came out. I first heard that he had done work for a client asserting these linkages \u2014 I think it was late July, something like that. Glasser: That\u2019s very interesting. And you would have taken him seriously just because you knew that he knew what he was talking about on Russia? Nuland: What I did was say that this is about U.S. politics, and not the work of \u2014 not the business of the State Department, and certainly not the business of a career employee who is subject to the Hatch Act, which requires that you stay out of politics. So, my advice to those who were interfacing with him was that he should get this information to the FBI, and that they could evaluate whether they thought it was credible. Glasser: Did you ever talk about it with anyone else higher up at the department? With Secretary Kerry or anybody else? Nuland: Secretary Kerry was also aware. I think he\u2019s on the record and he had the same advice. Nuland stated that Kerry \u201cwas also aware\u201d of the dossier, but she did not describe how he was made aware. She made clear that she told \u201cthose who were interfacing\u201d with Steele to go to the FBI since any State Department involvement could violate the Hatch Act. Her Politico podcast interview was not the only time she claimed that her reaction was to refer Steele to the FBI. On Face The Nation on February 4, Nuland engaged in the following exchange in which she stated her \u201cimmediate\u201d reaction was to refer Steele to the FBI (emphasis added): MARGARET BRENNAN: The dossier. VICTORIA NULAND: The dossier, he passed two to four pages of short points of what he was finding, and\u00a0our immediate reaction to that was, \u201cThis is not in our purview. This needs to go to the FBI,\u00a0if there is any concern here that one candidate or the election as a whole might be influenced by the Russian federation. That\u2019s something for the FBI to investigate.\u201d And that was our reaction when we saw this. It\u2019s not our \u2014 we can\u2019t evaluate this. And frankly, if every member of the campaign who the Russians tried to approach and tried to influence had gone to the FBI as well in real time, we might not be in the mess we\u2019re in today. Nuland gave the two interviews after her name started surfacing in news media reports involving\u00a0Kerry\u2019s State Department and the dossier. Her name also came up in relation to a criminal referral of Steele to the Justice Department in the form of a\u00a0 letter authored last year by Sen. Chuck Grassley, who at the time chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). The Grassley-Graham criminal referral\u00a0contains\u00a0redacted information that Steele received information from someone in the State Department, who in turn had been in contact with a \u201cforeign sub-source\u201d who was in touch with a redacted name described as a \u201cfriend of the Clintons.\u201d Numerous media reports have since stated that the source of information provided to the State Department that was in turn passed on to Steele was Cody Shearer, a controversial figure tied to the Clintons who is also an associate of longtime Clinton friend Sidney Blumenthal. According to sources who\u00a0spoke to\u00a0CNN, Shearer\u2019s information was passed from Blumenthal to Winer, who at the time was a special State Department envoy for Libya working under Kerry. Winer says that Kerry personally recruited him to work at the State Department. It is Winer\u2019s version of events that seems to conflict with Nuland\u2019s. In an\u00a0oped\u00a0published in the\u00a0Washington Post, Winer identified Nuland as the State Department official with whom he shared Steele\u2019s information. Winer writes that Nuland\u2019s reaction was that \u201cshe felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material.\u201d He does not relate any further reaction from Nuland. Winer wrote in the Washington Post (emphasis added): In the summer of 2016, Steele told me that he had learned of disturbing information regarding possible ties between Donald Trump, his campaign and senior Russian officials. He did not provide details but made clear the information involved \u201cactive measures,\u201d a Soviet intelligence term for propaganda and related activities to influence events in other countries. In September 2016, Steele and I met in Washington and discussed the information now known as the \u201cdossier.\u201d Steele\u2019s sources suggested that the Kremlin not only had been behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign but also had compromised Trump and developed ties with his associates and campaign. I was allowed to review, but not to keep, a copy of these reports to enable me to alert the State Department. I prepared a two-page summary and shared it with Nuland, who indicated that, like me, she felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material. That was the extent of Winer\u2019s description of Nuland\u2019s reaction upon being presented with Steele\u2019s dossier claims. Nuland\u2019s public claim that her \u201cimmediate\u201d response was to refer Steele to the FBI since State involvement could violate the Hatch Act seems to conflict with the only reaction that Winer relates from Nuland \u2013 that she felt Kerry should be made aware of the dossier information. In Winer\u2019s Washington Post oped, he writes that Steele had a larger relationship with the State Department, passing over 100 reports relating to Russia to the U.S. government agency through Winer. Winer wrote that Nuland found Steele\u2019s reports to be \u201cuseful\u201d and asked Winer to \u201ccontinue to send them.\u201d He wrote: In 2013, I returned to the State Department at the request of Secretary of State John F. Kerry, whom I had previously served as Senate counsel. Over the years, Steele and I had discussed many matters relating to Russia. He asked me whether the State Department would like copies of new information as he developed it. I contacted Victoria Nuland, a career diplomat who was then assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, and shared with her several of Steele\u2019s reports. She told me they were useful and asked me to continue to send them. Over the next two years, I shared more than 100 of Steele\u2019s reports with the Russia experts at the State Department, who continued to find them useful. None of the reports related to U.S. politics or domestic U.S. matters, and the reports constituted a very small portion of the data set reviewed by State Department experts trying to make sense of events in Russia. Kramer and the dossier In his book, \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d McCain provided an inside account of how he says he came across the dossier. He wrote that he was told about the claims in the document at a security conference in Canada in November 2016, where he was approached by Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow and friend of ex-British spy Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier. McCain wrote that Wood told him Steele \u201chad been commissioned to investigate connections between the Trump campaign and Russian agents as well as potentially compromising information about the President-elect that Putin allegedly possessed.\u201d McCain, however, did not address the obvious question of whether he was told exactly who \u201ccommissioned\u201d Steele to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the alleged Russian ties.\u00a0 The dossier was paid for by Clinton\u2019s campaign and the DNC. McCain goes on to describe Wood as telling him Steele\u2019s work \u201cwas mostly raw, unverified intelligence, but that the author strongly believed merited a thorough examination by counterintelligence experts.\u201d The politician says the dossier claims described to him were \u201ctoo strange a scenario to believe, something out of a le Carr\u00e9 novel, not the kind of thing anyone has ever actually had to worry about with a new President, no matter what other concerns.\u201d Still, McCain says he reasoned that \u201ceven a remote risk that the President of the United States might be vulnerable to Russian extortion had to be investigated.\u201d McCain concedes Wood told him he had not actually read the dossier himself, and writes that he wasn\u2019t sure if he ever met Wood before and couldn\u2019t recall previously having a conversation with Wood. Still, McCain took Wood\u2019s word for it when Wood vouched for Steele\u2019s credibility. \u201cSteele was a respected professional, Wood assured us, who had good Russian contacts and long experience collecting and analyzing intelligence on the Kremlin,\u201d McCain wrote. Present at the meeting with Wood and McCain was Kramer, who McCain writes agreed to \u201cgo to London to meet Steele, confirm his credibility and report back to me.\u201d McCain doesn\u2019t detail Kramer\u2019s visit to London beyond simply writing, \u201cWhen David returned, and shared his impression that the former spy was, as Sir Andrew had vouched, a respected professional, and not to outward appearances given to hyperbole or hysteria, I agreed to receive a copy of what is now referred to as \u2018the dossier.\u2019\u2019\u2019 McCain leaves out exactly where Kramer obtained his dossier copy. The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported last February that Kramer received the dossier directly from Fusion GPS after McCain expressed interest in it. Those details marked the clearest indication that McCain may have known that the dossier originated with Fusion GPS, meaning that he may have knowingly passed on political material to the FBI. Also, in a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0oped\u00a0in January, GPS co-founders Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritch wrote that they helped McCain share their anti-Trump dossier with the Obama-era intelligence community via an unnamed \u201cemissary.\u201d In his own testimony, Kramer relates conversations with Simpson about the dossier.

McCain continued, \u201cIf we don\u2019t do that, frankly\u2026 I see further polarization of the Hispanic voter and the demographics are clear that the Republican Party cannot win a national election. That\u2019s just a fact.\u201d ",

      "subtitle": "Senator John McCain agreed after being diagnosed with brain cancer, to give HBO special access for a documentary on his life.\u00a0Work has now begun on the television film, HBO announced on Monday.",
      "author": "Michelle Moons",
      "content": "  Six-time Emmy award-winner Peter Kunhardt is set to produce and direct the documentary and is working with his Emmy-winning sons George and Teddy Kunhardt, according to Deadline.com. The film, as of press time, is untitled and no premiere date has been set. Filmmakers are being given an exclusive look into McCain\u2019s life both in Washington, D.C. and back home in Sedona, Arizona. The report listed family, friends, and political figures as those who will appear in interviews for the film. McCain was diagnosed with a brain tumor, a glioblastoma last year. News broke of the tumor and its removal last July. HBO revealed that McCain agreed to the documentary shortly after the diagnosis. He has been resting at his home in Arizona for months while still holding his Senate seat and directing other Senators back in Washington. On Tuesday, McCain\u2019s office revealed that he underwent surgery for an intestinal infection at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. Filmmaker Peter Kunhardt described McCain as an \u201cAmerican hero\u201d and an example of \u201cwhat government can and should look like.\u201d McCain has spent over three decades in Washington, D.C. between the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and was the GOP Presidential nominee in 2008 alongside running mate and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. His personal account of his time as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam was printed in U.S. News and World Report in May 1973. The longtime elected Republican official from Arizona has faced criticism over his record in office. He has maintained close relationships with officials on the other side of the aisle and repeatedly involved himself in foreign affairs. One of his most recent votes created upheaval when he walked down the Senate floor and gestured a disapproving thumbs-down vote against a \u201cskinny\u201d version of Obama-care repeal and huddled up with Democrats on the Senate floor. McCain\u2019s was the deciding vote to kill the bill. The upcoming film will also feature home movies and photographs that have never been seen publicly before. Based on comments from the filmmakers, the documentary is likely to provide a favorable view of the controversial figure. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana",
