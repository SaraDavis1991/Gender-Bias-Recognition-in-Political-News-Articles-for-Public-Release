      "content": " Friday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe 11th Hour,\u201d liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore said he was all for Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) being the face of the Democratic Party, a suggestion President Donald Trump has made in recent weeks. The foursome known as \u201cThe Squad\u201d representing the Democrats\u2019 brand is how they win according to Moore. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that Alexandria and Rashida and Ilhan and Congresswoman Pressley are the face because that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to win,\u201d Moore said to host Brian Williams. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win with people who believe that climate change is real. We\u2019re going to win by getting behind people who want to raise the minimum wage, who are going to fight for all these things that the American public wants. That\u2019s \u2018The Squad.\u2019 They\u2019re the force out there.\u201d Moore offered a lengthy explanation about of history repeating itself in an effort to bolster that case. \u201cWell, first of all, Michigan has a long history, as does Wisconsin and Minnesota, the upper Midwest, of what you would call socialism or Democratic socialism or farm labor Democratic Party. We\u2019ve never trusted the banks or the large corporations. General Motors was founded in Flint, Michigan, in 1908. A year of General Motors trying to turn this into a company town, people were so upset at it, in the next election. Flint elected a socialist mayor to remove the pro-G.M. mayor when the corporation first began. So that\u2019s who we are. And the 13th district that Rashida Tlaib represents also has a strong history of \u2014 sadly right now it\u2019s the third poorest congressional district in the country.\u201d \u201cBut it also has another history,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe congressman back in 1972 \u2014 I remember this. I was a senior in high school. Charles Diggs was his name. He\u2019s one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. He represented Rashida Tlaib\u2019s district in the \u201970s. And he wanted to go and see the situation in South Africa. And the South African government would not give him a visa, and they banned him from visiting the country. So all these years later to have our congresswoman from the 13th district in Detroit facing a similar thing, what is it that they\u2019re afraid that they\u2019re going to see? What is it that \u2014 what doesn\u2019t the Israeli government \u2014 I mean I watched earlier Ali Velshi had on one the refused things, one of the Israeli army veterans. And he said, I was going to be her guide through Hebron, and I was going to take her down the main street of Hebron, where it\u2019s now vacant. All the shops are gone. The Israeli army calls it a sterile street. That\u2019s what he said right on this network, a sterile street because there are no Arabs around. Our members of Congress need to see that, and that\u2019s what unfortunately they\u2019re not going to be able to.\u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",

      "content": " The left side of her conference, run by the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d of socialist Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) is ascendant as Pelosi\u2019s top deputies\u2013several committee chairs\u2013face primary challenges similar to one Ocasio-Cortez used to wipe out longtime Pelosi ally, former Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-NY) on her path to power. In fact, at least seven of Pelosi\u2019s top confidantes\u2013committee chairs\u2013potentiallly face the same fate as Crowley, as primary challengers have announced campaigns against them. One powerful Pelosi deputy who faces a primary, Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY)\u2013the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee\u2013has not faced an internal party challenge since 1988. Roll Call\u2019s Jennifer Schutt wrote on Monday: The year was 1988. Def Leppard topped the charts and stonewashed jeans were all the rage. It was also the last time powerful House Appropriations Chairwoman\u00a0Nita M. Lowey\u00a0faced a primary challenge. That\u2019s all changed now with the decision by Mondaire Jones, a former Obama administration Justice Department staffer and attorney for Westchester County\u2019s Law Department, to challenge Lowey in next June\u2019s primary. The 32-year-old political novice plans to take on the New York Democratic incumbent over her positions on issues ranging from climate change to student debt forgiveness to oversight of the Trump administration. Schutt continued her piece by quoting Jones, who compared the race against Lowey to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory over another Pelosi confidante: Jones hopes the same sentiment that propelled young progressives to victory in the last election cycle \u2014 with Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s defeat of longtime New York Democrat\u00a0Joseph Crowley\u00a0the most famous example \u2014 will resonate with voters throughout New York\u2019s Rockland and Westchester counties. \u201cThe conventional wisdom dictated that people like me \u2014 young people, people of color \u2014 had to wait their turn, that they had to accept the opportunities that were given to them instead of putting themselves out there and letting the voters decide,\u201d Jones said in an interview. While Lowey has her hands full fighting off the primary challenge back home, she is hardly the only one of Pelosi\u2019s close allies\u2013members of Congress do not become committee chairs unless they are loyal foot soldiers for the Speaker\u2019s agenda\u2013under fire from the left facing primary challenges in their districts. Schutt continued her piece by noting several other committee chairs in Pelosi\u2019s majority are facing primaries too. Schutt wrote: Lowey arrived on Capitol Hill after the 1988 elections alongside Ways and Means Chairman\u00a0Richard E. Neal\u00a0of Massachusetts; Foreign Affairs Chairman\u00a0Eliot L. Engel\u00a0of New York; and Energy and Commerce Chairman\u00a0Frank Pallone Jr.\u00a0of New Jersey, who took office in late 1988 after a special election. All are facing primary challengers this year. The same goes for Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman\u00a0Peter A. DeFazio\u00a0of Oregon, first elected in 1986; Agriculture Chairman\u00a0Collin C. Peterson\u00a0of Minnesota, first elected in 1990; and even Judiciary Chairman\u00a0Jerrold Nadler\u00a0of New York, the party\u2019s point man on impeachment proceedings, who came to Congress after a 1992 special election.\u201d If even one of these seven committee chairs falls to a primary challenger, it would be cataclysmic in official Washington. People this close to the power of a House Speaker are theoretically supposed to be safe from such things, at least in their own parties, but with the rise of the anti-establishment left inside the Democrat conference\u2013led by the \u201cSquad\u201d but followed by many others, including in particular the broader Congressional Progressive Caucus\u2013the leadership has been caught off guard by surging leftist activism pushing political and policy priorities far outside the American mainstream. The swift takeover of the Democrat Party that Ocasio-Cortez and her comrades have engineered may have deep consequences for the party nationally. President Donald Trump has sought to accelerate her rise inside the Democrat Party, to great success, in order to force the party further to the left and away from solutions on issues voters care about like healthcare, infrastructure, immigration, family leave, the economy, and more. Instead, Democrats are now consumed with an agenda filled with antisemitic hatred of Israel, as well as open borders and anti-immigration enforcement sentiments; support for a government takeover of healthcare that even 2020 hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders admits would eliminate union health plans; higher taxation; a climate and environmental policy that would destroy American energy production, and many more extreme agenda items. It\u2019s happening in Congress, but also in the 2020 Democrat presidential primary field, where in debates even former Vice President Joe Biden has taken positions even Barack Obama would not take as president, such as providing government-funded healthcare plans to illegal aliens.   Having these primaries looming over these top Pelosi allies\u2019 heads like the Sword of Damocles for the next year will make it next to impossible for Democrats to come to the table with Trump and Senate Republicans on any meaningful issues. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy made the point in a Breitbart News hourlong radio exclusive earlier this month that Democrats have already failed to accomplish anything since taking the majority. \u201cLook at what the policies this new socialist Democrat party is doing,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThey want to one, their first most important bill\u2014when you become the majority, you reserve the first ten numbers for your most important bills\u2014so their most important bill, H.R. 1, was to take your taxpayer money and give it to their campaigns. Literally, tax the American public and give them thousands of dollars for their own campaigns. Then they have what is called Medicare for None. Medicare for None would take 180 million people\u2019s healthcare away while at the same time bankrupt those who are currently on Medicare. It\u2019s more government control. That\u2019s what I really believe this future election will be about: Socialism versus freedom. Control versus freedom. They just want greater control over our lives.\u201d But with Trump and Senate Republicans standing in the way of these newly radicalized Democrats controlling the House majority, their agenda is unlikely to ever make it into federal law.\u00a0That prospect of continued House Democrat failure to govern has Republicans salivating, as Democrats\u2019 more moderate members\u2013the ones they needed to win in 2018 to take the majority\u2013are being hung out to dry by the leftist flank of the party. \u201cThere are 31 seats that Democrats sit in today that President Trump carried,\u201d McCarthy said in his Breitbart News radio special earlier this month. \u201cOf those 31, 13 of them President Trump carried by more than six points. So, here you have the socialist wing of the party trying to take them further left, when the only way they have the majority is actually winning in Republican areas\u2014areas that would be swing districts.\u201d Pelosi spent part of earlier this year squabbling with members of the \u201cSquad,\u201d only to later come to their rescue, putting them in the driver\u2019s seat in terms of what gets on the House floor and what does not and setting the agenda for not just the Democrat conference but the whole national Democrat Party as well. Now, it turns out, she may not have any choice but to stick with the \u201cSquad\u201d moving forward as her own deputies are under fire. Whispers of Democrat primary challenges against \u201cSquad\u201d members have faded away, but Pelosi\u2019s own friends are in danger\u2013and she may not be able to rescue them.",

A month-long discussion has since been closed in support of having the facilities listed on the page based on Democrats including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez using the terminology.",
      "author": "T.D. Adler",
      "content": " Under Wikipedia policies, another month-long discussion will likely be required before the section can be removed again. In the discussion, editors supported inclusion by citing Democrats using the \u201cconcentration camp\u201d label, which has been recently invoked by the perpetrators of several violent attacks. During the controversy over President Trump\u2019s zero tolerance immigration policy last year, which left-wing critics derided as a \u201cfamily separation policy\u201d, an unregistered user added a section to the page about ICE facilities and this was expanded by another unregistered user. Media coverage in Gizmodo, Vice, and Marie Claire, generally favored the listing and presented it as fact. The media attention led to an \u201cedit war\u201d as editors removed and restored the section, until it was kept out barring a \u201cconsensus\u201d in favor of including the section and the page locked. The debate was re-ignited in mid-June after an unregistered user from the D.C. area restored the section stating \u201cthey\u2019re concentration camps\u201d without further explanation. On the same day Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) had begun pushing the term to describe the detention facilities. As with the previous versions last year, the sources cited in every version of the section often did not reference concentration or internment camps, including when making claims of health violations and deaths in the facilities. This would appear to violate Wikipedia\u2019s sourcing policies. Editors removed the section a few days after it was first added and a new edit war started as various editors began repeatedly removing or restoring the section until administrator \u201cEl C\u201d used his advanced privileges to lock the page with the section included. Responding to the fight over the listing, one participant claimed \u201cconsensus\u201d for including the section citing the few editors restoring the section and argued removal violated page restrictions, which required consensus for restoring new changes. When another editor disputed this \u201cconsensus\u201d claim, El C declared the section was the \u201clong-standing text\u201d despite only being added two weeks earlier after a year-long absence. In the same remarks he called the detention facilities \u201ccamps\u201d and suggested any discussion should presume inclusion by asking for removal instead. While presenting himself as a neutral arbiter, the administrator\u2019s profile page favorably displays a quote and image of late Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin. In subsequent discussion on removing ICE detention facilities from the concentration camp list, several left-wing editors cited reports of Representative Cortez using the label as supporting inclusion of ICE facilities on the list. Others cited what was claimed to be a statement from \u201c400 Holocaust and genocide\u201d experts on the subject in support, but one editor noted many were not actually experts in the field and they only permitted using the term. The editor further noted there was no scholarly consensus calling ICE detention facilities concentration camps and that the label was criticized by several Holocaust museums. Despite these points and other arguments that sources did not support listing ICE facilities as concentration or internment camps, the almost evenly-split discussion was closed by administrator Sam Walton as having consensus for keeping the section. In reaching his decision, Walton suggested objections to listing ICE facilities as concentration camp were \u201cnot based in policy\u201d claiming many were either mere disagreement without explanation or simply dismissing reliable sourcing as political rather than presenting more substantive critique. His only acknowledgment of legitimate concerns involved the list intro stating \u201crefugee camps\u201d were not included, which he suggested should be changed to accommodate mentioning ICE facilities, and such a change was implemented. Due to this decision, any attempt to remove the ICE facilities from the concentration camp list will likely now require a similar discussion to be initiated before it can be approved, leaving the \u201cconcentration camp\u201d label intact on Wikipedia for the foreseeable future. Rhetoric labeling immigration detention facilities as \u201cconcentration camps\u201d was recently used by Antifa terrorist Willem van Spronsen who was killed while attacking an ICE facility. This rhetoric was echoed by Antifa supporters on Wikipedia who censored mention of Spronsen\u2019s attack and the Antifa attack on journalist Andy Ngo from the far-left group\u2019s Wikipedia page. One socialist editor even praised Spronsen\u2019s attack. Similar praise came from Dayton shooter Connor Betts, whose Twitter activity was deeply immersed in the far-left\u2019s celebration of violence, including attacking ICE and even sharing a dox list of officers. Left-wing attacks on ICE have included threats against officers and contractors. Wikipedia\u2019s history of left-wing bias has previously involved pushing inflammatory attacks on Trump and protecting the left\u2019s own divisive rhetoric.

      "subtitle": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) released his plans for a Green New Deal, accompanied by a monstrous $16 trillion price tag.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Sanders calls climate change the\u00a0\u201csingle greatest challenge facing our country,\u201d citing\u00a0\u201cextreme\u201d weather phenomena like floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes, despite the fact that those occurrences have existed since the beginning of time. Sanders even suggests that climate change has a racial element to it, arguing the effects of climate change affect \u201ccommunities of color,\u201d particularly. He warns \u201cimmediate\u201d action is necessary, likening the \u201ccrisis\u201d to the challenges former President Franklin D. Roosevelt faced in the 1940s, leading to the creation of the New Deal. Sanders\u2019 plan promises to effectively reverse the \u201ccrisis\u201d while simultaneously creating 20 million jobs and reaching\u00a0\u201c100 percent renewable energy for electricity and transportation by no later than 2030 and complete decarbonization by at least 2050,\u201d per the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s guidelines. A $16.3 trillion public investment is necessary to make those goals a reality, which falls in line with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who said any viable climate change plan needed to come with a $10 trillion price tag \u2013 at least\u2013 in order to \u201chave a shot.\u201d Sanders says we must \u201cdirectly invest a historic $16.3 trillion public investment toward these efforts, in line with the mobilization of resources made during the New Deal and WWII, but with an explicit choice to include black, indigenous and other minority communities who were systematically excluded in the past.\u201d However, he claims the investment will effectively \u201cpay for itself\u201d over 15 years and that the price of inaction will cost far more, citing experts who say that doing nothing will cost the U.S.\u00a0\u201c$34.5 trillion in economic activity\u201d by 2100. He plans to pay for the $16.3 trillion plan with additional taxes on the fossil\u00a0fuel industry, and he plans to \u201cprosecute and sue\u201d them for the damage ravaged on the planet. Sanders\u2019 exhaustive plan covers virtually every angle of the climate change \u201ccrisis,\u201d from promising to \u201cfully electrify and decarbonize\u201d the transportation sector, to investing $1.12 billion in \u201ctribal land access and extension programs,\u201d to providing \u201coral translation assistance to USDA, FDA, and DOJ offices for non-English speaking farmers,\u201d to pouring $200 billion in the Green Climate Fund: Despite the major shortcomings of the Paris Climate Agreement, one primary reason why the globe was able to come together to sign the Paris Climate Agreement was that major developed nations like the United States finally recognized that they had an outsized role in the creation of the climate crisis, and an outsized obligation to less industrialized nations to help them achieve the same kind of carbon pollution emissions reductions while improving the quality of life in those countries. In order to help countries of the global south with climate adaptation efforts, the U .S . will invest $ 200 billion in the Green Climate Fund for the equitable transfer of renewable technologies, climate adaptation, and assistance in adopting sustainable energies. U.S. leadership can ensure that the developing world secures reliable electricity, reduces poverty and pollution-related fatalities, creates greater net employment, and improves living standards all while reducing greenhouse- gas emissions. Sanders also uses his plan as a pitch to drastically expand existing entitlement programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the\u00a0Low -Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The plan states in part: Energy assistance. While we do not expect energy prices to spike because the federal government is going to weatherize homes, electrify heating, and keep electricity prices stable, we still want to ensure that families are protected during the transition. We will expand the Low -Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) by $ 25 billion to help low-income families pay their heating and cooling bills. Additionally, the program will be expanded to provide 10 percent of program costs for maintenance of new efficient heating and cooling systems and technical assistance for the installation and use of new furnaces, heat pumps, boilers, and other upgrades for the duration of the 10-year transition. Ensure a hunger- free transition. Because the cost of energy and food are so intertwined, we will provide $ 215 . 8 billion for free, universal school meals, including breakfast, lunch and snacks. We will expand the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by $311billion to increase the benefits from the \u201d thrifty plan which provides inadequate benefits to the more generous low-cost food plan, include those with incomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty line, remove punitive work requirements, remove barriers for college students to access SNAP , and ensure are not denied benefits due to past interaction with the criminal justice system . We will also expand the SNAP program and benefits to the people of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa so they are on par with the benefits in the continental United States. \u201cWe need a president who has the courage, the vision, and the record to face down the greed of fossil fuel executives and the billionaire class who stand in the way of climate action,\u201d his plan states. \u201cWe need a president who welcomes their hatred. Bernie will lead our country to enact the Green New Deal and bring the world together to defeat the existential threat of climate change,\u201d it continues. The release of Sanders\u2019 plan comes on the heels of Gov. Jay Inslee\u2019s (D) departure from the presidential race. Inslee was the only candidate to build his entire campaign on the sole issue of climate change. \u201cI have seven grandchildren, and I\u2019m going to be damned if I\u2019m going to leave them a planet that is unhealthy and uninhabitable,\u201d Sanders told the New York Times.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " While Ocasio-Cortez has been relatively silent on social media over the past week, she made waves after posting a video on Instagram Monday, mocking the Electoral College, and by consequence, Middle America\u2019s voice. \u201cAlright everyone it\u2019s been a minute. We\u2019re coming to you live from the Electoral College,\u201d she said as her video panned to empty plainlands. \u201cMany votes here, as you can see. Very efficient way to choose leadership of the country. I mean, I can\u2019t think of any other way. Can you?\u201d she asked:  She followed her video with an article from the Intelligencer, which supposedly debunks the need for the Electoral College. \u201cTo all the Republicans getting big mad bc the electoral college is, in fact, a scam,\u201d she wrote, referring to an article titled \u201cHere\u2019s Every Defense of the Electoral College \u2014 and Why They\u2019re All Wrong.\u201d The backlash was swift, but the freshman lawmaker doubled down Friday. \u201cI see Fox News is big mad about abolishing the electoral college,\u201d she began, listing off reasons she believes it is outdated and nonsensical. One of the reasons the GOP opposes abolishing the age-old system, Ocasio-Cortez suggested, is because it \u201cknows\u201d it is not the majority:    Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s assessment, of course, is patently false. As Breitbart News explained: The Founding Fathers designed the Electoral College as a safeguard against mob rule, essentially preventing high population areas \u2014 such as the modern day Northeast Coast and California West Coast \u2014 from determining the outcome of presidential elections. It gives flyover America a proportional voice in choosing the leader of the nation \u2014 something critics, such as Ocasio-Cortez, seem to overlook. \u201cIt will be Los Angeles and New York, Malibu and Manhattan, that will have a disproportionate amount of voice in these elections,\u201d Turning Point USA\u2019s Charlie Kirk told Breitbart News at the Young Women\u2019s Leadership Summit in Dallas, Texas, in June. \u201cWhat makes the Electoral College so brilliant and so amazing is that it forces candidates to go to a diverse range of states,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen you have the Electoral College, it really forces broad-based coalition buildings,\u201d Kirk added. \u201cImagine, if you had a national popular vote, it\u2019s not as if there will be only two candidates; it will become highly fractionalized.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s initial rant prompted Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) to blast the freshman lawmaker, reminding her that the elimination of the Electoral College would silence voters in her state, Iowa. \u201cActually @AOC, eliminating the Electoral College would silence our voices here in Iowa and in many other states across the country,\u201d Ernst wrote. \u201cThis is just more evidence of how out of touch the Democrats have become\u201d: ",

      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " On Friday, Ocasio-Cortez posted the following 5-point missive on Twitter:    Last week, the socialist lawmaker claimed the Electoral College \u201cis, in fact, a scam\u201d and has a \u201cracial injustice breakdown.\u201d She wrote: \u201cThe Electoral College has a racial injustice breakdown. Due to severe racial disparities in certain states, the Electoral College effectively weighs white voters over voters of color, as opposed to a \u201cone person, one vote\u201d system where all our votes are counted equally.\u201d After her earlier remarks, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst pointed out that eliminating the Electoral College would shift the dynamic of power toward larger states such as New York, where Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s district is located, while silencing smaller states.  In recent years, abolishing the Electoral College has become a priority for the so-called progressive leadership. There is also a movement titled the National Popular Vote, or NPV, which would guarantee the presidency to the winner of the popular vote without ratifying the Constitution and without the full agreement of every state. The movement\u2019s website explains: The U.S. Constitution (Article II, Section 1) gives the states exclusive control over awarding their electoral votes: \u201cEach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors\u2026.\u201d The winner-take-all rule was used by only three states in 1789. The National Popular Vote interstate compact would not take effect until enacted by states possessing a majority of the electoral votes\u2014that is, enough to elect a President (270 of 538). Under the compact, the winner would be the candidate who received the most popular votes from all 50 states (and DC) on Election Day. When the Electoral College meets in mid-December, the national popular vote winner would receive all of the electoral votes of the enacting states. I previously reported on the NPV scheme: The NPV campaign seeks to obtain the consent of the majority of the 538 votes in the Electoral College to award electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote instead of the winner of the popular vote in each state. Aside from New York, other states that already signed up are the heavily blue states of Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Washington, Vermont, California and Rhode Island. The District of Columbia also has joined the pact. The states will not be required to award their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner until the NPV has signed up enough states to garner 270 electoral votes. \u2026The Founding Fathers firmly rejected a purely popular vote to elect the president, because they wanted to balance the power of the larger and smaller states. The Electoral College was fashioned as a compromise between an election of the president by direct popular vote and election by Congress. Now the NPV effort could change the way Americans elect the president without amending the U.S. Constitution. The plan simply requires that enough states join through votes in their legislatures along with gubernatorial approval. It takes two-thirds of both the House and Senate to pass a constitutional amendment to repeal the Electoral College. To bypass the constitutional amendment process, NPV minimizes the number of states that would need to agree. Instead, once enough states agree to allot its electoral votes to the national popular vote winner, the Electoral College becomes irrelevant.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Tlaib spoke to the Guardian following the drama that unfolded this month after Israel initially barred her from entering the country due to her ongoing support of the BDS movement. The Minnesota lawmaker reportedly wrote a letter addressed to\u00a0Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, begging to see her grandmother and promising to refrain from promoting boycotts against Israel during her trip. \u201cThis could be my last opportunity to see her. I will respect any restrictions and will not promote boycotts against Israel during my visit,\u201d she wrote. Deri granted her permission, but she refused to accept and told reporters at a news conference afterward that she cannot travel to Israel unless she is able to go as a \u201cfree American United States congresswoman.\u201d \u201cShe [Tlaib\u2019s grandmother] said I\u2019m her dream manifested, I\u2019m her free bird, so why would I come back and be caged and bow down when my election rose her head up high [and] gave her dignity for the first time,\u201d Tlaib stated through tears. Trump responded to Tlaib\u2019s presser, writing in part, \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t buy Rep. Tlaib\u2019s tears\u201d:  \u201cIt\u2019s been very clear to me, especially this last week, that he\u2019s scared of us,\u201d Tlaib told the Guardian. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of women of color \u2026 because we\u2019re not afraid of him and we\u2019re not afraid to speak up and say that we have a white supremacist in the White House who has a hate agenda,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid because we have a real agenda for the American people,\u201d she added, although it remains unclear what, exactly, that agenda entails, given the \u201cSquad\u201d members\u2019 propensity to veer from standard political issues, instead repeating talking points embraced by the \u201cwoke\u201d social justice warriors of the far-left. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), for instance, was under fire over the summer for continually comparing migrant detention centers to \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d While she has quieted down in recent weeks, she sparked another firestorm last week after lambasting the Electoral College and, as a consequence, rural voters. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), another prominent member of the so-called \u201cSquad,\u201d has been mired in controversy since her political inception, particularly for her history of antisemitic remarks.\u00a0Her remarks ultimately prompted the House to pass a resolution condemning \u201chate speech,\u201d although it did not specifically target Omar or her problematic comments. Both Tlaib and Omar came under fire earlier this month for sharing an antisemitic cartoon created by a participant of Iran\u2019s Holocaust denial contest. As Breitbart News reported: The cartoon Omar and Tlaib reportedly shared shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with his hand over Tlaib\u2019s mouth, and U.S. President Donald Trump with his hand over Omar\u2019s mouth. Both leaders are shushing the congresswomen. A Star of David \u2014 the symbol of the Jewish faith \u2014 appears in the center of the image, implying that Jews are responsible for the act of silencing. The fourth and perhaps lesser-known \u201cSquad\u201d member, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), is also no stranger to controversy. She came under fire for suggesting that black people, Muslims, and members of the LGBT community must all toe the progressive line. \u201cWe don\u2019t need black faces that don\u2019t want to be a black voice. We don\u2019t need Muslims that don\u2019t want to be a Muslim voice. We don\u2019t need queers that don\u2019t want to be a queer voice,\u201d she told the\u00a0Netroots Nation conference last month. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about being marginalized and stereotyped, please don\u2019t even show up because we need you to represent that voice,\u201d she added. President Trump has made a point to demonstrate that the far-left members of the \u201cSquad\u201d are driving the narrative of the Democrat party\u2013 something that has made moderates, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), uncomfortable. \u201cHe can bring it,\u201d Tlaib said of Trump. \u201cBecause we actually have policies that came from the people.\u201d \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing by choosing us four as his target is trying to distract folks from the fact that more people are living in poverty than ever, because he has failed as a president,\u201d she added.",

Unlike some Democrat candidates who have said that time is running out to fix the climate change problem, Yang said its too late. He wrote: The right time to deal with this crisis was decades ago. We\u2019ve waited too long, so we need to act fast and recognize that all options need to be on the table in order to adapt to the changed world we live in while mitigating behaviors that make it worse and reversing the damage we\u2019ve already done. To that end, Yang doubled down on his call to move people to higher ground as part of his \u2018\u201cfive-pronged approach\u201d to fighting climate change. \u201cMove our people to higher ground,\u201d Yang wrote. \u201cNatural disasters and other effects of climate change are already causing damage and death.

I\u2019m trying to have a nice life.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told viewers the same question keeps her up at night. It, quite literally, woke her up during her vacation, she claimed. \u201cEven while I was on vacation I woke up in the middle of the night at 3:30 in the morning just concerned about climate change,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told viewers: Last night on Instagram live while @AOC was making some boxed mac and cheese, she told a sob story about how she \u201cwoke up in the middle of the night while on vacation at 3:30 in the morning\u201d because she was so worried about climate change\u2026 Raise your hand if you call bullshit! pic.twitter.com/B6mNvah8YT \u2014 That Trump Guy \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@ThatTrumpGuy) August 28, 2019  She also told viewers how the climate change \u201ccrisis\u201d is affecting her long-term family planning. She said she has always wanted to adopt children but added that she wants to have one less child due to environmental concerns. \u201cEven now, you know when you put climate change on top of that, I know that I want to perhaps have one less child than I thought I would maybe have,\u201d the freshman Democrat said, adding \u201colder generations\u201d do not understand how much climate change impacts the decisions of the younger generation. \u201cI think having a mixed family is part of my personal planning. But it\u2019s really hard, and I don\u2019t think sometimes that older generations understand how much we\u2019re taking this into account,\u201d she continued: On Instagram live just now, AOC says she's going to have one less child because of climate change. pic.twitter.com/qUess81XPi \u2014 Caleb Hull (@CalebJHull) August 28, 2019  The \u201cSquad\u201d ringleader took her remarks on older generations a step further after a viewer asked if she believed younger generations were too \u201cdelicate.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez passionately disagreed with that assessment, calling younger generations \u201cbadass\u201d and proceeding to insult older generations to build her case. \u201cI think young people are more informed and dynamic than their predecessors. I think that they are more sensitive in a positive way in that they actually care about other people\u2019s experiences and lives,\u201d she said, praising what she calls the younger generation\u2019s \u201cradical acceptance.\u201d She continued: They actually take time to read and understand our history. The history of the labor movement, history of civil rights, history of racial struggles, history of economics, history of the United States, history of colonialism. And they\u2019re not afraid to have those conversations. \u201cIf anything, I think they\u2019re profoundly courageous because they\u2019re willing to puncture taboos and have conversations that frankly older generations sometimes struggle to have,\u201d she said. \u201cNot everyone. I don\u2019t want to paint everybody with a broad brush,\u201d she added, before proceeding to paint older generations with a broad brush. \u201cI think this new generation is very profound and very strong and very brave because they\u2019re actually willing to go to the streets. How about that?\u201d she said. \u201cPrevious generations have just assumed that government\u2019s got it. Let me tell you something. You are the government. Like, as a democracy, \u2018We the People\u2019 means you,\u201d she added: AOC on Instagram live: \u201cYoung people are more informed and dynamic than their predecessors\u2026 they actually take time to read and understand our [world] history.\u201d Um, what? pic.twitter.com/hk1ZHpUSOv \u2014 Caleb Hull (@CalebJHull) August 28, 2019 ",

So we need to bite the bullet on the cost because the alternative to not spending the money is A.) Death and B.) Spending even more money,\u201d she concluded:  Ocasio-Cortez retweeted the video, seemingly happy with it, arguing it helps \u201cspread & explain our policy positions.\u201d \u201cI love everything about this GOP attack ad. Republicans underestimate my intelligence bc I invite people into my home & talk about policy in plain English instead of DC jargon,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey think that\u2019s dumb, so they end up paying for ads that spread & explain our policy positions,\u201d she added:  It remains unclear which of the far-left\u2019s policy positions would reduce the temperature of the sun. However, socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) unveiled massive plans for a $16 trillion Green New Deal last week, which focuses heavily on expanding existing entitlement programs and creating millions of \u201cclean energy\u201d jobs. Ocasio-Cortez recently told her followers that climate change concerns wake her up in the middle of the night and added that she wants to \u201cperhaps have one less child\u201d due to the festering \u201ccrisis.\u201d",

I am thrilled to announce the launch of our #GreenNewDeal art series with custom Bronx & Queens GND posters,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote in one tweet.  \u201cThe Bronx edition poster will be given for free as a limited release to the public at our Pelham Bay Nature Day & Backpack Giveaway in the Bronx tomorrow,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told her followers. \u201cThese posters push us to imagine our future with a Green New Deal in two of our beloved NY-14 parks: Pelham Bay & Flushing Meadows,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez continued in a separate tweet. She went on to add that the posters will \u201cbe available for purchase soon\u201d and are made in America. Ocasio-Cortez also stated that she is \u201cworking on a line of GND reusables.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said the posters were inspired by the \u201coriginal New Deal\u201d and compared her poster alongside that of a 1939 Federal Art Project\u00a0poster showing Wyoming\u2019s Jenny Lake located in Grand Teton National Park. \u201cOur #GreenNewDeal posters are inspired by the original New Deal, updated for our future,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said.  \u201cDuring the New Deal, FDR launched Federal One, a US project that employed 5,300 artists that created & taught art to envision America\u2019s future,\u201d Ocasio Cortez added. Earlier this week, Ocasio-Cortez claimed she wants to have \u201cone less child\u201d due to her climate concerns, saying she \u201cwoke up in the middle of the night at 3:30 in the morning just concerned about climate change\u201d while on vacation.

On Friday, Breitbart News reported that a group called\u00a0Super Happy Fun America organized the parade that was held over the weekend in response to gay pride parades that take place each year in cities all over the nation. Critics of the group said the organizers are \u201cwhite-supremacists\u201d who intend to bait members of the LGBTQ community, according to the report. However, the president of the organization, John Hugo, said, \u201cThere are no racists in our group.

On Saturday, Breitbart News reported that many of the parade\u2019s attendees, who are also Trump supporters, met with pushback from counter-demonstrators who reportedly consider them to be \u201chomophobic extremists.\u201d \u201cAs the hundreds-strong processions ended outside City Hall in one of America\u2019s most liberal cities, people from the two camps stood close enough to yell in each other\u2019s faces and in a few instances threw coffee cups and soil at each other.

President Trump did not implement a blanket Muslim ban. The freshman Democrat was referring to the effective restrictions of legal immigration from countries with documented issues of terrorism. The original list was based on a handful of countries previously flagged by the Obama administration, and it did not affect the vast majority of Muslim nations. Ocasio-Cortez has also come under fire for inaccurately describing migrant detention shelters as concentration camps. Holocaust survivors have taken issue with her assessment, specifically. Despite Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s assertion, there is no evidence of Trump or his administration using racism to \u201cdismantle public goods & civil rights.\u201d This is far from the first time Ocasio-Cortez has accused Trump, his supporters, allies, and the GOP of covertly using racism to advance bigoted policies or agendas. The New York lawmaker told Crooked Media\u2019s Pod Save America last month that many Trump supporters are simply not educated enough to understand that they are supporting racist policies. \u201cIt\u2019s not about asking are Trump voters racist. We need to talk about racism, not racists. Racist \u2014 it\u2019s a very two-dimensional, boring conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cIs something racist, yes or no.\u201d She said that Trump \u201crelied on a coalition\u201d full of racists, as well as \u201call sorts of other people that could be susceptible to racist views.\u201d \u201cSo there are a lot of people that support Trump that genuinely don\u2019t believe that they are racist because we do not talk about or educate people on recognizing racism,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because we do not do that we get caught in this debate of is something racist. Then people use their defensiveness, and they say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s not racist because I\u2019m not racist and I believe this thing because it\u2019s economic in nature,'\u201d she added.",

Many Democrats in Washington deride the president every day and hope to scare us with unfounded predictions of recession and making demands for policies and government regulations that would return us to the economic flatline of the Obama years.

While the first official hurricane warning in the U.S. did not\u00a0come\u00a0until 1873 and the U.S. did not actively begin naming hurricanes until the 1950s, the\u00a0meteorological events are not a new phenomenon. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) also released an aggressive climate change agenda ahead of CNN\u2019s climate change town hall, channeling Gov. Jay Inslee (D) and proposing a multitrillion-dollar plan designed to \u201cdecarbonize\u201d the economy and reach 100 percent clean energy over the next decade.

      "content": " \u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote alongside a clip of Warren from Wednesday evening\u2019s town hall. \u201cWe all want to, & can, do our part w climate change & environmental justice,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut know that just 3 industries are responsible for 71% of carbon emissions. & if you\u2019re concerned abt money in politics, the fossil fuel industry is a key source of political corruption,\u201d she added:  The clip features Warren fielding a question from Chris Cuomo, who asked, \u201cDo you think that the government should be in the business of telling you what kind of lightbulb you can have?\u201d \u201cOh, come on, give me a break,\u201d Warren said. \u201cNo. Here\u2019s the\u2013\u00a0 look, there are a lot of ways that we try to change our energy consumption, and our pollution, and God bless all of those ways,\u201d she said before listing off lightbulbs, plastic straw usage, and beef consumption. \u201cSome of it is with lightbulbs, some of it is on straws, some of it, dang, is on cheeseburgers, right?\u201d Warren asked. \u201cThere are a lot of different pieces to this.\u201d \u201cAnd I get that people are trying to find the part that they can work on and what can they do. And I\u2019m in favor of that. And I\u2019m going to help and I\u2019m going to support,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut understand, this is exactly what the fossil fuel industry hopes we\u2019re all talking about. That\u2019s what they want us to talk about,\u201d the presidential candidate added, referring to action on lightbulbs, plastic straws, and cheeseburgers. She continued: \u201cThis is your problem.\u201d They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around your lightbulbs, around your straws, and around your cheeseburgers. When 70 percent of the pollution of the carbon that we\u2019re throwing into the air comes from three industries, and we can set our targets and say, by 2028, 2030, and 2035, no more. Think about that. Right there. Now, the other 30 percent, we still got to work on. Oh, no, we don\u2019t stop at 70 percent. But the point is, that\u2019s where we need to focus. And why don\u2019t we focus there? It\u2019s corruption. It\u2019s these giant corporations that keep hiring the PR firms that \u2014 everybody has fun with it, right, gets it all out there \u2014 so we don\u2019t look at who\u2019s still making the big bucks off polluting our Earth. And the time for that has passed. We have a chance, a chance left in 2020 to turn this around, but we are running out of time on this one. So we\u2019ve got to do this in 2020, and that means the first thing we\u2019ve got to do is we\u2019ve got to attack this corruption head on in Washington and say enough of having the oil industry, the fossil fuel industry write all our laws in this area. No more. No more. Concerns surrounding big government measures on beef consumption and plastic straw usage have been spurred by remarks made by many of Warren\u2019s fellow contenders and not necessarily driven by the fossil fuel industry. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) admitted during the CNN town hall that she wants to \u201cencourage innovation\u201d and ultimately ban plastic straws, and many of the remaining candidates \u2013 including Andrew Yang (D), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) \u2013 signaled their openness to address meat consumption on various levels. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) told CNN\u2019s\u00a0Alisyn Camerota Thursday that people who use plastic straws and eat cheeseburgers are \u201cpart of the problem\u2019:  Last week, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) signaled that he is open to the possibility of a \u201cmeat tax\u201d:  Sanders also made waves Wednesday night after confirming that he is willing to address population control. \u201cWould you be courageous enough to discuss this issue and make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe?\u201d a town hall attendee asked. \u201cThe answer is yes,\u201d Sanders said, adding that the U.S. must do more to help women across the globe gain access to abortion: ",

      "content": " The Gathering Threat to the Electoral College\u2014and to the U.S. Senate The left has a hot new cause: getting rid of the Electoral College.\u00a0 And if the left succeeds in doing away with that venerable institution, its next target, the U.S. Senate, will fall like a dried apple. As is so often the case with leftist causes these days; the spearhead is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; being social-media-savvy and telegenic, she\u2019s the star of the progressive A-Team. Way back on October 6, 2018, AOC was tweeting: It is well past time we eliminate the Electoral College, a shadow of slavery\u2019s power on America today that undermines our nation as a democratic republic. Just on August 20, she ripped into the Electoral College again, calling it a \u201cscam\u2026 racial injustice,\u201d which \u201ceffectively weighs white voters over voters of color.\u201d\u00a0 What was needed instead, she continued, is a \u201cone person, one vote system,\u201d in which \u201call our votes are counted equally.\u201d\u00a0 AOC was pointing\u00a0to such possible \u201creforms\u201d as a national popular vote, which would do away with, of course, the Electoral College. Then, on August 23, she launched a further tweet-storm against the College: If the GOP were the \u201csilent majority\u201d they claim, they wouldn\u2019t be so scared of a popular vote.\u00a0 They *know* they aren\u2019t the majority.\u00a0 They rely on establishing minority rule for power. AOC concluded: The Electoral College isn\u2019t about fairness at all; it\u2019s about empowering some voters over others.\u00a0 Every vote should be = in America, no matter who you are or where you come from.\u00a0 The right thing to do is establish a Popular Vote. & GOP will do everything they can to fight it. In response, a few brave Republicans jumped into the social-media melee.\u00a0 On August 21, Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa tweeted, \u201cActually @AOC, eliminating the Electoral College would silence our voices here in Iowa and in many other states across the country.\u201d\u00a0 Ernst, who is up for re-election next year, then added a further dig: \u201cThis is just more evidence of how out of touch the Democrats have become.\u201d We might pause over Ernst\u2019s words: The Hawkeye State lawmaker is shrewdly juxtaposing \u201cour voices here in Iowa\u201d with \u201cout of touch\u201d Democrats.\u00a0 So we can see: Ernst is seeking to rally the interests of her small state (six electoral votes) against the views of AOC\u2019s big state (29 electoral votes). Since Ernst is running in Iowa, it\u2019s smart for her to stick up for Iowa.\u00a0 To be sure, New Yorkers see it differently\u2014but that\u2019s no surprise.\u00a0 What would be surprising is if anyone in Iowa thought it was in Iowa\u2019s best interest to bow down to New York. Two days later, Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas also tweeted back at AOC: Abolishing the Electoral College means that politicians will only campaign in (and listen to) urban areas.\u00a0 That is not a representative democracy.\u00a0 We live in a republic, which means 51% of the population doesn\u2019t get to boss around the other 49%. We can admire Crenshaw\u2019s stipulation that the U.S. is a \u201crepublic.\u201d He\u2019s quite right, of course, insofar as James Madison\u2019s Constitution explicitly lays out a formula for a mixed government, aimed at thwarting both tyranny and mob rule.\u00a0 (The nuances of such small \u201cr\u201d republicanism were once the staple of high-school civics classes\u2014that is, the \u201cold-fashioned\u201d education that lamentably disappeared amidst the newfangled quest for relevance and political correctness.) Yet in the meantime, unhindered by concerns about the Constitution, the anti-Electoral College juggernaut rolls on; other prominent Democrats have come out in support of its abolition, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Stacey Abrams, the woman who will never admit that she didn\u2019t win last year\u2019s Georgia gubernatorial election. Also, speaking for our friends in Hollywood, here\u2019s Barbra Streisand; she, or at least her ghost writer, adds her voice to the anti-Electoral College cause: The 14th\u00a0Amendment of our Constitution actualized what many of the Founders wanted, promoting equal protection under the law for all Americans.\u00a0 If I could, I would end the antiquated Electoral College.\u00a0 Twice in the last 20 years the popular vote winner was denied the presidency.\u00a0 This is an assault on our democratic principles, where the dictum should hold true: one person, one vote. It is, indeed, true that in 2000 and 2016, the Democrat presidential candidate won the popular vote and lost the Electoral College, thus losing the White House.\u00a0 Indeed, leading MSM observers \u2014 writing recently for NBC News and the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0\u2014 have argued that it could happen again in 2020. Yet if the Electoral College can sometimes go against the national-vote majority, what\u2019s the argument in favor of it?\u00a0 Why should we support the 18th-century Constitution in light of 21st century popular passions? Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute argues that the Electoral College is permanently valuable because it requires an actual majority to choose a president; it thus confers legitimacy on the victor.\u00a0 That\u2019s because the College includes a mechanism for a kind of runoff within the Congress, such that the eventual winner must gain a majority of Electoral Votes.\u00a0 This runoff feature is vital, because it eliminates the possibility that a fringe candidate could sneak through to victory with a mere plurality of the popular ballots cast. Perhaps even more importantly, it\u2019s also worth emphasizing that the Electoral College was central to our constitutional founding; it was the brilliant political compromise that enabled the forming of a robust union in the first place.\u00a0 You see, back in 1787, the small states, such as Delaware and Vermont, insisted on the College as the price for ratifying the Constitution and joining the union.\u00a0 To put that another way, if it were not for the Electoral College, there might never have been a United States.\u00a0 (As an aside, today, both Delaware and Vermont are strongly Democrat.) One group making a strong constitutional defense of the Electoral College is the American Legislative Exchange Council; ALEC, an assembly of state legislators from across the nation, argues: The Electoral College respects and protects states within our constitutional republic.\u00a0 It has balanced the interests of rural and urban states, requiring serious presidential candidates and political parties to attract support from a genuine cross-section of the American public, for the past 58 presidential elections. To put that another way, if we were to start revising the 230-year-old precedent of the Electoral College, we\u2019d be at risk of revising everything\u2014and not for the better. Moreover, we can add an important additional point: If we got rid of the Electoral College, we\u2019d also be getting rid of the U.S. Senate. Yes, the Electoral College and the Senate are linked because they follow related political formulas: Each state, no matter how big or small, gets two Senators, and an Electoral Vote for each Senator. It is, of course, true that voters in small states have more \u201cSenate power\u201d than voters in big states.\u00a0 These days, that\u2019s a boon to Democrat Vermont and Delaware, as well as to Republican Alaska and South Dakota. So if we ever were to change the College, the temptation to change the Senate, too, would be irresistible.\u00a0 That is, if AOC\u2019s logic on the College\u2014including notions of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d-type rearranging, as outlined in the 1962 Supreme Court case, Baker v. Carr, and since\u2014were embraced, then there\u2019s no reason why the same concept couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t be applied to the Senate. Needless to say, President Donald Trump is the top target of Democrats in 2020, and yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is up there, too, on the target list, and so are the Senators who compose his majority.\u00a0 So of course the Democrats want to deconstruct that majority. And if both the Electoral College and the Senate went away, what would happen next?\u00a0 One shudders to think, although Shakespeare vividly captured the feeling of foreboding: \u201cUntune that string, and, hark, what discord follows!\u201d So what to do?\u00a0 How to defend the Constitution and the good order it provides? \u00a0 Obviously, no amount of constitutional or political argumentation is going to change the minds of AOC & Co. Thus constitutionalists need a defensive strategy; they need to batten down the political hatches to be prepared for the storm that\u2019s coming. One preparation is to make sure that all small states are lined up to protect themselves against the AOC-type spiel; specifically, all elected officials from small states should be pledged to defend the Constitution as it is. And when we say \u201cpledged,\u201d we should mean, yes, an actual pledge.\u00a0 Or better yet, pledges\u2014pledges to defend the Electoral College and also, relatedly, to defend the U.S. Senate. Two Pledges to Defend the Constitution The first pledge is to defend the Electoral College.\u00a0 In a perfect world, every state would staunchly defend the Electoral College.\u00a0 And yet in this real world, many states won\u2019t, and so constitutionalists, readying their defensive works, might think first about bolstering the 13 smallest states (in order from the smallest: WY, VT, AK, ND, SD, DE, RI, MT, ME, NH, HA, ID, and WV). We can pick the number 13 for a forward-looking reason, not just because it has a nice 1776-ish resonance.\u00a0 That is, anticipating some future era of Democrat dominance, when Democrats might seek to rush through a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College, we can recall that 13 states are enough to block the ratification of such an amendment. After all, it takes three-fourths of the states\u201438 of the 50\u2014to ratify an amendment, so 13 states saying \u201cno\u201d are enough to block it. It\u2019s worth noting that these 13 states are hardly uniformly Republican.\u00a0 In the 2016 presidential election, eight of them voted Republican, while four voted Democrat (Maine used its quirky system to split its Electoral Votes). Yet all these states, regardless of partisanship, share an interest in preserving their constitutional rights.\u00a0 So the citizens of those states should insist on the safeguarding of these rights.\u00a0 And to simplify this safeguarding, a written pledge could be developed for politicians to sign.\u00a0 This constitutional pledge need not be complicated; here\u2019s some nice and concise language: I pledge to oppose any and all efforts to change or dilute the power of my state\u2019s Electoral Votes.\u00a0 I will also oppose any change or dilution of the Electoral College as a whole. That\u2019s simple enough. Of course, it could be hard for some small-state Democrats to sign and honor this pledge, because as we have seen, their national party, anchored in big states, is increasingly hostile to the Electoral College.\u00a0 Thus the Electoral College Pledge would put small-state Democrats\u2014especially those with national ambitions\u2014in a bind; they would have to choose: Stick with the state and anger the AOC-ized national party, or go along with the national party and risk the wrath of the state folks. Yes, the stakes are high.\u00a0 Small states that wish to defend their powers can\u2019t afford to let their elected officials mumble around on the fate of the Electoral College.\u00a0 As we know from other issues, many Democrats have proven themselves skilled at talking one way at home while voting another way in the capital.\u00a0 A pledge, putting it in writing, would cut down such flim-flammery. The Electoral College Pledge would thus be most useful for state legislators, and if incumbents are reluctant to sign, it could help their pro-pledge challengers. Moreover, the Electoral College Pledge could be extended to all of a state\u2019s office-holders, since their overall voice, if not their proximate vote, could affect the ratification process. Of course, we mustn\u2019t forget federal office-holders.\u00a0 They, too, can defend the Constitution, since any proposed amendment requires a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate. And speaking of the Senate\u2014so crucial to the power of small states\u2014we can turn, now, to the second pledge: I pledge to oppose any and all efforts to change or dilute the enumeration of my state\u2019s Senatorial delegation.\u00a0 Two is the right number, just as the Constitution states.\u00a0 I will also oppose any change or dilution of the U.S. Senate as a whole. Moreover, since the Electoral College is the first line of defense for the Senate, I reiterate my support for the maintenance and perpetuation of the Electoral College as it is currently established. We can see: This Senate Pledge also uses simple language, made only a bit more complicated insofar as it is connected to the Electoral College Pledge. We might note that in the case of these 13 states, their cumulative senatorial delegations are evenly split: 13 Republicans and 13 Democrats.\u00a0 (Technically, two Senators, from Maine and Vermont, are independents, and yet they align with the Democrats in all the ways that matter.) Yet whatever party a small-state lawmaker belongs to, he or she should be resolutely determined to defend small-state prerogatives\u2014right?\u00a0 After all, surely no small-stater would sell out his or her state to curry favor with the likes of AOC and the national Democrats\u2014right? As Ronald Reagan, that canny fellow, liked to say about murky situations, \u201cTrust, yet verify.\u201d\u00a0 So all citizens of these 13 states should humbly, but sternly, request that their lawmakers, state and federal alike, sign these two pledges. Moreover, beyond those 13 smallest states, there are plenty of other smallish states that have a similarly strong interest in maintaining the integrity of the Electoral College and of the Senate. One such smallish state is Joni Ernst\u2019s Iowa.\u00a0 As we saw earlier, Ernst is vigilant about her state\u2019s interests; indeed, the motto on the Iowa state flag reads, \u201cOur liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain.\u201d So now, as we move towards the 2020 election, it will be interesting to see if Ernst\u2019s Democrat challenger, whoever that turns out to be, is willing to stand up, in writing, for Iowa\u2019s liberties and rights.\u00a0 If not, then the voters, having been put on notice about the challenger\u2019s potential waywardness on a supreme issue, should vote in November 2020 to defend those liberties and rights. Through such constitution-minded political action, voters in each state can help preserve our Republic.",

As Breitbart News reported: The funds being used are from deferred military construction projects that are not scheduled for award until fiscal year 2020 or later and do not include any family housing, barracks, or dormitory projects. Approximately $1.8 billion of the funds will come from projects slated for outside the U.S., and the remaining $1.8 billion would come from projects slated for within the U.S. The funds for overseas projects will be prioritized for use first. Pentagon officials said during a press conference Tuesday that funding for 127 military construction projects would be delayed to build 175 miles of the border wall. The 11 projects include the replacement and new construction of border wall across El Paso and Laredo, Texas; Yuma, Arizona; and San Diego and El Centro, California. While proponents argue that the cause \u2014 border security \u2014 is essential and muse that some of the funds used are largely \u201cpork barrel money,\u201d Democrat critics adamantly disagree.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) \u2013\u00a0another significant Trump critic \u2013\u00a0said Trump\u2019s desire to build his \u201clittle wall\u201d is rooted in nothing but ego:  As Breitbart News reported, \u201cThe funds being used are from deferred military construction projects that are not scheduled for award until fiscal year 2020 or later and do not include any family housing, barracks, or dormitory projects.\u201d Pentagon officials confirmed that the projects would not be done away with altogether: Pentagon officials said during a press conference Tuesday that funding for 127 military construction projects would be delayed to build 175 miles of the border wall. The 11 projects include the replacement and new construction of border wall across El Paso and Laredo, Texas; Yuma, Arizona; and San Diego and El Centro, California. Many support the Trump administration\u2019s efforts. CNN spoke to a rancher who lives on the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, who said he does not mind the Trump administration diverting funds, as many of the projects are \u201cpork barrel money.\u201d \u201cMost of the money going to these projects is pork barrel money \u2014 it just isn\u2019t necessary. I am good with diverting that money,\u201d John Ladd said, according to CNN. \u201cThere is lots of waste in the military, especially on the bases. Fort Huachuca, they\u2019ve got everything they need. So divert the money to the border,\u201d he added. \u201cThis part of Arizona has long needed border security. That has never changed. This is the job of Congress,\u201d another rancher,\u00a0Peggy Davis, said. \u201cOnce again they are playing politics and not doing their job. From what I can determine the Fort Huachuca project is needed but not in the sense of life and death or housing.\u201d",

I think it\u2019s always been emoluments. It\u2019s always been about that for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI think two would be tax fraud,\u201d she continued, adding, \u201cI think emoluments kind of includes any misconduct, financial misconduct in relation to Russia\u201d:  Even though former Special Counsel Robert Mueller confirmed that there was no evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, Ocasio-Cortez insisted that Mueller was spelling out impeachment:  \u201cOpening an impeachment inquiry is exactly what we must do when the President obstructs justice, advises witnesses to ignore legal subpoenas, & more,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in June:  The House Judiciary Committee is reportedly laying the groundwork for its impeachment inquiry and is expected to vote on a resolution outlining the scope of the probe this week.",

      "subtitle": "Charlie Copeland, the President of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, told Breitbart News this week that conservative students shouldn\u2019t hide from their Liberal professors, because it can hinder their intellectual growth. At the same time, Copeland points out it is important to research professors to learn who the most extreme leftists are. 73 percent of Republican students report self-censoring in the classroom to avoid problems with professors according to a recent survey.",
      "author": "Tom Ciccotta",
      "content": " Charlie Copeland serves as the president of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI), which was first headed by a young William F. Buckley. The ISI, under Copeland\u2019s leadership, continues the tradition that Buckley started, uniting and educating right-minded students on American campuses around the country. Copeland spoke with Breitbart News this week in response to a survey that revealed that 73 percent of Republican students self-censor in the classroom to avoid repercussions at the hands of their leftist professors. Copeland argues that conservative students would be best served if they engage in a civil back-and-forth with their leftist professors. \u201cI do think that there are options. ISI has a network of faculty associates on 940 campuses across the country. It\u2019s about 37 percent of the college campuses out there. We know, through our own research internally and long history, that there are probably a couple of thousand faculty members out there that are conservative and we\u2019re working every day to try to identify them and build them into our network of associates,\u201d Copeland said. Copeland suggested that many leftists, including one freshman congresswoman, hinder their intellectual capacity by surrounding themselves only with those with whom they agree. \u201cAnd sometimes it\u2019s good to be in a class where, maybe, the professor does disagree with you, in a respectful back-and-forth kind of way. Because that helps sharpen your saw.\u00a0 If I just hang out with people that agree with me, then I end up like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, where I don\u2019t actually develop any intellectual depth because I never challenged myself,\u201d Copeland added. Copeland encourages right-leaning students to research professors before they enroll in their classes. \u201cIf you are on a campus and you don\u2019t know where to go and you don\u2019t have a professor that you can trust that you can reach out to, then I think the advice of \u2018just lay low, get your degree and get out in the real world and do your thing\u2019 makes a lot of sense,\u201d Copeland added. \u201cBut there are conservative faculty out there, and if you reach out to an organization like ISI and identified those professors and took classes with good professors and not lousy professors, then I think then you can get a better education than if you just keep your head down and try to avoid being outed.\u201d However, if a conservative student ends up in a course taught by an intolerant leftist professor, Copeland tells students that they have two options. \u201cIf you do end up in one of those classes, the chances are not small that you will, I do think that you have two options. The safe route is to say, \u2018I\u2019ve got to come here for the next 12 weeks. It\u2019s two times a week for an hour and fifteen minutes,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cSo I\u2019m just going to keep my head down and do the readings\u2026I\u2019ll be okay and I\u2019ll get out.\u2019 That\u2019s an absolutely safe way to go. Now, we have 60 student newspapers across the country, and some of these students are feisty students. And they want to have the argument.\u00a0 They want an open debate. For someone like that, I say, alright, put something in the paper that challenges the teacher.\u201d The ISI website includes information for students, faculty, and alumni on how they can help improve higher education in the United States.",

That should tell you everything you really need to know about the face of socialism, right now, in our country.\u201d WATCH:   Heng continued, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to ever threaten anybody \u2014 member of Congress or not \u2014 but it\u2019s so important to be able to have this discussion in our country about what true socialism is, and what it\u2019s done without being attacked through death threats [or] anything else.

It seems like every single time a conservative speaks up, the left consistently wants to ban them, censor then, boycott them.\u201d \u201cI want [Ocasio-Cortez] to have a voice,\u201d added Heng. \u201cI just don\u2019t agree with it, but I also would expect her and the radical left to respect my voice, too, so that we can have some discussion in this country.\u00a0The ideas she continues to push have actually killed people throughout the world. Those dead bodies that you see on there that some deem as provocative, they could very well have been some of my own family members.

      "content": " The freshman lawmaker tweeted a video of an impassioned 2018 speech she gave on sexual assault, accused Kavanaugh of lying under oath, and called for his impeachment. \u201cThis was almost a year ago. It is unsurprising that Kavanaugh, credibly accused of sexual assault, would lie under oath to secure a Supreme Court seat,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBecause sexual assault isn\u2019t a crime of passion \u2013 it\u2019s about the abuse of power. He must be impeached\u201d:  During the writing of this article, Ocasio-Cortez inexplicably deleted and re-posted this video \u2014 even though the basis for her claims have been all but retracted by the very paper that published them. Times\u00a0staffers Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly published a story over the weekend previewing their upcoming book The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation. The pair claims to have uncovered a \u201cpreviously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. [Deborah] Ramirez\u2019s allegation,\u201d accusing Kavanaugh of having his penis thrust into a female student\u2019s hand: We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. [Deborah] Ramirez\u2019s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. (We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier.) However, the Times failed to initially note that the alleged victim does not recall the alleged incident. The publication eventually added the following note: Editors\u2019 Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book\u2019s account regarding as assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports the female student declined to be interviewed and fr8iends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article. The individual who claimed to see Kavanaugh allegedly expose himself at the party, Max Stier, served as a Bill Clinton defense attorney during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He also refused to speak to the Times, as Breitbart News reported. Fellow \u201cSquad\u201d members \u2013\u00a0Reps.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Ocasio-Cortez backed Newman in a tweet on Tuesday:  It was Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s first endorsement of a primary challenger to an incumbent Democrat in the 2020 cycle. Lipinski, one of the few remaining pro-life Democrats, defeated the pro-choice Newman in a heated primary contest last year. Lipinski also voted against Obamacare in 2010. Newman also holds a number of other left-wing opinions. In a statement, Lipinski said that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement proved Newman is too \u201cextreme\u201d for the 3rd congressional district, and said voters \u201cdo not want to be represented by a fifth member of the \u2018Squad\u2019.\u201d  The \u201cSquad\u201d is a nickname Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) bestowed upon Ocasio-Cortez and Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), who tend to vote together and take far-left positions. Lipinski also criticized Newman for supporting the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan that left-wing Democrats have backed, arguing that it would take private health insurance away from 170 million people and double federal income taxes for the average family in his working-class district. Ocasio-Cortez responded by calling Lipinski\u2019s statement \u201cdivisive.\u201d Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "author": "Jerome Hudson",
      "content": " If you only read establishment media outlets, consumed progressive cable and network news, or trusted only Democratic and left-wing politicians, you\u2019d probably believe that the federal law enforcement agents tasked with preventing illegal aliens, terrorists, human and drug traffickers from entering the United States where all Nazis. Near-incessant headlines, hot-takes, and tweets from elected officials, former Obama White House flacks, and TV pundits all painted the picture that Border Patrol Agents apprehending the thousands of migrants illegally crossing the U.S. southern border were carrying out Adolf Hitler\u2019s expansion of the third Riech. A U.S. Border Patrol recruiter agent speaks to attendees of the Border Security Expo on April 12, 2017 at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio, Texas.\u00a0(John Moore/Getty Images) \u201cAsking to be considered a refugee & applying for status isn\u2019t a crime. It wasn\u2019t for Jewish families fleeing Germany,\u201d Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in November 2018, comparing the waves of foreign nationals traveling in media-dubbed \u201ccaravans\u201d being arrested and detained at the U.S.-Mexico border to Jews fleeing Hitler\u2019s Holocaust.  \u201cShould U.S. border detention facilities be compared to Nazi concentration camps?\u201d screeched a San Francisco Chronicle headline. \u201cOther governments have separated mothers and children,\u201d Former CIA and NSA chief Michael Hayden said in June 2018 in tweet that featured a black and white photo of the Birkenau concentration and death-camp in Poland.  What becomes clear here is the cockeyed illogic of the Woke, the virtue signaling political left, like the painfully out of touch Michael Hayden. Here, a four-star general who should know better chose to lecture the brave Border Patrol agents and cheapened their sacrifice and service in protecting our country\u2019s borders by comparing their selflessness to one of the most horrifying mass murders in the history of civilization. The fact, however, is that \u201cHispanics constitute 30 percent of the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officers and over half of Border Patrol Agents,\u201d said a 2017 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Federal Agency Annual EEO Program status report. The Border Patrol is part of the CBP, which enforces the law at the border. But the media and the left repeatedly banged the drum that the men and women protecting our often-dangerous southern border are comparable to Nazi tormentors, when, in fact, more than half of those federal agents are minorities. And it only makes sense that a border being overrun by people who come from countries where the language spoken is Spanish, should be guarded by people more likely to be fluent in that language. The Department of Homeland Security Management Directive Annual Report further acknowledged, to that end, that, \u201cCBP Officers and Border Patrol Agents require fluency in Spanish for initial placements along the southern border, Florida, and Puerto Rico, a requirement that is not present in the standard RCLF comparison. This job requirement, in conjunction with the high percentage of jobs being located in the southern Border States, greatly increased Hispanic representation in these occupations.\u201d  When the Border Patrol was formally established in 1924, Latino agents were few. Sixty years later, they made up nearly 36% of the agency. By the end of 2017, Latinos were more 51 percent of the Border Patrol. \u201cThe Border Patrol is the only major federal law enforcement agency in the country that has more minorities than it does whites. And yes, this is an organization that overwhelmingly supports President Trump,\u201d said Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, after a White House meeting with President Trump in January 2019. Indeed, President Donald Trump declared war on illegal immigration in no uncertain terms in 2017 when he announced a plan to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents and at least 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers to enforce his ambitious immigration enforcement agenda. A year later, \u201c10 out of the 11 people taking part in the Border Patrol citizens\u2019 academy were Latino,\u201d the L.A. Times reported. \u201cMost of the nearly dozen participants in the El Centro Sector Border Patrol citizens\u2019 academy were, in fact, of Mexican descent. The El Centro Sector is among the most vulnerable regions of the U.S.-Mexico border. From October 2018 to January, El Centro Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended at least eight illegal aliens who had been previously deported after being apprehended (most of them in California) and deported for committing sexual crimes \u2013 many of their victims were children, the CBP reported in early in 2019. Border Patrol agents in the nation\u2019s two busiest sectors of the U.S.-Mexico boundary \u2014 El Paso and Rio Grande Valley Sectors \u2014 apprehended an average of nearly 900 migrant families per day. \u201cSmugglers and traffickers have caught on that the outdated laws, lack of resources, and bad court decisions effectively give them a \u2018free ticket\u2019 into America,\u201d former U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Neilsen told the House Homeland Security Committee. \u201cMake no mistake: the problem is getting worse.\u201d",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Kennedy, a scion of one of America\u2019s most storied political families, will formally announce his candidacy this weekend, but officially informed of his intentions during a private meeting on Wednesday. The 38-year-old congressman has been laying the ground work for such a move since July when he quietly began commissioning polls on the feasibility of a challenge to Markey. Rumors of a campaign appeared confirmed last month when Kennedy began hiring staff and filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to begin raising money for a potential Senate bid. \u201cI don\u2019t think primaries are something that people should shy away from,\u201d Kennedy told reporters at the Massachusetts Democratic convention last week, according to the Associated Press. Markey, who was first elected to the Senate in a 2013 special election to replace former Secretary of State John Kerry, has shown no intention of taking the threat lightly. Since Kennedy first signaled he was contemplating a challenge, the senator revamped his campaign by bringing on a former chairman of the Massachusetts Democrat Party to run his day-to-day operations and has hired a top Washington, D.C. pollster. Markey has also worked to line up state and national Democrats behind his bid, most notably securing the endorsement of his congressional seat mate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Some of the Democrats endorsing Markey, though, including Warren, have refused to criticize Kennedy for challenging their preferred candidate.  A matchup between Kennedy and Markey is likely to elicit national attention as both men have cultivated larger profiles in recent years.\u00a0Kennedy, due to his family name and charisma, has been considered a rising star among Democrats for some time, but his path to higher office has not always been clear in deep-blue Massachusetts. Complicating matters for the congressman is that he has not always shone when put into the spotlight, as exhibited when his response to President Donald Trump\u2019s 2018 State of the Union was largely overshadowed by what appeared to be a drooling problem. Markey, on the other hand, has sought to distinguish himself by championing radical proposal to tackle climate change. Alongside freshman-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Markey was the primary author of the Green New Deal earlier this year. The 73-year-old senator, known as affable but stodgy, has also carved out a niche for himself by attacking the Trump administration over its energy policies through his position as ranking member of the Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Oversight. Those efforts seemed to have paid off as a number of the nation\u2019s top environmental groups have endorsed Markey\u2019s reelection. It is unclear, however, if Markey will be able to adequately campaign on his environmental record given he has taken thousands of dollars from oil and gas interests since promising to spur \u201ctheir dirty money.\u201d As Breitbart News reported in July, Markey\u2019s campaign has continued to accept money from oil and gas lobbyists even after the senator signed the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge in December 2018. An analysis of the senator\u2019s FEC filings indicated he has accepted thousands from individuals tied to petroleum giants like BP and Chevron. Despite institutional support and a record as one of the most liberal members of Congress, polling has shown Markey the underdog in any matchup against Kennedy. A survey released by Commonwealth magazine in August found the senator trailing Kennedy by as 17 percentage points \u2014 25 percent to 42 percent respectively. More troubling for Markey, the poll also found him narrowly losing a general election match up against incumbent Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, an unlikely but potential Senate candidate. Meanwhile, the poll found Kennedy beating Bakery by roughly 9 points, a still close but more comfortable margin. On Wednesday,\u00a0Markey made no mention of such polls when responding to news of Kennedy\u2019s candidacy. \u201cElections are about choices, and Ed looks forward to spending the next 14 months campaigning hard every day to show the people of the Commonwealth why he\u2019s the right choice,\u201d the senator\u2019s campaign said in a statement obtained by Politico.",

      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " \u201c[They wanted to] prevent me from being successful in a U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire,\u201d Lewandowski said, referring to\u00a0Democrats seated on the House Judiciary Committee during his Tuesday testimony before the government body. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to be a patsy,\u201d said Lewandowski. \u201cWhat they wanted to do \u2014 part of, I believe, the strategy of the Democrats in having me come before this hearing was to potentially prevent me from being successful in a U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire if I decide to get into the race.\u201d LISTEN: \u201cThey wanted me to go on camera and say things that they could then use \u2014 and the Democrats\u2019 operatives could use \u2014 against me, and I\u2019m not going to give them that privilege,\u201d added Lewandowski. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) is using his chairmanship of the House Judiciary Committee to arrange \u201cfacade\u201d hearings in an attempt to create self-serving video clips for his primary reelection campaign against Democrats challenging him from the left, assessed Lewandowski. Lewandowski highlighted former Reps. Joseph Crowley (D-NY) and Michael Capuano (D-MA), both Democrat incumbents unseated by then-primary opponents and now Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), respectively. Lewandowski said, \u201cThis was never about getting to the truth. This is all about [Democrats] covering their left flank. Specifically, Chairman Nadler knows that he has a very competitive primary on the Upper West Side of New York from a very aggressive far-left socialist, and if he isn\u2019t perceived as being more left than she is, he\u2019s going to lose his reelection effort the same way that Congressman Crowley and Congressman Capuano lost to far-left progressives. That\u2019s what this whole thing was about. I wasn\u2019t going to give them that satisfaction.\u201d \u201cUnelected bureaucrats\u201d forming \u201cthe deep state,\u201d said Lewandowski, are subverting President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cThe system is fundamentally broken. \u2026 I would love to say that this is just a problem under the Trump administration, but the truth is Ronald Reagan complained about what we call the deep state, today, some 30 years ago, so this is not a new phenomenon. But the difference is this, because Donald Trump \u2014 like Ronald Reagan \u2014 were true outsiders of Washington, DC, the deep state is more empowered and more emboldened today because this president has hired less people in the federal government than [previous] presidents.\u201d Lewandowski continued, \u201cI\u2019ve been highly critical of the administration \u2014 they weren\u2019t ready to go on day one, they didn\u2019t have their people in place, and that caused or allowed either the Obama holdovers to continue to exert their influence or allowed those career government officials who have a different agenda than this president to gain more influence, because Trump didn\u2019t staff the administration immediately.\u201d Lewandowski went on, \u201cAs a business executive, [Donald Trump] wants to do things with less people to save taxpayer dollars, and I think the administration made a mistake when they didn\u2019t have all the people ready to go in January of 2017, so the deep state is very real. I don\u2019t refer to them as tin foil hat-wearing individuals. These are the career government officials who know how to obfuscate, they know how to slow things down, they know how to get an order and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ll get to that in 30 days, 60 days, 90 days.'\u201d \u201cThe people who Trump has put in have tried to clear some of [deep state bureaucrats] out, but we\u2019ve heard even Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff of the White House say how impossible it is to get rid of some of these people.\u201d \u201cThe deep state is very real, and it\u2019s much more pronounced today because of the fact that Donald Trump was a true outsider, didn\u2019t bring a massive team into Washington, DC, with him, and continues to function as a chief executive with a smaller number of people in the government and that has really caused some of the problems that we see today. It needs to be solved.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to go down there and kick the doors down,\u201d said Lewandowski of his goal if\u00a0elected to the U.S. Senate.

      "content": " The New York lawmaker made the remarks during the House Committee on Oversight and Reform\u2019s hearing on the D.C. statehood bill\u00a0H.R. 51, which \u201cprovides for admission into the United States of the state of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, composed of most of the territory of the District of Columbia.\u201d \u201cThe commonwealth shall be admitted to the Union on an equal footing with the other states,\u201d the bill states. Ocasio-Cortez lamented the\u00a0\u201cdisenfranchisement\u201d of D.C. residents and connected the statehood issue to the \u201chistory of slavery.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said during the hearing, according to USA Today: Where the disenfranchisement of Puerto Ricans was rooted in the colonialist and imperialistic history that we\u2019ve had in policies of the United States, the issue of D.C. statehood is\u00a0rooted in a different evil in our history, which is the history of slavery in the United States, It is a profound injustice and a thick irony of our history that the people who fled here to the District of Columbia to free slavery because of the enlightenment of this community are now disenfranchised. She reiterated her remarks in a tweet posted Thursday afternoon. \u201cDC was the 1st territory in the United States to free the enslaved. It\u2019s where Black Americans fled the tyranny of slavery & towards greater freedom, to DC,\u201d she wrote, claiming that \u201c2nd class citizenship reigns\u201d in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cIt\u2019s time to recognize DC statehood,\u201d she declared:  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) also called for D.C. statehood in a tweet Thursday, writing, \u201cThere is no excuse for allowing 700,000 American citizens to go without representation in Congress simply because they live in Washington, DC. It\u2019s time to finally grant #DCStatehood\u201d:  However, ranking member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) rejected his Democrat colleagues\u2019 statehood push. \u201cWe cannot ignore the elephant in the room, ladies and gentlemen. The District government currently faces serious allegations of misconduct,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cSadly, the allegations against Mr. [Jack] Evans are just the latest in a series of local D.C. political scandals,\u201d he said, before adding, \u201cD.C. is simply not yet self-sustainable.\u201d \u201cThis is not what the Founding Fathers intended,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey understood and they carefully crafted the Constitution so that the seat of the federal government would purposely and specifically not be within a state.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) dismissed House Democrat efforts to push D.C. statehood during an interview with Fox News\u2019s Laura Ingraham in June: They plan to make the District of Columbia a state \u2014 that would give them two new Democratic senators \u2014 Puerto Rico a state, that would give them two more new Democratic senators, and as a former Supreme Court clerk yourself, you\u2019ve surely noticed that they plan to expand the Supreme Court. \u201cThis is full-bore socialism on the march in the House,\u201d he added, promising that \u201cnone of that stuff is going anywhere\u201d as long as he remains Senate Majority Leader. A Gallup poll released in July indicated that the vast majority of Americans \u2013 64 percent \u2013 do not support formally adding Washington D.C. to the union as the 51st state.",

Joe Kennedy (D-MA). Ocasio-Cortez, who is actively backing\u00a0primary challenges to moderate House Democrats, praised Markey as a champion of progressive values. \u201cSen. Markey is the generational change we\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said of the 73-year-old senator, before adding \u201cgenerational change\u201d is about issues, not simply electing \u201cwhoever is younger.\u201d   Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments comments come one day after news broke that Kenendy will announce his campaign on Saturday. Kennedy, the\u00a038-year-old congressman scion of one America\u2019s most storied political families, has been laying the groundwork for a run since July, when he quietly commissioned polls testing his viability against Markey. His intentions only seemed to be confirmed last month when he began\u00a0hiring\u00a0staff and\u00a0filed\u00a0paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to begin raising money for the race. Markey, who was first elected to the Senate in a 2013 special election to replace former Secretary of State John Kerry, has shown no intention of taking the threat lightly. Over the summer, Markey\u00a0revamped\u00a0his campaign apparatus by bringing on a former chairman of the Massachusetts Democrat Party to run its day-to-day operations. The senator has also hired a top Washington, D.C., polling firm. Apart from building out his campaign infrastructure, Markey has worked to line up state and national Democrats behind his bid. One of those Democrats has been Ocasio-Cortez, with whom Markey worked to author and introduce the Green New Deal earlier this year. \u201cEd Markey, I know, is one of the strongest progressives that we have in the United States Senate,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in a video endorsement trumpeted by the senator\u2019s campaign last week. \u201cHe\u2019s not just resting on his record of the past, but he\u2019s aggressively pursuing an agenda for the future \u2026 And that\u2019s what a progressive is, and that\u2019s what progressivism is all about.\u201d",

The increase in Democrat calls for impeachment comes from an August whistleblower complaint from a U.S. intelligence official amid efforts from Democrats to learn more about Trump\u2019s ties with Ukraine. These same Democrats are trying to get ahold of the complaint. Trump acknowledged that he had talked with the Ukranian president about an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden while speaking with reporters on trips to Texas and Ohio on Saturday. \u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption\u2013 all of the corruption taking place\u2013 and largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Trump said.",

Before making his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City Tuesday, the president told reporters he gave the order because he felt other allied nations weren\u2019t providing enough. \u201cAs far as withholding funds, those funds were paid,\u201d President Trump said. \u201cThey were fully paid.\u201d \u201cI want other countries to put up money. I think it\u2019s unfair that we put up the money,\u201d he added. \u201cThen other people call me. They said, \u2018Oh, let it go.\u2019 And I let it go. But we paid the money, the money was paid.\u201d Many congressional Democrats are calling for an impeachment investigation against President Trump, based on news reports that the president pressured Zelensky to investigate the Biden family, though it is unclear if he broke the law by asking for a new inquiry to be made. Further, The alleged \u201cwhistleblower\u201d who reportedly claims to have knowledge of the president pressuring Zelensky, did not hear the pair\u2019s conversation first hand. As Breitbart News\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called\u00a0Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even\u00a0boasted\u00a0to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son\u2019s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son \u2014 who enriched himself using his father\u2019s prestige. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Tuesday that she will make an announcement this afternoon after she meets with House chairmen and members of the Democrat caucus. According to NBC analyst Howard Fineman, the speaker will\u00a0announce a formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump and suggest that she herself supports Congress removing the president.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Article II, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution defines the criteria for impeachment: \u201cThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d A reasonable observer would have trouble finding anything President Donald Trump had done to meet that standard, but Democrats have a list of reasons: 1. They don\u2019t like him!\u00a0Democrats \u2014 and \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans \u2014 have been talking about impeachment since early 2016, arguing that since impeachment is an inherently political process they can do it for any reason. 2. He stole the 2016 election!\u00a0Many Democrats still believe Trump cheated, even after Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no collusion with Russia, and there is no evidence Russia affected significant numbers of votes. 3. He has business interests!\u00a0Trump has businesses, such as hotels, that include foreign customers. Democrats claim that violates the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits accepting foreign gifts and titles. 4. He has violated the Constitution!\u00a0Except\u2026 the Supreme Court has upheld almost every single Trump policy. (One rare exception: the Supreme Court struck down the Census citizenship question, but for procedural reasons.) 5. He colluded with the Russians!\u00a0But: \u201c[T]he\u00a0investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\u201d 6: He obstructed justice!\u00a0The Special Counsel \u201cdid not draw a conclusion one way or the other,\u201d but the attorney general said there was insufficient evidence, and the White House withheld nothing from the investigation. 7. They need to find evidence!\u00a0Democrats admit there is no evidence\u00a0yet to impeach the president for anything, but that they can only get the information they need for impeachment once there is an impeachment inquiry. (Get that?) 8. He pushed Ukraine to investigate Biden! Joe Biden arguably obstructed justice by threatening to withhold U.S. aid to an ally unless it fired a prosecutor investigating his son. Trump urged an inquiry but offered no quid pro quo. 9. (Quietly: there may be no other way to beat him!) Trump\u2019s approval rating is high; the economy is defying the \u00a0recession hype; and the country is safe. Impeachment is a vote of no confidence in the 2020 Democratic field. Joel B.

      "subtitle": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) all represent the nation\u2019s \u201cworst sanctuary cities,\u201d according to a new ranking by the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI).",
      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " Among the top ten worst sanctuary cities in the United States \u2014 that is, jurisdictions that shield criminal illegal aliens from arrest and deportation by federal immigration officials \u2014 Pelosi\u2019s home city of San Francisco, California, ranks as the most hostile to enforcement of national immigration law. Before California became a sanctuary state, the San Francisco Sheriff\u2019s Department released more than 530 criminal illegal aliens back onto the streets, hundreds of which had allegedly committed violent crimes, according to IRLI analysis. The most famous case involved the death of Kate Steinle, who was killed when five-time deported illegal alien\u00a0Jose Inez Garcia-Zarate fired a gun and wounded her. Garcia-Zarate was found not guilty of murdering Steinle, meaning the jury believed the illegal alien accidentally shot the firearm and the bullet accidentally hit and killed Steinle. Most recently, Garcia-Zarate escaped the only guilty verdict, illegal gun possession, he faced. IRLI Executive Director Dale Wilcox exclusively told SiriusXM Patriot\u2019s Breitbart News Daily that sanctuary policies like those implemented across the state of California are actually an effort by elected Democrats to win over illegal aliens, whom they view as potential voters down the road. \u201cApplying the Rule of Law is what sets us apart from most every other country on the face of the earth \u2026 these politicians are playing political games,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about power, it\u2019s all about trolling for potential future voters \u2026 sadly the Democrat Party has pretty much wholesale sold out to this belief that we need to keep these criminals in our communities.\u201d \u201cNobody will listen to their \u2026 people with reasonable minds will not vote for their policies, so they are importing voters,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad. It\u2019s putting innocent people at risk.\u201d Also topping the list as most egregious sanctuary cities are Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s New York City, New York, and Omar\u2019s Minnesota, Minneapolis. New York City, for example, likely freed about 2,900 criminal illegal aliens back into the general public last year. Between January and March 2018, New York City officials released 440 criminal illegal aliens deemed \u201cdangerous\u201d who were ordered to be deported. About ten percent of those illegal aliens went on to commit additional crimes. Minneapolis, ranked third on the list, has similar but different issues with their sanctuary city policies, according to IRLI analysts. While San Francisco and New York City seek to protect illegal aliens, Minneapolis tends to protect Somali refugees from deportation. Between 2016 and 2018, Minneapolis released about 90 criminal illegal aliens back onto the streets \u2014 the majority were from Mexico or Somalia. Home to about 100,000 Somali nationals and in\u00a0Cedar-Riverside in Hennepin County, commonly referred to as \u201cLittle Mogadishu,\u201d violent crime has increased by about 56 percent between 2010 and 2018. Much of that violent crime spike can be attributed to rivaling foreign gangs such as the Somali Mafia and the Somali Outlaws. \u201cAs with most of these sanctuary cities, when you look at the crime rates, if they\u2019re going to thumb their nose at the rule of law, they\u2019re going to do it wholesale across the board,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cSo you see murder rates, you see crime rates when you see these cities institute sanctuary policies. It creeps into every other area of life and it will ruin a community.\u201d Other sanctuary cities, including Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Seattle, Washington; Chicago, Illinois; Montgomery County, Maryland; Fairfax County, Virginia; Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland; Boston, Massachusetts; and Santa Clara County, California, are named on the list for shielding accused child rapists, MS-13 gang members, and alleged mass murderers from deportation.

But Pelosi pushed back constantly, as she had done when some Democrats started talking impeachment during the 2018 midterm elections (partly at the urging of billionaire mega-donor Tom Steyer, now running for president). Pelosi vowed that the facts would guide her, particularly the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller into allegations of \u201cRussian collusion\u201d with the Trump campaign and obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.

She will make her stand based on the supposed principle that Congress is entitled to information from a reported whistleblower complaint that the administration has withheld thus far. Yet Pelosi has other avenues, such as the courts, to pursue that information. She has been forced to change her view on impeachment because she no longer controls her caucus. AOC and the Squad have won; they hold real power. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "subtitle": "Democrat-led impeachment of President Donald Trump is \u201can attack on us\u201d and \u201cour constitutional system,\u201d explained Mark Levin, who joined host Alex Marlow on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily\u00a0on Wednesday.",
      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " Levin described disdain for America\u2019s founding among Democrats and the broader left. \u201cThe people who believe the country began in 1619 with slavery, who accuse the Founders of being white supremacists and trash the Constitution as nothing more than a document to protect white slave owners keep waving around the Constitution as they advance their Marxist agenda,\u201d began Levin. LISTEN:  Levin continued, \u201cNancy Pelosi is undermining the Constitution as she claims to be promoting it and cites Benjamin Franklin at the end of the Constitutional Convention. The way this is supposed to work, impeachment is considered an extremely grave act. That\u2019s the way the Framers debated it. It was the second-most debated subject at the Constitutional Convention after the nature of the presidency.\u201d Levin went on, \u201c[The Framers] rejected things like maladministration as a basis for impeachment. They rejected the idea that pure politics should be the basis for impeachment, so they put specific language in the Constitution about high crimes and misdemeanors and a specific process: a majority vote by the House, a supermajority vote after a trial in the Senate overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court.\u201d \u201cThis is not intended to be some kind of political act,\u201d continued Levin. \u201d I hear these so-called experts on TV saying impeachment is whatever the House says it is, citing Gerald Ford. That\u2019s not what the history of our Impeachment Clause is. [The Framers] looked very deeply at British common law, what the Parliament had done with respect to the monarch; they rejected all sorts of proposals, and this is a very high bar. It\u2019s not just, \u2018Well, we don\u2019t like a president\u2019 or \u2018We think he did this, that, and the other thing.'\u201d Levin described how the Framers feared a usurpation of the president\u2019s accountability to the public via impeachment from the House, establishing a secondary constitutional check on the process within the Senate. \u201cThe Senate is in place under the impeachment process to keep a check on the House because they were concerned \u2014 if you look at Federalist 65 \u2014 there was some concern that the House would have too much power,\u201d Levin stated. \u201cThe great fear was that a president wouldn\u2019t be accountable to the public, but he\u2019d be accountable to the House of Representatives, and that\u2019s why they set up this elaborate process.\u201d Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is using the impeachment process to protect her political position \u2014 and that of her House Democrat favorites \u2014 from left-wing challengers, estimated Levin. \u201cSo what did Nancy Pelosi do yesterday?\u201d asked Levin. \u201cNothing. She\u2019s got six of her politburo chairman-types that she handpicks, who have the same ideology out of these deep blue metropolitan areas that are not representative of the diversity of this nation out of mostly New York and Los Angeles, who do what? Who are going to continue to conduct themselves as she announces a formal impeachment inquiry.\u201d Levin went on, \u201c[Nancy Pelosi] doesn\u2019t have a vote of the full House of Representatives, which is the traditional process that we have in this country. Why? Because if you\u2019re going to go down this road, you need the body politic. You need the so-called representatives of the people engaged in this. She, like a dictator, issues a fiat to her six handpicked chairmen to conduct a formal impeachment inquiry.\u201d Levin said, \u201cSo, in other words, a tiny percentage of the House of Representatives \u2014\u00a0 a tiny percentage of the population of the United States \u2014 is going to drag this entire nation through their left-wing hell because this is something they\u2019ve been dreaming to do from the moment this president was elected, and she\u2019s going to protect her so-called moderates, of which there are really only a handful, because she wants to cling to power, so there won\u2019t be a roll call vote on the floor of the House of Representatives? The fact is nothing has changed, other than her putting a different label on what she\u2019s doing, and, of course, the media love it.\u201d Pelosi fears internal Democrat challenges from the left, assessed Levin. \u201cI think that Nancy Pelosi \u2014 despite all the propaganda on her behalf as the first woman speaker \u2014 is weak,\u201d Levin remarked. \u201cShe buckled. She\u2019s befuddled. She\u2019s got a radical Marxist wing in her party and a radical antisemitic wing in her party. She\u2019s got [Jerry Nadler], who is being challenged in his Democrat primary by somebody, believe it or not, who is to the left of him, and they\u2019re doing this throughout her leadership.\u201d \u201c[Nancy Pelosi] already lost one of her big guys to AOC,\u201d recalled Levin. \u201cSo they\u2019re scared, and they want to cling to power, and this is the best she can figure out how to do it, but she\u2019s dragging the nation through her hell. The media love this.\u201d Levin praised Breitbart News. \u201cLet me say this. You guys do tremendous work. Tremendous work. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of what you guys are doing. You came under attack, vicious attack. It\u2019s just amazing. You guys are accused of being alt-right. You\u2019re the biggest supporters of state of Israel anywhere that I can see. You\u2019re being attacked for your [so-called] extremist views. You\u2019re constitutionalists. You support what this country is doing. This is what they do. They try to destroy, smear, character-assassinate anybody who dares to stand up for liberty in this country, so keep it up.\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) will not respond to his invitations for discussion, Levin shared. \u201cAs far as AOC is concerned, she\u2019s a reprobate,\u201d Levin stated.\u201dIf she wants to run the country, then run for president. Other than that, she\u2019s nothing more than a media creation. They celebrate her. I\u2019ve invited her on every one of my platforms. Whether it\u2019s TV, whether it\u2019s digital TV, whether it\u2019s radio, and we get crickets. She is a coward, and she is a dunce.\u201d Senate Republicans refuse to investigate possible corruption on the part of Joe Biden and other Democrats, noted Levin. \u201cThey\u2019re doing nothing,\u201d said Levin of Republican senators. \u201cHow is it that the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is supposedly run by this guy Richard Burr \u2014 who\u2019s in the Witness Protection Program \u2014 how is it that they can\u2019t hold a hearing on Hunter and Joe Biden? Where are their subpoenas?\u201d Levin asked, \u201cOur good friend Lindsey Graham, where is he? He runs the Senate Judiciary Committee. I hear all the talk. How about a little bit of action? What are they doing on the Foreign Affairs Committee? How is it that they\u2019re not issuing subpoenas? How is it that they\u2019re not demanding public testimony? You know, we do control the Senate, and it is appalling to me what\u2019s taking place here.\u201d \u201cThe Biden family is corrupt,\u201d determined Levin. \u201cJoe came into office \u2014 36 years in the Senate followed by eight years as vice president. He\u2019s a multimillionaire. His son is a multimillionaire. His brother is a multimillionaire. They have an IQ of negative 19, combined. How the hell did this happen? We\u2019d like to know.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on us,\u201d concluded Levin of Democrats\u2019 pursuing impeachment of Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on our constitutional system, and I would argue that what these people are doing is absolutely un-American, period.\u201d Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

The President engaged in an outright betrayal of our country. On Tuesday, before the transcript\u2019s release, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House was launching an \u201cofficial impeachment inquiry\u201d into President Trump. Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the \u201cSquad\u201d have long-called for Trump\u2019s impeachment and suggested that Pelosi would catch up to their calls. The transcript showed that Trump asked Zelenksy to help him look into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. Zelensky mentioned that one of his assistants spoke to Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, who is looking into Joe Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine. The entirety of Trump\u2019s remarks about Biden: There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it. \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.

      "content": " Her remarks come after months of infighting between far-left members of the \u201cSquad\u201d and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who has tried to dial back the remarks and efforts from the ultra-progressive wing of her caucus. According to Axios, Ocasio-Cortez welcomed the official inquiry, proclaiming that the effort puts the party \u201cin a new direction.\u201d \u201cThis puts the party in a new direction\u2026 The party is unified. The power behind that, and the weight behind that adds an urgency and an expeditiousness to the investigations that I don\u2019t believe we would\u2019ve seen,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said:  The freshman lawmaker\u2019s declaration follows months of tension over the general direction of the Democrat Party, which boiled over after Pelosi accepted a bipartisan emergency funding package over the \u201cSquad\u2019s\u201d version over the summer. Emotions ran even higher after the speaker dismissed the far-left \u201cSquad\u201d members in a July 6 interview with the New York Times. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez openly aired out the Democrat Party\u2019s dirty laundry on Twitter.  They eventually made amends, meeting at the end of July to clear the air. Pelosi told a reporter following the meeting that the two did not have \u201cthat many differences.\u201d  However, the ongoing battle for the heart of the party has not stopped. The impeachment effort has been at the center of the \u201cSquad\u2019s\u201d agenda. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) said on her first day in office that they were going to \u201cimpeach the motherfucker.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez called for impeachment prior to taking office, appearing on the Real America with Jorge Ramos show in November 2018, and calling impeachment a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d \u201cI mean, yeah. To me, it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cWell, I believe that he has violated the law.\u201d \u201cViolated potentially many laws, whether it\u2019s the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because he keeps his businesses open that foreign actors kind of participate in financial transactions with,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhether it\u2019s what we are seeing with potentially illegal buyouts of campaign, you know, FEC violations of women that he is trying to silence,\u201d she added, mentioning the bar \u201cRepublicans held for impeaching Bill Clinton.\u201d \u201cBut overall, you look at the bar that the Republicans held for impeaching Bill Clinton and somehow impeaching Donald Trump is supposed to be beyond the pale? It seems ridiculous to me,\u201d she added. In September, Ocasio-Cortez dared Senate Republicans to go on the record and \u201cknowingly vote against impeachment of this president knowing his corruption\u201d so they can \u201chave that stain on their careers the rest of their lives\u201d:  She took another veiled shot at Democrats last week, tweeting, \u201cAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior \u2013 it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it\u201d:  Pelosi demonstrated\u00a0consistent efforts to stall the calls from her far-left colleagues, urging them in a caucus-wide call last month to follow the facts and warning them that the public \u201cisn\u2019t there\u201d yet on impeachment. As Breitbart News\u2019s Joel Pollak noted: But Pelosi is no longer waiting for the facts. She will make her stand based on the supposed principle that Congress is entitled to information from a reported whistleblower complaint that the administration has withheld thus far. Yet Pelosi has other avenues, such as the courts, to pursue that information. She has been forced to change her view on impeachment because she no longer controls her caucus. \u201cAOC and the Squad have won; they hold real power,\u201d he added.",

Nydia Velazquez (@NydiaVelazquez) September 25, 2019  Attorney General Barr must set aside from this investigation. He\u2019s a witness that will be called testify. \u2014 Joaquin Castro (@JoaquinCastrotx) September 25, 2019  A President pressing a foreign government to investigate a political opponent is a severe abuse of power. Our country strongly rejected Trump\u2019s pressure on Russia to dig up dirt on his opponent in 2016. For him to do it again, shows a complete disregard for the American people. https://t.co/tc0k17LOvA \u2014 Eliot Engel (@RepEliotEngel) September 25, 2019 ",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The proposal is six-fold, with each section aiming to combat poverty at a slightly different angle. The proposal includes giving illegal immigrants access to federal public benefits such as Medicaid, NPR reports. \u201cImmigrants pay taxes, and when we begin to unify our systems, I think that we will get more cohesive immigration policy, economic policy, political policy,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, according to NPR. \u201cAnd I think it sends a message that if you contribute to our society, you should benefit from our society. Why should a billionaire who evades taxes collect Social Security, too?\u201d she asked. \u201cI think that what we can do is we can tighten up our systems and increase accountability,\u201d she continued, adding that her proposal sends the message that the U.S. will \u201cnot discriminate solely based on immigration status.\u201d Her \u201csix-piece suite\u201d includes: The Recognizing Poverty Act would, according to Ocasio-Cortez, \u201cupdate the national poverty guidelines in order for us to acknowledge modern life.\u201d That includes childcare and \u201cnew necessities\u201d like Internet access. The Place to Prosper Act gives access to a \u201ccounsel fund\u201d for renters who are facing eviction and \u201cimposes a national cap of 3% on annual rent increases and begins to pursue penalties\u201d on what the freshman lawmaker calls \u201cabusive and predatory landlords.\u201d Additionally, the Mercy in Re-Entry act extends the \u201csocial safety net\u201d to former convicts who \u201cduly paid their debt to society,\u201d while the Embrace Act expands entitlement benefits to illegal immigrants. The Uplift Our Workers Act directs the federal government to \u201cprefer doing business with worker-friendly contractors\u201d based on a \u201cworker-friendly score,\u201d which Ocasio-Cortez likens to LEED certification. She also urges Congress to ratify the U.N. Covenant on Economic, Social, & Cultural Rights, which recognizes the right to\u00a0\u201ctake part in cultural life\u201d as well as the right to \u201cenjoy the benefits of scientific progress.\u201d It also recognizes the right to \u201can adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions.\u201d \u201cIn a modern, moral, and wealthy society, no person should be too poor to live,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cThat\u2019s what a just society means to me\u201d:  \u201cI am both energized and humbled to introduce legislation today to build upon the most transformative programs of the last century,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said of her proposal in a statement. \u201cFrom the New Deal to the Great Society, we have shown time and again that our nation is capable of implementing big ideas and bold solutions that match the scale of the challenges we face,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe must once again recognize the breadth and consequences of poverty in this country and work together to ensure a path forward to economic freedom for everyone,\u201d she added.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said the \u201cground has shifted\u201d towards the support of the impeachment of President Donald\u00a0Trump. She argued it was because \u201cthis Ukraine allegation is incredibly serious and very urgent.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cThe Judiciary Committee has long been investigating many of the violations of the president, but this Ukraine allegation is head and shoulders one of the most serious and urgent allegations that we have seen come out of this administration to date. And so I think it\u2019s completely understandable that we\u2019ve seen this. I think it\u2019s an allegation that frankly has united more members of the party on impeachment than any other. So for that, I think it\u2019s an understandable decision that we make. That being said, I do think it\u2019s important that we continue to tell the story of the other violations, whether it\u2019s emoluments, whether it\u2019s having diplomats staying at Trump properties. I think all of these things need to be looked into, but this Ukraine allegation is incredibly serious and very urgent.\u201d She continued, \u201cWhat also makes this urgent is that this is about something that is going to happen \u2014 the 2020 election. We have the opportunity to act now to prevent a profoundly destabilizing action, an intervention in our democracy before it happens. I think that is a profoundly urgent action that we need to take right now and everything else is just as serious. All of these transgressions against our democracy are extremely serious, but we are investigating things unfortunately that have already happened. When it comes to Ukraine, we are talking about potentially meddling in the 2020 election that has still yet to happen.\u201d She added, \u201cThis is completely different. What we are talking about here is the president essentially participating in what looks like a series of events that looks like extortion. Withholding aid to an ally and then, quote-unquote, asking for a favor to essentially benefit yourself politically, not in the interest of the United States of America, but in the interest of your own reelection.\u201d She concluded, \u201cI think the ground has shifted. I don\u2019t believe in making decisions based on polling. I believe in our ability to organize the public, to educate the public, to talk to the public about why not just we as members of Congress must impeach the president but why all people in the United States of America must recognize and understand that we need to put our country first before our considerations of reelection. And that goes from members of Congress all the way up to the president of the United States.\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

A whistleblower has alleged Trump\u00a0violated federal campaign finance laws by threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky\u2019s government investigated the former vice president and 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden for corruption. The White House released on Wednesday a transcript of the call in which the two heads of state discussed Biden, but the transcript showed no discussion of military aid or any quid pro quo. In the phone transcript, Trump said: There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you \u00b7can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me. Trump tweeted Wednesday that he supports full transparency on the whistleblower information, but added that transparency is also needed from Biden and any potential wrongdoing concerning his son, Hunter.  The president was referencing a 2018 letter sent to Ukrainian officials by\u00a0Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy urging them to continue investigations into President Trump\u2019s alleged collusion with Russia in the 2016 presidential campaign. Such allegations have since proven baseless. \u201cThe Democrats have done what they\u2019re accusing me of doing,\u201d Trump said during a press conference on Wednesday.

Burchett said that it wouldn\u2019t have been left to a whistleblower if Trump had done something criminal on his phone call with the Ukrainian president that included a reference to former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cI think if you just read the transcript of the conversation \u2013 I mean, you have to ask yourself why there\u2019s more than a dozen people who had firsthand knowledge of that conversation who were there monitoring it and none of them have come forward to say that there was a problem with it,\u201d Burchett said.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced a formal impeachment inquiry of the president loosely based on a whistleblower complaint, which was released Thursday. Although the complaint was not based on firsthand knowledge, Democrats ran with it, using it as momentum to launch the impeachment probe. President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky remains at the center of the controversy, but a transcript of the conversation shows no criminal behavior, quid pro quo, or \u201cpressure\u201d on the Ukrainian leader in any capacity. Far-left members of the \u201cSquad\u201d have been calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment for months and were banking on the Mueller report to implicate the president. However, Mueller found no evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. Nonetheless, Pelosi is attempting to resurrect the Russia conspiracy theories, telling Morning Joe on Friday that Russia played a part in the Ukraine phone call. She offered no evidence to back the egregious claim. Rep.

      "content": " The self-described socialist lawmakers were spotted dining together at the Penny Cluse Cafe on Saturday, accompanied by Sanders\u2019 wife, Jane, and campaign manager\u00a0Faiz Shakir:  The nature of their discussion remains a mystery, but it has reignited rumors of a potential endorsement on the horizon, as the Burlington Free Press noted:  The meeting follows weeks of internal frenzy for the Sanders campaign, which recently shook up its staffers in New Hampshire following concerns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-MA) surge in the early primary state \u2014 one Sanders won handily against former opponent Hillary Clinton in 2016. Shortly after, the Sanders campaign shook things up in Iowa, removing Jess Mazour as the campaign\u2019s Iowa political director. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to make moves that we feel best position this campaign to win,\u201d Shakir\u00a0told\u00a0the Washington Post of the move. Both moves followed Sanders\u2019 loss of the Working Families Party (WFP) endorsement to Warren. \u201cSenator Warren strikes fear into the hearts of the robber barons who rigged the system, and offers hope to millions of working people who have been shut out of our democracy and economy,\u201d WFP National Party Director Maurice Mitchell\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement following the endorsement, according to\u00a0Politico. Democrat operatives \u2014 as well as former and current Sanders supporters \u2014 are worried about Sanders\u2019 style and general ability to adapt, and those concerns are driving some to Warren instead. As Politico reported: As Sanders has stagnated and Warren has soared, even some of the Vermont senator\u2019s supporters are expressing alarm. Something is off, they say privately, adding to the chorus of people in establishment political circles saying the same thing. Maybe he should explain how he\u2019s different from Warren \u2014 he has deliberately avoided any hint of criticism of her \u2014 or commit to out-organizing her in the early nominating states. Or perhaps he needs to make nice with the media and hire more seasoned pros. Or what about going all-in on Iowa? The ideas from his volunteers, former aides, past delegates, steering committee members, and even some people within his campaign, vary. But they almost all come back to the same fundamental question, a question that has confounded the campaign since its earliest days: Can Bernie Sanders \u2014 a 78-year-old iconoclast whose entire identity is about standing firm in his beliefs, damn it \u2014 change? Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow socialist, has yet to endorse a presidential candidate, but it is possible that the Sanders campaign is seeking one in hopes of a boost, particularly among idealistic and ultra-leftist millennial supporters. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are on the same page on a variety of hot-button Democrat issues \u2014 particularly the Green New Deal. Sanders rolled out the most aggressive climate change agenda of any of his competitors last month, clocking in around $16 trillion. The two socialist lawmakers are also strong advocates for Medicare for All. While the New York lawmaker has praised Sanders in the past for wielding \u201cenormous political courage\u201d on behalf of others, she has stopped short of endorsing him:  She told CNN in May that she was looking for a candidate who has a \u201ccoherent worldview and logic from which all these policy proposals are coming forward.\u201d \u201cI think Sen. Sanders has that. I also think Sen. Warren has that,\u201d she added: ",

      "subtitle": "Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment is far from a reality, but the media are already speculating as to who should get credit for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision last week to unilaterally announce the start of an inquiry into the president\u2019s phone conversation with the Ukrainian president in July.",
      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": " CNN decided that five freshman Democrat women in the House \u2014 who are white \u2014 should get the credit in a big way: \u201cThese five freshman congresswomen changed history by becoming unlikely leaders on impeachment\u201d the headline of the story read. Meanwhile, a writer for the Intercept took offense at CNN\u2019s claim and penned\u00a0an article on the \u201cheroes\u201d behind an effort to remove a duly elected president with this headline: \u201cTrump Attacked the Women of Color Who Led the Push for Impeachment. Then CNN Erased Them.\u201d CNN\u2019s piece argues that the five \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrats were the impetus for the Party to embrace the impeachment effort: When a group of moderate House freshmen Democrats moved from hard no to hell yes on starting an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, they changed the dynamic for House Democrats, and indeed \u2014 the course of history. The reason they made their announcement and explained their reasoning as a group, in an op-ed in The Washington Post, is because they had already formed a bond over their national security background \u2014 especially the five women: Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, both ex-CIA officers; Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania who was in the Air Force; Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia were Naval officers. They became fast friends, and called themselves the \u201cbadasses.\u201d \u201cI think badasses kind of came organically from the group since we all had either served in the military or in the CIA,\u201d Houlahan said. CNN reported: The op-ed the women penned, along with Gil Cisneros and Jason Crow, two freshmen male veterans, opened the floodgates for others who had been resistant, and gave House Speaker Nancy Pelosi critical political cover as she announced a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. \u201cA great example of the power of teamwork,\u201d Houlahan said. And while CNN does mention \u201cthe so-called squad\u201d of freshman women in the House although not by name, the Intercept article argued that on top of Trump\u2019s criticism of the far-left lawmakers \u2013 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) \u2013 CNN \u201cerased\u201d them \u2014 all \u201cwomen of color\u201d \u2014 from the impeachment scenario. \u201cThe Squad, alongside a number of other progressive members of Congress, many of them people of color, do deserve the credit for pushing the House toward impeachment,\u201d the Intercept article said. The Intercept\u2019s report said the media \u201chas selected different heroes of the burgeoning impeachment effort \u2014 without including the leftist women of color.\u201d The Intercept slammed CNN for its selection: According to a weekend CNN feature, credit for the impeachment effort should instead go to four [sic] freshmen members of Congress \u2014 all of them white women with backgrounds in national security work. These women, who rather unbearably call themselves \u201cthe badasses,\u201d only came around to supporting impeachment in the last two weeks. Trump \u2014 in his identification of the Squad as the source of his problems \u2014 has hit on something that CNN can\u2019t seem to grasp: Women of color are leading the way on these efforts. Yet, instead of rousing defenses against Trump\u2019s attacks and acknowledgements of the political risks women of color are taking, the media seems to be writing them out of the story. The CNN feature paints a picture of lawmakers who have bonded over their careers, as mothers of young children and now members of Congress. But the Intercept sees race as the real issue and included a statement from someone who agrees. \u201cWhite people being credited for something initiated or created by people of color is nothing new, but it\u2019s always infuriating when it has to be pointed out,\u201d Paul Meara for BET, wrote in response to CNN\u2019s piece. \u201dThe CNN article, written by Dana Bash, is peppered with the lexicon of a personified pink pussy hat; the women are framed with all the trappings of white liberal feminism,\u201d the Intercept article said.

Schwarzman, who was asked to defend billionaires. \u201cMaybe Bernie shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d Schwarzman, who has an estimated net worth of more than $17 billion, reportedly said. The freshman lawmaker tried to soften Sanders\u2019 remarks. \u201c\u2018Billionaires should not exist\u2019 does not mean certain people should not exist,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt means no person should have a billion dollars.\u201d She added that the \u201cascent of billionaires is a symptom & outcome of an immoral system\u201d:  Sanders\u2019 \u201cextreme wealth tax\u201d goes further than Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-MA), his counterpart. Under his plan, couples who have a net worth of more than $32 million would face a one percent tax, the tax rising as the net worth increases: The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. Sanders also plans to create a \u201cnational wealth registry\u201d and increase IRS funding to handle a wave of new audits. University of California, Berkeley, economists\u00a0Emmanuel Saez\u00a0and\u00a0Gabriel Zucman estimate that Sanders\u2019 wealth tax would result in an additional $4.5 trillion in revenue over the next ten years, which fails to scratch a dent in Sanders\u2019 costly proposals. His Green New Deal, the most ambitious climate change plan of all the Democrat candidates, will cost at least $16 trillion alone. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s remarks come just days after the two socialist lawmakers dined together at the\u00a0Penny Cluse Cafe in Burlington, Vermont:  While the far-left \u201cSquad\u201d member has yet to endorse a presidential candidate, her recent defense of Sanders is likely to fuel further speculation.",

Its founder, Lyndon LaRouche Jr. \u2013 who ran for president eight times between 1976 and 2004 (often as a Democrat) \u2013 touted\u00a0a swath of bizarre conspiracy theories and created a cult-like following.

He said former Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos \u201cwas opposed to me and he fell as a result.\u201d LaRouche called for a quarantine of AIDS victims and said most medical warnings about how the disease was spread were lies. He also referred to Zionism as \u201ccult nonsense\u201d and said the Holocaust was \u201cmythical.\u201d The Anti-Defamation League of B\u2019nai B\u2019rith once characterized LaRouche\u2019s organization as an anti-Semitic political cult.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " After answering a question about a proposed monorail to deal with climate change, she declared: When it comes to the Green New Deal, people are, like \u2014 and of course, they come from this zero-sum mentality: \u201cWe\u2019re going to take away your hamburgers. We\u2019re going to take away your airplanes. We\u2019re going to take away all of these things.\u201d And really, what this is asking us is what are we going to make, not what are we going to take away \u2014 what are we going to establish. And, frankly, for everyone who says a Green New Deal is going to ground planes, I guarantee you, climate change \u2014 which threatens storms, turbulence, airplane groundings, and airport closures \u2014 will ground airplanes far sooner and far worse than any sort of climate legislation ever would if we made, for example, scientific investments in zero-carbon airplanes and flights and things like that, which, I believe, at some point, you know, hopefully we\u2019ll be able to create that kind of technology. But it takes thinking like this to do it. So, thank you.  Last week,\u00a0Forbes described the current state of engineering regarding \u201czero-emission airplanes.\u201d Currently, there are small, battery-operated aircraft that are capable of making short trips. Airbus plans to introduce a prototype of a commercial-size hybrid aircraft in 2021 that uses three traditional jet fuel engines and one electric one, though the design is not expected to be in commercial use for two decades \u2014 far beyond the Green New Deal\u2019s 12-year horizon. Forbes concluded: \u201cMany experts predict that electric planes could be relatively commonplace within 20 years. However, they will likely be small planes that can hold around 100 passengers and will fly mostly between regional airports.\u201d There is no feasible solution \u2014 yet \u2014 for long-distance commercial flight involving large numbers of passengers or significant cargo loads that does not involve the use of jet fuel. In 2016, the\u00a0Solar Impulse 2 (above), a solar-powered aircraft, circumnavigated the globe \u2014 but the journey took more than four months and the aircraft could only fly in good weather. In addition, it only weighed about 2 tons. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s suggestion (via the Washington Free Beacon)\u00a0came at the same town hall meeting at which she was urged by a prankster to adopt a new campaign slogan, \u201cEat the Babies,\u201d to convey the urgency of climate change, which could end the world in the near future. The prank took in many observers \u2014 including Ocasio-Cortez herself \u2014 partly because the proposal resembles some of the more creative ideas that the representative has proposed to deal with the problem of climate change. In the past, for example, Ocasio-Cortez has said that she planned to have \u201cone less child\u201d for fear of the impacts of climate change.

It was passed on by the inspector general.\u201d However, the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) of 1998 explicitly\u00a0requires\u00a0an official concerned about wrongdoing within the government to go to the IC inspector general before the congressional panels in charge of oversight of the intelligence community. \u2026 The CIA whistleblower in question went to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff\u2019s office\u00a0days\u00a0before the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, the internal investigator, and watchdog. Investigators from the office of the IC IG are expected to operate independently of political leadership in government.",

It\u2019s harmful,\u201d she continued, adding that Trump\u2019s purported \u201cbigotry\u201d is \u201creflective\u201d his \u201cwhite supremacist base.\u201d  The \u201cSquad\u201d ringleader tweeted an article from The Intercept, which\u00a0bizarrely\u00a0accused the president of launching antisemitic attacks against the notorious anti-Trump lawmaker, who is largely driving the partisan impeachment effort. \u201cOn October 2, Trump escalated his brazenly\u00a0anti-Semitic attack on Schiff,\u201d The Intercept claimed before quoting Trump. \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t call him \u2018Shifty Schiff\u2019 for nothing,\u201d Trump said of Schiff, calling him a \u201cshifty, dishonest guy.\u201d  The outlet claimed that Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201cshifty\u201d is an antisemitic attack \u2013 suggesting that Jews are \u201csneaky and manipulative\u201d \u2013 rather than a simple play on his last name. The outlet also accuses Donald Trump Jr. of being in on the \u201cattack,\u201d participating by linking Schiff to the notorious left-wing billionaire George Soros:  The Intercept wrote: Don Jr.\u2019s tweets provoked a rare response from Jonathan Greenblatt, head of the Anti-Defamation League, who referred to his invocation of Soros, a left-leaning Jewish billionaire, as an \u201canti-Semitic trope\u201d and a \u201cdangerous\u201d insinuation. Despite The Intercept\u2019s claims, there is no evidence that Trump\u2019s critiques of Schiff are antisemitic in nature. Schiff is largely driving the Democrat impeachment effort alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). He remains a controversial figure, particularly following a week of bombshells. It was revealed this week that Schiff knew of the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint \u2013\u00a0a complaint based entirely on hearsay, not firsthand knowledge \u2013\u00a0days before it was formally filed. The \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d who was revealed to be a registered Democrat, took his accusations to a House Intelligence Committee aide, who relayed the information to Schiff. The revelation called Schiff\u2019s September 17 claims into question. He told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe that \u201cwe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower\u201d:  A committee spokesperson\u00a0told\u00a0the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0that Schiff \u201cintended to answer the question of whether the Committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not\u201d and added that Schiff \u201cacknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased.\u201d Despite that, the Post\u00a0gave\u00a0Schiff Four Pinocchios. House Democrats \u2013 at the lead of\u00a0Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY), and Schiff \u2013 subpoenaed the White House on Friday over documents related to the Ukraine investigation. The White House signaled that it would not comply with requests until the House held a full vote on the impeachment inquiry. Schiff said on Thursday that House Democrats may have to proceed with impeachment without being able to \u201cflesh out the facts.\u201d \u201cAnd there may very well come a point where we have to make the decision that the effort to obstruct has become such an impediment that we have reached a decision point \u2014 even in the absence of being able to fully follow and flesh out the facts surrounding the president\u2019s Ukraine conduct,\u201d Schiff said during an appearance at Northwestern University.",

      "content": " Watch the video for yourself, but this time pay special attention to Ocasio-Crazy\u2019s demonic and demented reaction to some crazy woman howling about how eating dead people is not enough.  By the way, the idea of eating dead people to save the world from Climate Change is no joke. Just last month at something called the Gastro Summit, Swedish\u00a0behavioral scientist Magnus S\u00f6derlund\u00a0did a whole PowerPoint presentation arguing we must \u201covercome our taboo against cannibalism\u201d and eat our own dead to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability. The woman at Ocasio-Crazy\u2019s town hall was only taking this idea to the next logical step, a step that combines cannibalism with the Democrats\u2019 utter disregard for newborn babies. The Democrat party is now openly pro-infanticide, openly okay with slaughtering a child post-birth, so why not go for the two-fer? Hey, eating the baby not only aborts it, it\u2019s one less carbon-emitting feast for the whole family! Returning to this sick and twisted loon we call AOC\u2026 How difficult would it have been for her to show a little moral leadership and say, \u201cYou know, we\u2019re not going to eat babies, okay?\u201d Instead, and this is a direct transcript, she says to the woman: \u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d Then, while looking Eat-The-Baby-Lady right in the eye, she again says \u201cThank you,\u201d and treats the question as a serious proposal: \u201cYeah, no, so, one of the things that\u2019s very important to us is that we need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present.\u201d What\u2019s more, it is not as though Ocasio-Crazy is patronizing Eat-The-Baby-Lady to settle her down or something, because Ocasio-Crazy does look directly at her and correct her on one point: \u201cLuckily we have more than a few months,\u201d she says, adding, \u201cBut we do need to hit net-zero in several years, but I think we all need to understand that there are a lot of solutions we have, that we can pursue, and that if we act in a positive way there\u2019s space for hope. We are never beyond hope.\u201d So Ocasio-Crazy is willing to hit the buzzer when Eat-The-Baby-Lady gets the timeline wrong, but not on the whole eat-the-babies thing. Laugh away, but 15-years-ago you would have laughed away at the idea of same-sex marriage, of the idea of biological men competing in women\u2019s sports, of your daughter being forced to share a bathroom with a mentally-ill man in a dress, of a CNN anchor arguing there\u2019s something wrong with a little girl made uncomfortable after being exposed to a biological man\u2019s penis in the girl\u2019s locker room. Today\u2019s left is openly celebrating socialism, openly condones post-birth abortions, openly cheers the assassination of police officers, and openly supports and encourages the jack-booted terrorists called Antifa. AOC herself is an open socialist and she basically runs the Democrat Party. And now, the head of the Democrat Party is so warped, so morally illiterate, her only response to eat babies to save Gaia is \u201cThank you \u2026 we need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present.\u201d She couldn\u2019t even bring herself to say, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to eat babies.\u201d The Democrat Party is now at a point where it won\u2019t take a stand against eating babies.

She ran in 2018 on a pledge to end the war in Syria and elsewhere: \u201cAlexandria believes that we must end the \u201cforever war\u201d by bringing our troops home, and ending the air strikes that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism throughout the world,\u201d her 2018 campaign website\u00a0said: Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the United States has entangled itself in war and occupation throughout the Middle East and North Africa. As of 2018, we are currently involved in military action in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia. Hundreds of thousands of civilians in these countries have been killed either as collateral damage from American strikes or from the instability caused by U.S. interventions. Millions more have fled their broken countries, contributing to the global refugee crisis.\n\n\u2026 According to the Constitution, the right to declare war belongs to the legislative body, and yet many of these global acts of aggression have never once been voted on by Congress. In some cases, we\u2019ve even acted unilaterally, without the backing of the United Nations. America should not be in the business of destabilizing countries. While we may see ourselves as liberators, the world increasingly views us as occupiers and aggressors. Alexandria believes that we must end the \u201cforever war\u201d by bringing our troops home, and ending the air strikes that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism throughout the world. By bringing our troops home, we can begin to heal the wounds we\u2019re opening by continuing military engagement. We can begin to repair our image. We can reunite military families, separated by repeated deployments. We can become stronger by building stronger diplomatic and economic ties, and by saving our armed forces only for when they\u2019re truly needed. In addition, Ocasio-Cortez has repeatedly used her widely-followed Twitter account to attack U.S. wars in Syria and elsewhere:           Ocasio-Cortez did not provide an alternative solution for Syria, or for Kurdish security, or relations with Turkey.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The group \u2014 under the leadership of the chair, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, and chair-elect, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti \u2014 announced its support for the Green New Deal on a worldwide scale, arguing that it is necessary to\u00a0\u201cdrive an urgent, fundamental and irreversible transfer of global resources away from fossil fuels and into action that averts the climate emergency.\u201d The group boasted of \u201c94 climate leader cities\u201d recognizing the \u201cglobal climate emergency.\u201d Per the release: The message was issued by city leaders attending the C40 World Mayors Summit in Copenhagen. Their call came in response to intergovernmental action being blocked by a minority of very powerful, science-denying governments, representing the interests of the fossil-fuel industry. Through the Global Green New Deal, cities have reaffirmed their commitment to protecting our environment, strengthening our economy, and building a more equitable future by cutting emissions from the sectors most responsible for the climate crisis \u2014 transportation, buildings, industry, and waste \u2014 to keep global heating below the 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement. The city leaders called to cut global emissions by 50 percent by 2030, an effort the United States has already led the charge on despite a lack of participation in the Paris Agreement. Carbon emissions from energy usage from the U.S. are at the lowest levels since 1992, as Breitbart News\u2019s entertainment editor and author of 50 Things They Don\u2019t Want You to Know, Jermone Hudson, told Fox & Friends last month. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report last year, which indicated that greenhouse gas emissions decreased during Trump\u2019s first year in office. As Breitbart News reported: The EPA report revealed that total greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 2.7 percent from 2016 to 2017. \u201cThanks to President Trump\u2019s regulatory reform agenda, the economy is booming, energy production is surging, and we are reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major industrial sources,\u201d EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. \u201cThese achievements flow largely from technological breakthroughs in the private sector, not the heavy hand of government. The Trump Administration has proven that federal regulations are not necessary to drive CO2 reductions,\u201d Wheeler continued. \u201cWhile many around the world are talking about reducing greenhouse gases, the U.S. continues to deliver, and today\u2019s report is further evidence of our action-oriented approach.\u201d \u201cAs mayors our first priority is to protect the safety of our citizens,\u201d Hidago said.\u00a0\u201cIt will soon be four years since the Paris Agreement was signed in our city.\u201d \u201cWorld leaders met in New York just last month and once again failed to agree anything close to the level of action necessary to stop the climate crisis,\u201d she continued, decrying their \u201cineptitude\u201d and proclaiming that it \u201cdirectly threatens all people around the globe as time keeps running against us.\u201d \u201cThere is no other solution but a Global Green New Deal to be the pivotal instrument to win this race against the clock. All decision-makers must take responsibility in making it a reality,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen it comes to climate action, no one is doing more than cities, but no one is doing enough,\u201d Garcetti concurred. \u201cWe are entering a make-or-break decade for the preservation of our planet and environmental justice for every community \u2014 and I am proud to lead C40 cities at this critical moment,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether we will continue leading the drive to protect the world and promote a better, more equitable life for everyone living in it,\u201d he added. Freshman \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) also released a statement, praising the coalition and calling climate change \u201cour greatest threat.\u201d \u201cI am inspired by this coalition and the commitments made for a global Green New Deal,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we work to join forces globally, we will be able to defeat our greatest threat and realize our greatest opportunity.\u201d \u201cFederal govs are failing to act on the climate crisis,\u201d she followed up in a tweet. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for others to lead\u201d: ",

ACTA says that its annual\u00a0What Will They Learn? report,\u00a0\u201cuniquely assesses the core academic requirements at 1,123 four-year institutions that together enroll more than eight million undergraduate students,\u201d and that it scores the institutions based on whether they require all students to take courses in seven \u201cpriority subject areas.\u201d According to the organization, only 22\u00a0institutions earned an \u201cA\u201d\u00a0for core curriculum requirements, and 137 schools failed. \u201cWhile most universities require students to take courses in composition and the natural sciences, curricular gaps are common everywhere else,\u201d said ACTA in a statement. 82% do not require students to take a foundational course in U.S. government or history.\n\n43% do not require students to take a college-level mathematics course.\n\n68% do not require students to study literature.\n\n88% do not require intermediate-level foreign language courses.\n\n97% do not require a course in economics. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that public confidence in higher education is falling,\u201d said Poliakoff. \u201cAmidst all the fanfare about the release of the latest college rankings this week, there is not a peep about ill-informed citizens, often underprepared for the workforce, who are graduating from our colleges and universities with mountains of student debt.\u201d \u201cBy focusing on resource inputs, admissions selectivity, and institutional reputation, the major rankings systems drive costs up but show little interest in what students learn \u2014 or don\u2019t learn,\u201d he added.

      "content": " The freshman lawmaker delivered a speech at the summit this week and emotionally declared that her dreams of motherhood \u201ctaste bittersweet\u201d because of climate change and the impact it will have on \u201cour children\u2019s future.\u201d \u201cI speak to you not as an elected official or public figure. But I speak to you as a human being,\u201d she began. \u201cA woman whose dreams of motherhood now taste bittersweet because of what I know about our children\u2019s future and that our actions are responsible for bringing their most dire possibilities into focus,\u201d she continued, audibly holding back tears. \u201cI speak to you as a daughter and descendant of colonized peoples who have already begun to suffer,\u201d she added, citing the thousands of Puerto Rican lives lost due to Hurricane Maria, which she described as a \u201cclimate change powered storm.\u201d She said her grandfather died in the aftermath along with others, all because\u00a0\u201cthey were living under colonial rule, which contributed to the dire conditions and lack of recovery.\u201d Dozens of C40 mayors\u00a0called for a \u201cGlobal Green New Deal\u201d to address the mounting environmental concerns. \u201cAs mayors our first priority is to protect the safety of our citizens,\u201d C40 chair, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said.\u00a0\u201cIt will soon be four years since the Paris Agreement was signed in our city.\u201d \u201cWorld leaders met in New York just last month and once again failed to agree anything close to the level of action necessary to stop the climate crisis,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere is no other solution but a Global Green New Deal to be the pivotal instrument to win this race against the clock. All decision-makers must take responsibility in making it a reality,\u201d she added. This is far from the first time the socialist lawmaker has painted a dark picture of the future over concerns related to climate change. She told viewers during a live video on social media in August that she wants to \u201cperhaps have one less child\u201d due to the looming threat. \u201cEven now, you know, when you put climate change on top of that, I know that I want to perhaps have one less child than I thought I would maybe have,\u201d she explained. \u201cI think having a mixed family is part of my personal planning. But it\u2019s really hard, and I don\u2019t think sometimes that older generations understand how much we\u2019re taking this into account,\u201d she added: On Instagram live just now, AOC says she's going to have one less child because of climate change. pic.twitter.com/qUess81XPi \u2014 Caleb SkHull \u1f48\ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b (@CalebJHull) August 28, 2019 ",

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres flew from U.N. headquarters in New York to deliver a 20 minute address of his own to the municipal leaders on Friday. He urged voters and lawmakers to pressure governments to fight climate change and achieve carbon neutrality. \u201cToday, we can see businesses, cities and society moving faster than governments are,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s very important to go on putting as much pressure as possible on governments to make sure that they always, they always, all of them, accept our carbon neutrality objective.\u201d The mayors promised to create a Global Youth Initiative to help deliver a Global Green New Deal. \u201cIt is not even about a specific piece of legislation, it is about a global change of values, ideals, and ways of relating to each other and the Earth,\u201d said Jamie Margolin, Zero Hour founder and co-executive director.

      "subtitle": "Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is out with a new book, The Case Against Socialism, and explained his case and vision in a lengthy exclusive interview on Sirius XM\u2019s Breitbart News Sunday this weekend.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " In the interview, Paul said that from Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime in Germany to Josef Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union to Mao Zedong\u2019s China to Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba to Pol Pot\u2019s Cambodia to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s Venezuela, socialism has worse than failed in every single country it has been attempted. And while he says that modern American socialists like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) claim \u201cthey don\u2019t want that kind of socialism\u201d that results in \u201cauthoritarianism, genocide, and famine,\u201d there is no case where socialism has ever worked and it always ends up there. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the questions that comes up very quickly is some people are incredulous you even have to make the case because history is replete with examples of socialism gone awry, socialism devolving into authoritarianism, genocide, and famine,\u201d Paul said in a half-hour special that aired Sunday evening on Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel. \u201cThe 20th century really is the history of the failure of socialism, from Hitler\u2019s Nazi or nationalist socialism to Stalin\u2019s Bolshevik socialism to Mao\u2019s socialism to Pol Pot. Really, time and time again, millions of people have died at the hands of despotic rulers,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSome would say today\u2019s socialists like AOC and Bernie don\u2019t want that kind of socialism, but actually there was a time when Bernie was very sympathetic to Castro as well as Ch\u00e1vez. This seems to be the pattern for today\u2019s socialists is that they\u2019re very, very open to socialism until they find out that it\u2019s replaced by authoritarianism and until they find out it\u2019s been replaced by poverty.\u201d Paul points to Venezuela as a key recent historical example of socialism \u201cgone awry.\u201d \u201cThis is true in Venezuela in particular,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAll the American left was in love, even people who didn\u2019t claim to be socialists, were in love Ch\u00e1vez and claimed he was reducing poverty, but in the end in Venezuela it\u2019s become so desperate that the average person has lost 20 pounds not because they intended to but for lack of food. Venezuela was once one of the richest countries\u2014probably the richest country\u2014in South America. They still have more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, but there\u2019s still shortages of food. The common people can\u2019t eat. You see people like their leader, Maduro\u2014their socialist leader\u2014becoming more and more overweight; he\u2019s probably added something like 50 pounds while the average person is losing 20 pounds. So I think you see example after example of socialism not working and devolving into state violence, but I think even more important though is we now\u2014you think most people would know that, but what we have now is polls showing people today, especially youth, think socialism might be a good idea. You have some polls showing over 50 percent of young people thinking we ought to try socialism. So my wife and I got together and wrote this book thinking gosh, we have to remind them of the history of socialism, but we also have to remind them that socialism historically has also devolved into violence.\u201d Socialism, Paul argues, has taken over the Democrat Party, fueled by an angry presidential primary battle that has resulted in a \u201cbidding war\u201d of sorts between that party\u2019s leaders attempting to outdo each other. \u201cI think it\u2019s become a kind of a bidding war among the presidential candidates on the Democrat side,\u201d Paul said. \u201cOne person will offer free college, and the other person will say, \u2018No, free college and free benefits for paid leave,\u2019 and then another one will say, \u2018What about Medicare for All?\u2019 So it just goes on and on and on, in sort of a bidding war on the left for who can offer more free stuff. But there needs to be an examination of who really pays for so-called \u2018free stuff.\u2019 This is one of the big lies we point out in The Case Against Socialism, is that Bernie and AOC say, \u2018Oh the top one percent will pay for all this.\u2019 But when you add it up, there\u2019s just not enough money. What they have proposed on the top one percent would maybe bring in $50 billion, but their spending desires are closer to $60, $70, or even $80 trillion. So there\u2019s definitely a mismatch and a math problem for these people.\u201d In addition to the mathematical and historical issues with socialism, Paul argues, current socialists using Scandinavian countries like Denmark and Sweden to argue socialism works are false analogies. \u201cBut even worse, they point to the so-called socialism of Scandinavia and say, \u2018Oh yeah, we used to like Ch\u00e1vez, we used to like Castro, we used to like the Sandinistas, but now what we really like is Scandinavian socialism,\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cSo we examine that, my wife and I did a great deal of research and we examined Scandinavian socialism and what we came up with is interestingly they are not socialist. They have private property; most of the businesses are owned privately. They have a private stock exchange. In fact, the prime minister of Denmark when Bernie kept saying, \u2018Denmark is this great socialist nation,\u2019 the prime minister actually came out and said, \u2018Bernie, you need to pipe down; we\u2019re not a socialist country.\u2019 In fact, he almost got alarm in his voice because he was worried people might not come there to do business anymore because they might think they were a socialist nation. Most of the indexes of freedom, trade, and capitalism actually rank the Scandinavian countries quite high. So really what Bernie is selling is a bill of goods here. They will then argue that the Scandinavian countries have a lot of free stuff\u2014they do have a lot of free stuff, welfare, and state goodies that come with big government, but the interesting thing with Scandinavia is it\u2019s much different than Bernie and AOC say. What happens in Scandinavia is the working class pay a huge amount of taxes. The working class pay a 25 percent sales tax on everything, including food, and the working class and middle class also pay income tax, whereas many in our country on the lower end are excluded from the income tax, whereas what you find over there is even at $60,000 you have a 60 percent income tax. So, really, I think it\u2019s important that we explode the myths of American socialists that Scandinavia is socialist but also explode the myth that you can have all this free stuff and the only people that pay are the top one percent in America. There\u2019s just not enough money, and it\u2019s just not true.\u201d Paul is troubled by a rising interest in socialism among America\u2019s youth, as evidenced by some increased support for the radical and failed ideology in recent polling, and is concerned that American young people are not learning this history in school. While he thinks some of it is just a natural tradition of Americans being more leftist when they are young and becoming more conservative as they get older, he is concerned that some of what is happening is due to a lack of education on the historical failures of socialism and misconception about what socialism really entails\u2014government control of the means of production. \u201cI think there\u2019s always been a trend for young people to be more liberal\u2014or more open to socialism\u2014you know the old saying was, \u2018If you don\u2019t believe in liberal policies before age 30 you don\u2019t have a heart, but if you don\u2019t believe in conservative polices after age 30 you don\u2019t have a brain,\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cThere is some truth to it. When you\u2019re younger, you live on your parents\u2019 dole. In many ways, you are a dependent who has not necessarily seen the working world or seen what it\u2019s like and seen that paying taxes is necessary. So I do think people become more conservative over time. It\u2019s also true that the polls that show younger people and millennials leaning toward socialism, when they ask these young people \u2018What is socialism?\u2019 only 16 or 17 percent of them can actually answer what socialism is and socialism is traditionally defined as the state owning the means of production and you don\u2019t have private property\u2014there is collective ownership of things. For most young people, if they\u2019re just reading one sentence on Twitter, I guess they\u2019re not reading much history. Some of it is a misconception, but some of it also is a function of our schools in that I think there\u2019s a sort of unified groupthink in schools that teaches kids that things are sort of unfair out there and that it\u2019s a rotten world and the government is going to make things more equal and more fair. So I think some of them want to see government-enforced equality, but we make the case in The Case Against Socialism that if you want equality of outcomes you would have to have equality police.\u201d Paul further explains the left\u2019s hypocrisy when it comes to a \u201cfairness police\u201d that he says would be necessary under a socialist system to ensure \u201cequal outcome\u201d by noting that it cuts against core American beliefs of \u201cequal protection under the law.\u201d \u201cYou would have to have a fairness police that is going to show up with truncheons to make people fair again because any time you sort of advocate for equal outcome you basically push to make everyone equal all the time, the world is not that way,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou have unequal talents, some people work harder than others, some people are luckier, some people are taller, some people are smarter, some people are faster\u2014there\u2019s all kinds of reasons why there are not equal outcomes. But the irony is if you want to have equal outcomes the law and the government actually has to treat people unequally. You think the left would think this through, and they would realize that the whole idea of equal protection under the law\u2014that everybody should be treated the same\u2014is a principle that the left prided themselves in and almost everyone prides themselves in now and yet if you have equal outcomes you won\u2019t have equal protection under the law. You actually will have to law that will treat people in an unequal way.\u201d Part of why Paul said there is a rush to socialism in America\u2019s youth is a legitimate concern with political corruption in America, something grassroots movements on both the left and the right have felt for many years. There is, he said, a political, cultural, and financial elite that seems to ordinary Americans to be above the rest of society when it comes to the law and because of that corruption people challenge the system\u2014on both sides of the political aisle. He is concerned, however, that the left\u2019s pandering with socialism would only make the system worse because it would empower more cronyism and more corruption if ever implemented, whereas conservatives\u2019 vision of less government cuts into the ability of bad actors to act badly. \u201cI think you\u2019ve hit the nail on the head. Both left and right, the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movement, they\u2019re all sort of unhappy about\u2014myself included\u2014about crony capitalism, about people who manipulate government and manipulate the law to have an unfair advantage,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that they\u2019re selling something that people want and have become successful like Sam Walton, it\u2019s things like some of the big pharmaceutical companies and things that come to Washington and manipulate government to enrich themselves and then abuse the rules to enrich themselves more and more. So yes I think both sides\u2014both right and left\u2014see this. I remember when the bankers were bailed out in 2009, these very wealthy bankers and very wealthy banks that had made rotten decisions. In the end, the poor homeowner was kicked out of his house or her house but the banks were bailed out. So the Occupy Wall Street movement was offended by that and so was the Tea Party. The real difference is the answer. It\u2019s one thing to be angry about crony capitalism. For those on the left, it\u2019s because crony capitalism is a failure they think we should try socialism. For those of us on the right, or the Tea Party movement, we look at crony capitalism and say that\u2019s too much government\u2014that\u2019s people abusing government.\u201d Paul added that the right\u2019s vision is more effective in solving the problems of corruption because it takes the power away from that handful of people who would wield it dishonorably. And that is exactly the problem with socialism, he said, as evidenced by all its historical failures: Bad actors rise up and inevitably wield said power unfairly in what ends up benefitting the few at the top and screwing over the many throughout society. \u201cWe decided that what we wanted was less government, more of a government restrained and restricted and limited by the Constitution and less crony capitalism in a sense that what we wanted to inject was more of a free market and more voluntary transactions,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSo it is sort of ironic that both right and left are both motivated by the same problem we see, and they come up with very different solutions and I think that\u2019s why the book we have The Case Against Socialism is so important is because it\u2019s about choices. It\u2019s about voters in our country who get to think about what kind of economic system we want. And I guess our point in the book is we don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accident that throughout history every time socialism has been tried it has wound up in genocide and famine. The stories from Mao\u2019s China, the stories from Pol Pot in Cambodia, the stories currently from Venezuela, I mean they are horrifying stories. People are eating their pets in Venezuela. People need to know this. The other side will complain and say that\u2019s not real socialism, that\u2019s a bunch of kleptocrats. And yet that\u2019s the people who are elected, that\u2019s their party label\u2014they are from the socialist party\u2014and again the apologists for socialism say \u2018oh that\u2019s not what we really want. These people now are just thugs.\u2019 But why is it time and time again socialism devolves into thuggery? So, I think this is an important and timely book and I hope it will get the readership necessary to shape and influence some of the next generation.\u201d Paul added that he\u2019s looked at experts and historical analysis to question whether socialism inevitably ends up in authoritarian regimes intent on genocide and famine, or if that just keeps happening accidentally. He argues that the experts like Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek have examined this very question and found that under socialism, ruthlessness prevails in leadership and violence becomes necessary for implementation. \u201cPeople keep getting back to this idea of whether it\u2019s an inevitability to have this kind of authoritarianism and violence or whether it\u2019s an accident,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHayek and others looked at this, and they said it shouldn\u2019t be looked at as a one-off or accidental in history that socialism devolves into violence because if you ultimately want to collectivize the farms as Mao did or Stalin did, if you want to take property from people, there is a point at which they will resist. Really, the leader that exhibits that most ruthless character is the one who\u2019s able to take the land because it ultimately does require, as Lenin and others said, you\u2019ve got to break a few eggs to make an omelette. The thing is is ultimately this is what happens. You end up choosing a few leaders; they get selected by the rest of the socialists because they are the most ruthless and willing to actually use the violence necessary to take the property. But really, our kids need to learn this history and read about it. Pol Pot was not that long ago in Cambodia with the killing fields and just hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of bodies piled in mass graves. In a very short period of time they expelled virtually everybody from the cities and ultimately millions of people were killed. This is the kind of thing that people say, \u2018Oh that\u2019s not what I want.\u2019\u201d But, Paul argues, if Americans vote for socialist leadership, what ultimately happens next is evident throughout history. \u201cBut if you\u2019re for socialism, if you\u2019re for the collectivization of ownership, if you believe that the collective is more important than the individual, ultimately this is what happens,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think the individual is important and you disdain individual rights, then it\u2019s sort of like it\u2019s okay to have drone-like slaves because then what you\u2019re about is the hive and you\u2019re not really concerned about the individual. Our country was founded on something completely different, individual liberty. Our bill of rights is directed toward individuals not toward classifications and these are important traditions but I think it\u2019s not being taught in school. Today\u2019s sort of Twitter society is short attention span and not reading. I think it\u2019s important to have the ammunition out there and we\u2019re hoping that The Case Against Socialism will be that ammunition to help people make an informed decision and hopefully prevent America, as President Trump said, from ever becoming a socialist nation.\u201d Before Paul\u2019s interview with Breitbart News, he had appeared on The View opposite, among others, Ana Navarro\u2014the frequent critic of President Donald Trump\u2014who shut Paul down when he was explaining what socialism was and why it was bad and why it failed in Venezuela. Paul, when asked about Navarro\u2019s silencing of him, told Breitbart News that exposing socialism does not fit Navarro\u2019s \u201cnarrative\u201d of hateful opposition to President Trump\u2014something shared by the other hosts of The View\u2014so she would rather just not discuss these inconvenient truths at all. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really fit their narrative,\u201d Paul said. \u201cPeople like Ana Navarro hate President Trump and they blame everything and they blame the poor dialogue and crassness in Washington and crass dialogue between right and left\u2014they blame it all on the president, and yet really people like Ana Navarro and others on The View who shout and scream over everybody, really they\u2019re adding to that poor dialogue. They\u2019re setting a poor example for everyone with the sort of yelling and screaming, but the particular point we were trying to explain to her was the leaders in Venezuela are socialist. The leaders of their party identify as the socialist party. She was like, \u2018No they\u2019re thugs, they\u2019re thugs. They\u2019re not socialists.\u2019 And I tried to calmly make the point to her that, well, they are socialists and they are thugs\u2014and that\u2019s precisely our point. When the government is controlled centrally by a few people, by one political party\u2014the socialists\u2014and you get central planning where you don\u2019t have the freedom to decide what and how much to produce and consumers don\u2019t get to choose, when a few people control things, you have much more of a susceptibility to kleptocracy, to thieves, to stealing and lying and enriching yourselves.\u201d Paul added that leftist anti-Trump personalities like Navarro \u201cdemean themselves\u201d by opposing allowing \u201cintelligent debate\u201d on these issues. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps happening [socialism failing] over and over again, and that\u2019s what she doesn\u2019t understand and so many on the left refuse to understand is that there is a tendency or maybe even something that is inherent to socialism that leads to thuggery,\u201d Paul said. \u201cPeople like her don\u2019t want to see the lessons of Mao, the lessons of Stalin, the lessons of Hitler\u2014they weren\u2019t accidents of history, they were the natural conclusion of socialism. Maduro and Ch\u00e1vez are the natural conclusion to socialism. Then she was like, \u2018Oh, President Trump is misusing this and saying that if the Democrats win you\u2019ll get socialism.\u2019 Then I said, and I don\u2019t think she liked it, I said, \u2018You know, if you vote for a socialist you might get socialism.\u2019 And it\u2019s like really? That sounds obvious to me. Bernie says he is a socialist\u2014I think we\u2019d get socialism [if he wins]. AOC says she\u2019s a socialist. I would think we might socialism if these people ever get in charge of the government. So it\u2019s sort of a bizarre situation, but they sort of demean themselves by being intolerant of allowing intelligent debate.\u201d While much of the interview focused on the issues of socialism and Sanders in particular, Paul added that the new Democrat frontrunner Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is really no different than Sanders when it comes to socialist ideology\u2014just that she\u2019s better at hiding it from the public than Sanders which is why she\u2019s ascendant in the polls. \u201cI think there\u2019s really not a dime\u2019s worth of difference between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThey stand for the same policies and ultimately hers is a socialist platform also. You\u2019re right, though, she\u2019s like most liberals of the last several decades where they were always smart to try to hide their socialism from the public. And I think in the end, most of the major policies that have come out\u2014Elizabeth Warren has rushed to support. So I don\u2019t know that you can claim, maintain, or support that there\u2019s much of a difference in policies between Bernie Sanders\u2019 socialism and Elizabeth Warren.\u201d What\u2019s particularly troubling, though, Paul said, is the evidence that socialism has won the day inside the Democrat Party as a whole. Ocasio-Cortez is now calling the shots and really running the House of Representatives now, not Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as evidenced by the Democrats\u2019 lunging towards impeachment of President Trump. How the media and political class have gone after President Trump, versus the kid glove treatment of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, is exactly the kind of unfair double standard that Paul argues leads people to question the fairness of the political and economic system in America. \u201cI think they\u2019re off the reservation now as far as impeachment goes,\u201d Paul said. \u201c[Pelosi] announced she was for it before she saw any transcripts of the phone call. And, the way I see it is I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody from either party who hasn\u2019t threatened Ukraine\u2019s aid and told them they have to investigate corruption. [Former Vice President Joe] Biden was there threatening it years ago, if they didn\u2019t quit investigating his son\u2019s company\u2014the company that was paying him $50,000 a month\u2014I think most Americans, when they hear that, just on the face of it, that some 30-year-old kid is on the board of an international company getting $50,000 a month, and his dad is traveling to Ukraine all the time, and his dad sort of tells them, \u2018Guess what, you get no more money unless you fire this prosecutor.\u2019 The prosecutor has actually now testified that he was investigating the company that was paying Hunter Biden. It just doesn\u2019t pass the smell test. People are going to wonder and say, \u2018Well, Pelosi is going to impeach the president over accusations he did something like this even though it doesn\u2019t sound like he was willing to trade or do anything.\u2019 But even if the accusations were accurate, they sound very similar to what Biden\u2019s been accused of but yet nobody blinked an eye or accused Biden of doing something untoward that he should be impeached for. But I think the American people ultimately do want fairness, and they\u2019re going to balk at treating Trump differently than Biden is treated. So if the American people perceive the actions of both to be similar, but that the Democrats are only willing to go after a Republican, I think it ends up becoming a partisan thing that I think people in the end are going to think was motivated by politics not by principle or justice.\u201d Paul added that this double standard is exactly why Americans on both sides of the aisle are \u201cdisturbed\u201d by America\u2019s political, financial, and cultural elites. He also explained that the ultimate irony of all this kleptocracy by the Bidens is that it has cleared the way for the rise of Warren, a socialist herself, and the question is whether she will be able to sufficiently hide her socialism. \u201cPeople get disturbed by it on both sides,\u201d Paul said. \u201cReally, they get disturbed by what\u2019s going on. But, I think really that ultimately it\u2019s going to be very, very hard and the irony is that while they thought this was going to bring Trump down, the irony is this is bringing Biden down. His numbers were already falling because he doesn\u2019t seem to be on the ball as much as he used to, he doesn\u2019t seem to have maybe what it takes to intellectually get through the questions of the day during the debates, and so I think that was already bringing him down but the association with the scandal and his son and all the money that went to his son, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s bringing him down. I agree with you that Elizabeth Warren is surging to the top, and the question will be: Will she run away from all the stuff she supports with Bernie, ultimately, or will the tag of socialism and the stain of socialism stick to her as well? We plan on being out there and talking about socialism over the next year and making the actual positions of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are well known and that the disaster of socialism is something our kids will hopefully know enough about to resist it.\u201d LISTEN TO RAND PAUL ON BREITBART NEWS SUNDAY: ",

Topping the spending list was former Vice President Joe Biden, who dropped about $924,000 on private air travel \u2026 South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg spent nearly $479,000 on private flights over the past three months, up from roughly $300,000 in the second quarter. And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) used about $253,000 in campaign cash to charter flights, significantly more than the $17,000 she spent in the second quarter. The Democratic primary field\u2019s leading progressives, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), also saw their private air travel spending swell in the three-month fundraising period. \u2026 Other candidates who dropped campaign cash on private flights include Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who spent about $40,500; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who spent about $23,000; and former tech executive Andrew Yang, who spent just under $26,000. Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, Sanders, Warren, Klobuchar, and Yang all support the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d a plan introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in February that calls for the elimination of fossil fuels by 2030. Of those listed above, only Bullock opposes the plan, calling it \u201cresolution aspiration\u201d at the second debate. A typical private jet flight on a Cessna Citation XLS jet seating seven passengers would burn just under one ton of carbon per person \u2014 about 20% of the average\u00a0annual global per capita consumption, and about one third of what the\u00a0total annual per capita consumption of carbon ought to be, according to\u00a0calculations by the Sierra Club in 2015.

His signature followed a September\u00a0House Oversight subcommittee hearing featuring a 16-year-old Honduran boy battling cystic fibrosis, who told lawmakers he feared he would die if he had to go back to his country.

Warren\u2019s campaign has a consistent habit of exaggerating its crowd sizes; Biden rarely draws large crowds. Though Warren now leads in many national polls of Democratic party presidential primary voters, especially in the states that will vote first, Sanders is still clinging to his spot among the three frontrunners, together with former Vice President Joe Biden. He used the rally to send the message that he has recovered from a heart attack just two weeks before.

      "author": "Kristina Wong",
      "content": " Paul, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate and prominent libertarian, said he remembers in the 1970s and 1980s when Americans would never admit to being socialists, let alone a liberal. Today, he said, Democrats are openly running on socialist platforms, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). \u201cIt\u2019s kind of mind-boggling, actually,\u201d he said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cWe now live in a time where not only are people talking about socialism, they\u2019re proudly running as a socialist.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s important for this generation to realize what socialism was in the last century\u00a0and how [it] really invariably was associated with violence, with genocide, with famine, with horrible tragedy and you know, today\u2019s youth seems to have forgotten that,\u201d he said. He said in China, as many as 40 million died during the Great Famine in the late 1950s, and today, in Venezuela, people are eating their pets. \u201cThat is the end result of socialism, there is no food in the stores,\u201d he said. \u201cVenezuela has more oil than any other country in the world, they have more oil than Saudi Arabia, they were one of the richest countries, and now they\u2019re in calamitous poverty.\u201d His book tells the story of a young woman in Venezuela in a gang that controls territory \u2014 six dumpsters where they can search for food. \u201cHow did they get there?\u00a0It\u2019s almost, it\u2019s mind-boggling. How do you even explain it?\u201d he said. He said he does not think America is ready for socialism, but pointed out that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) \u2014 who does not call herself a socialist but is running on socialist policies \u2014 appears to be the Democrat frontrunner. \u201cThe socialist doesn\u2019t win, but the person who has all the same policies who doesn\u2019t call herself a socialist, Elizabeth Warren, and right now is looking like the frontrunner, but she\u2019s for most of the policies that Bernie Sanders is for and so that will be the question, will we elect someone with socialist policies?\u201d he said. Paul debunked the myth that there is socialism in Scandinavia. \u201cThey\u2019re not socialist in Scandinavia. They have private property, they have a private stock market, they don\u2019t even have a minimum wage, prices go up and down, but they do have a big welfare state. So while they\u2019re not socialist they have a big welfare state. They do have free college, free paid leave, all these sort of welfare goodies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt turns out in Scandinavia, the way they pay for free college and all this so-called free stuff is they tax the working class, and the middle class, extensively, so there\u2019s a 25 percent sales tax, they call it a VAT, it\u2019s on food, clothing, everything, you name it. Twenty-five percent so everybody pays that, including the poor. So that\u2019s a pretty significant tax \u2014 25 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also have an income tax that\u2019s 60 percent starting at $60,000. That\u2019s way higher than the United States. So the dirty little secret of Scandinavia is you can have a welfare state but everybody\u2019s got to pay taxes,\u201d he said. He said back in the U.S., Warren is promising Medicare-for-all without saying whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it. \u201cShe won\u2019t answer the question. Now Bernie has, he said we\u2019ll raise taxes on the middle class but they\u2019ll save money on their healthcare cause it\u2019ll be \u2018free,'\u201d he said. \u201cWell Elizabeth Warren won\u2019t answer that question, I think that\u2019s going to be an important question for her, and we\u2019ll see, and even the left and the establishment media and the left are going, \u2018Elizabeth, how are you going to pay for this?\u2019 and I think she\u2019s boxed in a corner and eventually she\u2019s going to have to admit \u2014 with massive middle class taxes.\u201d  Follow Breitbart News\u2019s\u00a0@Kristina_Wong.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The New York lawmaker formally endorsed Sanders at a \u201cBernie\u2019s Back Rally\u201d in New York on Saturday, crediting him for helping her recognize her\u00a0\u201cinherent value as a human being who deserves health care, housing, education, and a living wage.\u201d She echoed his vision to fundamentally transform the country and called for an America that is \u201cmultigeographic\u201d and \u201cmultigendered.\u201d \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) also\u00a0offered her endorsement of Sanders, calling him the \u201conly candidate who has built a movement.\u201d Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) has not formally issued an endorsement, but Sanders is expected to join the congresswoman for a tour of her district later this month. The endorsements from key members of the far-left \u201cSquad\u201d sparked questions about their devotion to feminism and diversity. There is no shortage of women in the crowded Democrat field \u2013 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), and Marianne Williamson (D) \u2013 yet they chose the oldest male candidate in the race. Their decision sparked backlash and inspired a Vice article, which defended their decision from the critiques of \u201cwhite feminists.\u201d It is titled \u201cDon\u2019t Tell AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib Their Bernie Endorsement Isn\u2019t Feminist.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s safe to assume \u2018The Squad\u2019 doesn\u2019t need white feminists to help them understand which candidate best supports their feminist principles,\u201d it reads in part. Ocasio-Cortez said her decision to back Sanders over Warren had nothing to do with gender. Rather, she looked at the \u201cfeminist values in the campaign.\u201d \u201cFor me, this is not about \u2018Why not any other candidate?'\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, according to NPR. \u201cThe fact that [Sanders] has been fighting for these issues for so long struck me in a very personal way.\u201d \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s so important about what Senator Sanders is talking about, and what this campaign is about, is that it\u2019s far larger than a presidential campaign,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told NPR, echoing Omar\u2019s remarks. \u201cThis is about creating a mass movement.\u201d Warren did not make a big deal out of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement of her opponent, praising the freshman lawmaker for doing \u201cterrific work.\u201d \u201cI am a fan of the congresswoman. She\u2019s done some terrific work. We have worked together, and I know that once this primary is over we\u2019re all going to be on the same side,\u201d Warren\u00a0said. Ocasio-Cortez echoed that sentiment during an interview with CBS This Morning alongside Sanders. \u201cI think she\u2019s\u00a0[Warren] a fabulous candidate and so frankly, Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and myself are all on the same team in the party,\u201d she said: ",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a Business Insider report, which found that an individual needs to make \u201cat least $500,000 a year\u201d in order to make the \u201ctop one percent\u201d in the United States. \u201cA lot of people think that folks like your typical lawyer or doctor are in \u2018the 1%.\u2019 That may be bc it\u2019s hard to conceive how bad runaway inequality has gotten,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote. \u201cEven this number \u2013 $500k \u2013 reflects top income, & even THAT doesn\u2019t hold a candle to recognizing concentrated wealth,\u201d she added:  The socialist lawmaker\u2019s public complaint regarding the reality of \u201cincome inequality\u201d comes just one day after she endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\u00a0\u2013 a millionaire \u2013 for president. According to Forbes, Sanders has a $2.5 million fortune, which he acquired via \u201cestate, investments, government pensions\u2014and earnings from three books,\u201d many of which lament the very system that made his wealth possible. While his senator\u2019s salary is $174,000 per year, Forbes notes that the socialist lawmaker has made a \u201csix-figure annual salary since he joined Congress in 1991\u201d: With 28 years in office and a current salary of $174,000, Sanders is entitled to around $73,000 a year from the federal government for the rest of his life. If he were to sell that guaranteed income stream for a lump-sum pile of cash, Forbes figures he could get around $650,000 for it. In 2016, Sanders purchased a $575,000 lake house \u2013 dubbed a \u201csummer home\u201d \u2013 in the Champlain Islands, making the socialist the proud owner of not one, not two, but three homes. Despite Sanders\u2019 commitment to make the wealthy pay their \u201cfair share\u201d and eradicate the existence of billionaires, Sanders has been defensive of his own wealth accumulation. \u201cI wrote a best-selling book,\u201d he quipped during an interview with the New York Times this year. \u201cIf you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.\u201d Supporters of Sanders \u2013 many of whom are part of the wealthy elite (such as Michael Moore, who has a net worth of roughly $50 million) \u2013\u00a0believe that the government should play a key role in \u201credistributing\u201d wealth. Proponents of capitalism, however, believe that individuals in the private sector can create a better society and argue that self-interest benefits everyone, not just the \u201cone percent\u201d\u2013 a sentiment outlined by Founding Father Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations. Tax returns show that Sanders and his wife donated just 3.4 percent of their $566,000 income \u2013\u00a0or $19,000 \u2013 to charity in 2018. Despite that, Sanders has consistently slammed the wealthy for not paying their \u201cfair share.\u201d The presidential hopeful unveiled a massive plan to redistribute wealth in the U.S. via an \u201cextreme wealth tax\u201d last month, which would impose a one percent tax on couples with a net worth over $32 million. According to the plan: The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion.  Sanders reiterated in April that the wealthy \u2013\u00a0including himself \u2013\u00a0needs to pay their fair share but argued that he already pays the taxes that he owes. \u201c[Y]our taxes do show that you\u2019re a millionaire. You did make a million in 2016 and 2017. You\u2019re right, the 561 [thousand] in 2018, but your marginal tax rate was 26% because of President Trump\u2019s tax cuts,\u201d Bret Baier said during a Fox News town hall with Sanders in April. \u201cSo, why not say, I\u2019m leading this revolution, I\u2019m not going to take those?\u201d he asked. \u201cCome on. We\u2019re nearing \u2014 I am \u2014 I pay the taxes that I owe, and by the way, why don\u2019t you get Donald Trump up here and ask him how much he pays in taxes?\u201d Sanders responded, failing to explain why he did not decline the tax cut and give more the IRS voluntarily.",

However, some residents of Queens, particularly residents of the Queensbridge Houses public housing development, say that the Sanders campaign snubbed them. Queensbridge Tenants Association President April Simpson said the Sanders campaign did not seem to make significant efforts to reach out to Queensbridge residents. She said there were no flyers in the building advertising the event, although the Sanders campaign claims it did, in fact, hand some out. Simpson said the Sanders campaign did not contact her until the day before the rally, which happened to coincide with the monthly tenant association meeting. \u201cThese people were coming from near, far \u2014 but they weren\u2019t from Queensbridge,\u201d Simpson told Patch. \u201cThat rally wasn\u2019t for us.\u201d As Patch reported: A Sanders campaign spokesperson said the team handed out flyers to Queensbridge residents going in and out of their buildings on Friday, the day before the rally, and had reached out to Simpson as soon as they got her contact information and invited her to meet with Sanders. But Simpson said she felt slighted. \u201cThe residents that were sitting in the meeting, they said they found out from all the people going past,\u201d Simpson added, calling the lack of outreach \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d Community leader Bishop Mitchell Taylor was also perturbed by the Sanders campaign\u2019s purported lack of outreach and remarked that the event \u201cseemed to be a pretty white rally.\u201d \u201cThey chose a picture over a population,\u201d he said, according to Patch. \u201cHow could you use Queensbridge Park as your rallying point but not engage Queensbridge people as a part of the rally?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got the biggest projects in the world, and you didn\u2019t even let the people there know what\u2019s going on in their own neighborhood,\u201d Queensbridge resident Billy Robinson told the outlet. Simpson told Patch reporter Maya Kaufman that the Sanders campaign reached out to set up a meeting \u201cwith Sanders and Queensbridge community leaders\u201d following the publication of the Patch article. The Sanders campaign maintained that it offered such a meeting the day prior to the rally, but Simpson denies that:  Both Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders have emphasized the need to provide affordable housing for all. Sanders released a $1.5 trillion Housing for All plan which asserts that every American is entitled to a \u201cdecent\u201d home. \u201cIn the richest country in the history of the world, every American must have a safe, decent, accessible, and affordable home as a fundamental right,\u201d Sanders\u2019 proposal\u00a0states. \u201cWe need a homes guarantee.\u201d Similarly, Ocasio-Cortez has put forth a massive \u201canti-poverty\u201d proposal which gives illegal aliens access to public benefits and outlines a protections for renters under \u201cThe Place to Prosper Act.\u201d The act \u201cgives access to a \u2018counsel fund\u2019 for renters who are facing eviction and \u201cimposes a national cap of 3% on annual rent increases and begins to pursue penalties\u201d on what the freshman lawmaker calls \u2018abusive and predatory landlords,'\u201d as Breitbart News reported.",

Why do you want to do that?\u201d she asked:  The socialist lawmaker\u2019s tweet follows a snarky response to the House Republicans who stormed Schiff\u2019s secret impeachment lair on Wednesday in an effort to demand transparency.

Conducting the interviews in the basement bunker has largely allowed Democrats to leak what they believe to be key lines from witness interviews in an effort to drive the impeachment narrative. As House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) told Breitbart News Daily: The president could have legal counsel in the room to question the witnesses that were trying to take the president down. That was the Nixon standard. When they had the Clinton impeachment, reverse the parties, Republican president and House Democrat Majority, they used the Nixon standard, which was both sides can call witnesses. The White House can have a lawyer in the room to question witnesses. That didn\u2019t happen, no vote in the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) just decreed an impeachment inquiry and gave the power to Adam Schiff. It was always the [House] Judiciary Committee that ran things, but now Adam Schiff is running things behind closed doors. That was never done before. There were TV cameras in the room for Nixon, by the way. For young viewers, you can watch the Nixon videos. People watch them. You also watched the Clinton proceedings. [Schiff\u2019s] not allowing anybody to watch. 75 percent of the voting Congress is not allowed in that room to see what\u2019s going on. Ocasio-Cortez mocked the Republicans\u2019 calls for transparency. \u201cImportant to remember that GOP&Dem members have been part of impeachment depositions this whole time.

      "author": "James Delingpole",
      "content": " It won\u2019t be the only fine achievement of his inevitable two-term presidency but it may yet prove the most significant of them all. To understand why, just look at how much the world has changed since he first made his promise to quit Paris in the White House Rose Garden in 2017. Back then, nobody had ever heard of Greta Thunberg; Extinction Rebellion was but an evil, deranged glint in the mad staring eyes of its founder Roger \u2018Climate Charles Manson\u2019 Hallam; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had yet to release the cute dancing video which would transform her into a global political influencer; the Green New Deal had yet to become the defining issue for the Democrats and their base; China still looked like a large, but mostly benign entity whose plans for total world domination existed only the imaginations of paranoid conspiracy theorists; the green scare narrative and its doomsday fake news stories seemed all but played out as more and more evidence emerged that anthropogenic warming theory just didn\u2019t stand up and that the measures being introduced to \u2018combat\u2019 it were actually doing more harm than good\u2026 What a difference two years can make! While the case for man made global warming being a problem continues to get thinner and thinner, the powerful green propaganda machine has got correspondingly shriller, noisier and more aggressive. Almost every major Western economy has been bludgeoned and bullied and worn down into accepting the propaganda of the Climate Industrial Complex: that only through \u2018decarbonisation\u2019 \u2013 ie crippling the economy and consumers with green tariffs, regulations and expensive, unreliable, renewable energy \u2013 can the planet be saved from disaster. Only one Western nation has taken a stand against this dangerous nonsense and that is President Trump\u2019s USA. The person who perhaps best understood the geopolitical significance of Trump\u2019s exit from the Paris accord was my late friend Christopher Booker. One of Booker\u2019s last projects was a paper he wrote for the Global Warming Policy Foundation. It was titled \u2018Global Warming \u2013 A Case Study in Groupthink\u2019. It began: By any measure, the belief that the earth faces an unprecedented threat from \u2018human induced climate change\u2019 has been one of the most extraordinary episodes in the history of either science or politics. It has led scientists and politicians to contemplate nothing less than a complete revolution in the way mankind sources the energy required to keep modern industrial civilisation functioning, by phasing out the fossil fuels on which that civilisation has been built. That \u2018complete revolution\u2019 is well under way and already causing tremendous damage to living standards, to personal freedoms \u2013 and is undoubtedly hastening the decline of Western Industrial Civilization. (Much, no doubt, to the secret delight of geopolitical rivals such as China). If it weren\u2019t for the cussed, don\u2019t-give-a-damn insolence of one man, that situation would be a whole lot worse. Booker gives this hero due credit in the chapter titled: \u2018President Trump finally calls the groupthink\u2019s bluff\u2019. Here is what Booker had to say about the significance of Trump\u2019s Rose Garden promise to quit the Paris Climate Accord: [Trump] was also the first politician to expose what had been the real dirty secret of Paris, buried away in those INDCs, setting out how, by 2030, each country intended to respond to the proposed \u2018climate goals\u2019. Herein lay the central fraud of the entire agreement. The \u2018developing\u2019 countries, led by China and India, certainly had their eye on that proposed Green Climate Fund, whereby the developed countries would supposedly pay them $100 billion every year to assist them to \u2018decarbonise\u2019, above all by going for \u2018renewables\u2019. The developing countries had all thus paid lipservice up-front to what was required, and how they planned to expand their \u2018renewable\u2019 energy sources: wind, solar and the rest. But hidden in the small print, as Trump highlighted, was the real story. China and India, as the first and third largest carbon dioxide emitting countries in the world, were each planning to build hundreds of new coal-fired power stations, which alone would by 2030 double and treble their emissions. Analysis of the INDCs showed that almost every one of the larger developing nations planned something not dissimilar. As for that Green Climate Fund, as Trump went on to explain, it was also just make-believe. By now, only $1 billion had been pledged, of which almost all, thanks to Obama, had been offered by the US. Trump\u2019s speech may have been justifiably America-centric, in talking of how the US had been committed by Obama to paying by far the highest economic price in terms of money and lost jobs, for a deal whereby China, India and the rest would take America\u2019s money but carry on emitting carbon dioxide just as before. This was why the President was entirely justified in pulling the US out of a non-binding deal as fraudulent as any major international agreement can ever have been. But just as significant was that none of those now accusing him of \u2018betraying the future of the planet\u2019 appeared to be even remotely aware of any of the facts he had been addressing. So lost were they in their bubble that their only response was either just to resort to hysterical abuse or, by some, to claim that Trump\u2019s decision would make little difference to the battle to save the planet. This was because the EU and everyone else would be united in complying with the \u2018Accord\u2019, while China would now \u2018take the lead\u2019 in renewables and the great \u2018low carbon\u2019 revolution. All this was as perfect an example of the power of groupthink as could be imagined. President Trump, like no politician before him, had finally called the bluff of the make-believe. But so firmly cocooned from reality were the politicians and the media that none of them had even begun to realise it. Trump is the Boy who pointed out that the Climate Emperor is wearing no clothes. It\u2019s not, his instincts told him, about saving the planet. It\u2019s a power grab \u2013 a two-pronged assault on America\u2019s global hegemony as an independent, fossil-fuel energy superpower On one side, the attack comes from developing powers like China and India who \u2013 under the UN\u2019s generous terms \u2013 are free to carry on growing their economies without having to worry about their carbon emissions; on the other, it comes from Europe which wants to hamstring the U.S. economy with expensive, unreliable renewable energy in much the same way Germany has hamstrung its economy with solar and wind power. Thanks to Trump, the plan has failed. Or, at the very least, the plan has been postponed until such time as a Democrat president comes along and ruins all his good work. ",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore. The Fahrenheit 9/11 director addressed Sanders\u2019 age during his speech\u2013something Sanders has made a point to mention in his own appearances as well. During a stop in Iowa on Thursday, Sanders said, \u201cI\u2019ve been criticized for being old. I plead guilty. I am old.\u201d \u201cBut there are advantages to being old,\u201d he added. According to the Washington Post, Sanders went a bit deeper at a news conference, explaining that he views his long track record as a clear cut advantage. It demonstrates his consistency in ideology throughout the years, he states. \u201cThe ideas that I am fighting for now didn\u2019t come to me yesterday,\u201d he said, according to the Post. \u201cI\u2019ve been on more picket lines, I expect, than all my opponents combined over the last 30 years,\u201d he continued. \u201cHaving a long record gives people the understanding that these ideas that I am talking about \u2014 they are in my guts. They are in my heart,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is who I am as a human being, and it ain\u2019t gonna change.\u201d Moore, who spoke at Sanders\u2019 Queens rally last weekend, also talked about Sanders\u2019 age during the big endorsement rally. He, like Sanders, presented it as an advantage, stating that it is the Electoral College\u2013not Sanders\u2013that is too old. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s 78, and we will benefit for his wisdom and his experience and his knowledge and his love for the American people,\u201d the\u00a0Fahrenheit 9/11 director told the crowd, calling Sanders\u2019 advanced age a \u201cgift.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s actually a gift that we have a 78-year-old American running for President of the United States,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWell, here\u2019s what\u2019s too old. The Electoral College is too old. That\u2019s what\u2019s too old,\u201d he continued. \u201cA $7.25 minimum wage\u2013 that\u2019s too old. Women not being paid the same as men\u2013 that\u2019s too old.\u201d \u201cThousands and thousands of dollars in student debt. What is that?\u201d he asked. The crowd replied, \u201cToo old!\u201d He prompted the crowd in the same fashion a few more times, using healthcare deductibles, super delegates, and fossil fuel as examples as things that are \u201ctoo old.\u201d Moore also dismissed the growing concerns over Sanders\u2019 health. \u201cHow about we talk about the health of this planet that\u2019s dying. That\u2019s the health I care about,\u201d Moore declared.",

It\u2019s a terrible thing that\u2019s going on in our country \u2014 no crimes \u2014 it\u2019s an investigation in search of a crime.\u201d Omar, a far-left lawmaker who supports the impeachment inquiry, proclaimed that Trump is finally \u201cbeing held accountable.\u201d \u201cThe criminal justice system is designed to unjustly incarcerate black and brown people \u2014 and give people like you a pass. For once in your life, you\u2019re being held accountable,\u201d she wrote:  However, Democrats have failed to pinpoint a legitimate impeachable offense and have not taken the inquiry to a full House vote. Omar\u2019s remark comes days after fellow \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) warned that impeachment due process would essentially \u201chelp potential criminals line up their testimony.\u201d \u201cHey @AOC I thought you supported Open and Transparent government,\u201d Rep. Alex Mooney (R-WV) wrote in response to Ocasio-Cortez dismissing the GOP lawmakers\u2019 attempts to demand transparency by confronting House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) in his secret impeachment chamber. She called the attempt a \u201clittle flash mob.\u201d \u201cTruth is for @AOC the ends justify the means and she gladly reverts to Soviet style secret hearings in the Capitol basement,\u201d he added. The socialist lawmaker defended Schiff\u2019s secret impeachment lair and essentially argued that impeachment due process would destroy the Democrats\u2019 ability to control the narrative of the impeachment inquiry. \u201cRep. Mooney, you & I both know that when a massive crime is committed, the 1st step is to separate witnesses & get their stories to see what adds up,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou know that making these depositions public will help potential criminals line up their testimony. Why do you want to do that?\u201d she added:  Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) canceled her scheduled appearance at the historically black college after it featured and honored the president for his advances in criminal justice reform. Trump slammed the presidential hopeful, calling her a \u201cbadly failing presidential candidate\u201d and adding that his administration is doing more than Harris \u201cwill EVER be able to do for African Americans!\u201d: ",

He jumped on board and said \u2018What can I do to uplift you all? What can I do to support you all?'\u201d she continued. Tlaib claimed that \u201cthis institution\u201d has not been ready for women such as herself and heaped praise on Sanders for continually supporting their progressive efforts. \u201cThe fact that he truly believes that women like us, women that this institution hasn\u2019t been ready for, that we feel supported.

Sanders heaped praise on Tlaib for \u201cstanding up against the vulgarity and ugliness of Donald Trump\u201d and taking on the \u201cgreed and corruption of the economic establishment.\u201d Sanders said: What Rashida has been doing in less than one year is become a national figure, not just in standing up against the vulgarity and ugliness of Donald Trump, but she has taken on in a very forceful way, the greed and corruption of the economic establishment and stood up to the political establishment as well. \u201cThank you (Shukran!)

      "content": " A brush fire broke out early Monday morning \u201cclose to the southbound side of the 405 Freeway at Getty Center Drive near the Getty Center museum,\u201d prompting hundreds of thousands of evacuations. As Breitbart News reported: The Los Angeles Times reports evacuation orders have been issued from the top of Mandeville Canyon Road down to Sunset Boulevard, from Mandeville Canyon east to the 405 Freeway. An evacuation warning zone was also set for west of Interstate 405, south of Mulholland Drive, north of Sunset Boulevard, and east of Topanga Canyon. \u201cPeople in the area \u2026 are advised to prepare to evacuate due to a rapidly moving brush fire,\u201d the fire department said in a statement posted on Nixle. Elsewhere, as nearly 200,000 people remain under evacuation order from threat of wildfires, some of the millions of people in Northern California on track to get their electricity back may not have power restored before another possible round of shut-offs and debilitating winds. Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz did not mince words, warning residents in mandatory evacuation zones to \u201cget the hell out.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re in the mandatory evacuation zone and you\u2019re still there watching this, you\u2019re an idiot, get the hell out,\u201d he stated. Ocasio-Cortez responded to the news of the devastating fire, using the tragedy to push her Green New Deal. \u201cThis is what climate change looks like,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe GOP like to mock scientific warnings about climate change as exaggeration. But just look around: it\u2019s already starting.\u201d \u201cWe have 10 years to cut carbon emissions in half. If we don\u2019t, scenes like this can get much worse,\u201d she warned, using the hashtag \u201c#GreenNewDeal\u201d:  Critics of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s climate change agenda say it is disingenuous to blame wildfires solely on \u201cclimate change.\u201d For example, the Kincade Fire, which prompted roughly 200,000 evacuations and burned at least 54,000 acres in Northern wine country, was possibly\u00a0caused by Pacific Gas & Electric\u2019s broken transmission line, according to the Los Angeles Times. However, investigators have yet to pinpoint the exact cause. Townhall references\u00a0an argument made by Chuck Devore, the Vice President of National Initiatives at the Texas Public Policy Foundation and a former California lawmaker, who argues that it is \u201cdecades of environmental mismanagement that has created a tinderbox of unharvested timber, dead trees, and thick underbrush\u201d that has caused these massive wildfires\u2013\u00a0not climate change. He wrote in Forbes: This is California\u2019s big secret: it\u2019s not climate change that\u2019s burning up the forests, killing people, and destroying hundreds of homes; it\u2019s decades of environmental mismanagement that has created a tinderbox of unharvested timber, dead trees, and thick underbrush. This dangerous situation attracted attention from President Donald Trump who, during the height of California\u2019s wildfires last year insisted that \u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor.\u201d The irony is that forest management is so bad on public lands that a new report, ordered by the California legislature in 2010, shows that the portion of California\u2019s National Forests protected from timber harvesting is now a net contributor to atmospheric carbon dioxide due to fires and trees killed by insects and disease. \u2026 If federal and state environmental policies continue to make it difficult and costly to harvest timber and manage the fuel load, then the wildfires will continue and they will be bigger and deadlier. This will, in due course, cause some politicians to blame the fires on climate change. Many users responded to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tweet, criticizing the freshman lawmaker for ignoring the complexity of the issue in order to aggressively push her progressive agenda. \u201cAOC PG&E has an aging infrastructure and needs to be updated and underground cable. Get your facts right,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cThis is what it looks like when state law prohibits clearing of dead brush and debris from forests,\u201d another tweeted. \u201cThis is what poor forest management and antiquated, faulty and dangerous power lines failing looks like!\u201d another added.

Ocasio-Cortez was incensed and accused GOP lawmakers of disrespecting the process. \u201cAnd I just want to know what the reason for such disrespect of our process would potentially be. Do we have a reason for why this hearing is trying to be adjourned? Or, you know, do we have just like a cocktail party?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked. Armstrong snapped back: I have one. I have a real easy one. The oil industry is the second largest industry in my state. My constituents expect me to be here. We are running an impeachment hearing down in the basement of the Capitol right now. \u201cWait so is this about the oil industry or impeachment, \u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked. \u201cIt\u2019s about the economy of the state of North Dakota \u2026 I want to participate in this hearing, but I also feel the need to be in the SCIF because we are only one of three committees that\u2019s allowed to be in the room,\u201d Armstrong replied. He went on: I feel the need to be in the SCIF because we\u2019re only one of three committees that\u2019s allowed to be in the room. I can do a lot of things. I can\u2019t be two places at once. I\u2019m completely comfortable having this hearing; I just prefer to have it at a time when I could participate in it in. Ocasio-Cortez questioned Armstrong for airing his grievances during the hearing, prompting Jordan to jump into the conversation. \u201cWe\u2019ve expressed this last week about have two things going on at the same time,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t talked about this, but you guys continue to do hearings at the same time there are depositions going on.\u201d \u201cAs the gentleman from North Dakota said, we can\u2019t be two places at once. You talked about the one\u2013 do your job? There\u2019s no way to do that when you have to be two places at once,\u201d he added.",

Biden said during a\u00a0January 2018 appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations: So they said they had\u2014they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I\u2019m not going to\u2014or, we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You\u2019re not the president. The president said\u2014I said, call him. \u201cI said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours,\u201d he continued. \u201cI looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired,\u201d he added: ",

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " The book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us, hits bookstores stores Tuesday, and Trump, Jr., joined Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend ahead of its public release to discuss the book and the Democrat Party\u2019s radical turn. Trump, Jr., even launched a website TriggerALib.com where people can send copies of the book to top leftists like 2016 failed Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and even Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT). \u201cI have plenty of friends who are Democrats and I have plenty of friends who are from what would have been blue collar years ago Democrat rust belt America, and I just go to them because there\u2019s a strong history component to some of this,\u201d Trump, Jr., told Breitbart News. \u201cWe talk about this in Triggered as well. Their grandfather voted Democrat, their father voted Democrat, they\u2019re union families\u2014I just go listen, \u2018look at the platforms. Look at Donald Trump\u2019s platform versus today\u2019s modern Democrat platform.\u2019 The inmates are running the asylum over at the DNC. They\u2019re not standing for the American worker anymore. Their values are not your grandfather\u2019s Democrat Party values. JFK would be \u2018alt-right\u2019 today, he\u2019d be the worst human being in the world. When you start saying that to those guys that again have this\u2014it\u2019s more of a tradition than anything\u2014it\u2019s like whoa. That\u2019s when the lightbulb goes off: \u2018you\u2019re right.\u2019 This is not the Democrat Party that I knew. This is not the Democrat Party that I knew 10 to 15 years ago in college. I mean, it\u2019s gone nuts. It\u2019s being run by the craziest crazies, by the lunatic fringe of the party. There isn\u2019t a moderate Democrat anymore. Just look at the presidential contenders. I mean, they\u2019re putting forward socialist platforms and ideals. It\u2019s never-ending.\u201d Trump, Jr., said the \u201cage of outrage\u201d system in which the establishment media and left freak out about everything on Trump \u201conly flows one way\u201d: against Trump and his supporters. \u201cYou see that in the media response, you see that in the Democrat political response, it\u2019s just\u2014I think Triggered really captures the environment that we\u2019re in,\u201d Trump, Jr., outlined. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to see this around the country both from the campaign and when I speak on college campuses because we are willing to have that dialogue with everyone else. But it seems like the dialogue only goes one way. When we go somewhere, the people who show up to listen only show up to listen\u2014but the people who may have different views go there to sort of only disrupt and prevent you from delivering that message. I hear about all this tolerance supposedly from the left and they\u2019re preaching it day in and day out that they\u2019re very tolerant unless you don\u2019t agree with them fully. Then they are quite the opposite of tolerant. I can assure you there is nothing quite so intolerant as a leftist preaching tolerance every day.\u201d Trump, Jr., said there are examples of the media and leftist triggers \u201cevery day,\u201d and cited several recent examples like when the Washington Post fawned over ISIS terrorist leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi after a raid ordered by President Trump led to the world\u2019s most-wanted terrorist\u2019s death and when the media maligned Trump\u2019s entrance to the recent UFC fight at Madison Square Garden. \u201cYou see how triggered the mainstream media has become,\u201d Trump, Jr., said. \u201cThere\u2019s no secret that they were always left-leaning, but now they don\u2019t even pretend to be objective anymore. Last weekend when my father got the number one terrorist in the world\u2014the founder of ISIS\u2014you\u2019d think that they would rejoice. Instead, the Washington Post does an obituary almost mourning the loss of Al-Baghdadi calling him an \u2018Austere Religious Scholar\u2019 not a piece of garbage, rapist, murdering terrorist that by the way lit journalists on fire. That hate, their outrage really only goes one way. They\u2019ll do anything to try and sell that point to the point where they don\u2019t even tell the truth anymore. Heck, I was with my father last night at Madison Square Garden at the UFC fight and we walked out and Dana White said directly to me \u2018wow, that was the most incredible entrance I have ever seen.\u2019 By all accounts, it was awesome. Within seconds, I turn to my brother and go that was awesome\u2014watch what the mainstream media does. Within seconds, blue checkmark Twitter is going \u2018Trump is booed.\u2019 Such nonsense you can\u2019t even imagine it. I was sort of putting the videos up today on my Instagram feed to sort of prove the point. And that\u2019s in the heart of New York City.\u201d The media and left, Trump, Jr., said, will \u201cdo and say anything\u201d and \u201chave no morals anymore\u201d and \u201chave no compass guiding them.\u201d That, he said, is because they despise Trump so much they don\u2019t even care what the policy consequences of their lies and attacks are\u2014as long as they adhere to a preconceived narrative designed to protect failed leftist visions and attack the conservative vision of his father. \u201cIt\u2019s only outrage and hate because they don\u2019t like that you have someone actually fighting for the things that are good for the American people for a change, actually getting it done, you don\u2019t have a failed presidency with nothing but failures like you did under Barack Obama,\u201d Trump, Jr., said. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting that they don\u2019t want these things to continue\u2014record high numbers with regard to the economy, record low numbers as it relates to unemployment. All they want to do is talk about resistance and impeachment when even the people involved say there was no impeachable offense here, \u2018what are guys even talking about?\u2019 The hatred that\u2019s manifested itself from the left has just been nuts, and for me\u2014I was one of the biggest targets of that, right? Over the last three years, I was the number two target of the Mueller Hoax which was a freaking joke. We all saw in about two seconds after he got on the stand and started testifying he didn\u2019t even know where the hell he was let alone what was in his report\u2014minor details\u2014but that\u2019s why I decided it was time to write a book. I was like, \u2018you know what? We got to showcase this thing in long form.\u2019 I can only say so much in a 5-minute or 10-minute radio or TV interview, and we did just that\u2014and I think it will drive them nuts.\u201d Asked what the biggest trigger he sees from the left is, Trump, Jr., said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot,\u201d and the book gets \u201cinto all of them.\u201d He specifically cited how the tech giants have been trying to silence conservatives including himself and the radical agenda of the transgender community. \u201cWe get into internet censorship. That\u2019s obviously a huge one because if these guys can do it to me\u2014if they can shut down my Instagram account, if they can shadow ban me, if I can\u2019t show up in my search engine searching my own handle which happens to be similar to my father who is the president of the United States with 50 million followers, who aren\u2019t they silencing?\u201d Trump, Jr., said. \u201cI talk a little bit about some of the stuff going on with the trans movement, and I\u2019m like the most live and let live person you can imagine. I don\u2019t care how you identify. Guess what? If you\u2019re happy and productive, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t have to hear about it all day long, but I don\u2019t give a damn. I do start having a problem when you have men who transition to women but have all the strength, body structure, and size of a man and are competing against women who have spent their whole lives to master a sport. I do think that\u2019s a little ridiculous, and I\u2019ve called it out and even some of them have turned on their own. Even some of the LGBT leaders, who have been doing this for 30 years, have said they don\u2019t think this is right. Watch them destroy someone who\u2019s been an advocate for them for 40 years because they\u2019re apparently no longer woke enough\u2014not just blindly buying into this crap. I start saying: Where are the feminists? Where are the people who fought for all of these rights for women for all of these years? Again, I don\u2019t care what you do in your own life\u2014it\u2019s when you start really affecting other people and their lives pushing this nonsense that I start really having a problem with it. So again it\u2019s delineating all of this, and I actually probably don\u2019t take it as far as a lot of people because I\u2019m trying to actually have a reasonable dialogue with people where you can see some of this lunacy and highlight it properly.\u201d Trump, Jr., praised comedian Dave Chappelle for his recent Netflix special in which Chappelle \u201chad the guts, unlike most\u201d to stand up to this radical transgender community and against the preconceived narratives of the establishment and media. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a comedian anymore. You can\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d Trump, Jr., said. \u201c[Chappelle] is one of the best of all time. Some of the skits of his that I used to watch back in my college days, not all that long ago but long enough\u2014you could never do that stuff today. They\u2019d be like \u2018you\u2019re racist, misogynist, homophobe,\u2019 whatever it is.\u201d Trump, Jr., said the \u201cwoke culture\u201d of the left is now \u201cso insane\u201d that \u201cthe goalposts are always moving.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s never enough. The second you get what you want, then it\u2019s like \u2018let\u2019s move the goalposts even further to the extreme,\u2019\u201d Trump, Jr., said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it resonates with regular people who are again, when I talk about the trans women in female sports I always close up with: \u2018Why is it only the men turning into women that win? How come it only goes that way? How come you don\u2019t see it the other way?\u2019 I\u2019ll say this stuff on Twitter, and if I point it out or even say \u2018Good Morning\u2019 on Twitter the left will try to cancel me for it. That\u2019s one of those, surprisingly enough, that even the leftists come out and say \u2018you know what? I don\u2019t like anything Don Jr. says, I can\u2019t believe it. I can\u2019t believe that I have to agree with him on this one.\u2019 We\u2019ve gone too far. It\u2019s become asinine. So, I devote a lot of time in the book to how this is just the never-ending movement of the goalposts to achieve some sort of woke end that\u2019s always moving. It\u2019s like infinity. It keeps getting crazier and crazier. And so, I\u2019m a pretty reasonable guy on a lot of these things but eventually you lose me\u2014and you probably lose a lot of other people. I\u2019m shocked that there\u2019s not more people who have the guts to actually stand up to this craziness when I see all the people who are like \u2018yeah, I agree with him on this one.\u2019 Agreeing and then actually doing something are a little bit different\u2014that\u2019s also sort of why I had to write the book. You can see this stuff, you can disagree with it, but then eventually you have to start acting on it. I\u2019m hoping this is actually something that is seen by people on both sides as a reasonable take on some of the insanity that is today\u2019s sort of modern left.\u201d Trump, Jr., also lit into Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son. In the book, which Trump, Jr., wrote long before this current Ukraine scandal-turned-impeachment-against-Trump started, the president\u2019s son rips into Hunter Biden as well. In this interview, he explained key differences between the Bidens and the Trumps when it comes to their public life. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking about this for a year. I literally wrote and finished the book before any of that stuff even manifested itself,\u201d Trump, Jr., said of Hunter Biden. \u201cThey said, \u2018Donald Trump, Jr., you\u2019re also the son of a rich guy,\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u2018yeah, I am you\u2019re right. And a big part of me is because my dad is who he is, I totally get that.\u2019 I acknowledge that. The difference is we didn\u2019t make our fortune pretending we\u2019re public servants. We did it as business people, we were international business people for decades before we ever got into office and we stopped doing new deals abroad because of it. Hunter Biden did nothing other than get thrown out of the Navy for doing cocaine before his dad became Vice President and all of a sudden he\u2019s magically an international businessman sitting on the board of a company in a language he doesn\u2019t speak in a business he knows nothing about getting 83 grand a month. He\u2019s going over to China where the greatest investors in the world take 10 to 15 years to break in if they can ever get in and five days later he comes back with $1.5 billion after flying over there on Air Force Two with his father. There\u2019s a huge distinction. I recognize we\u2019re both where we are because of our fathers. I just didn\u2019t do it because my dad was pretending to be a public servant and utilizing all of the powers associated with therewith. He\u2019s basically taking a taxpayer-funded subsidy and getting rich because his dad\u2019s writing bills and creating laws and his dad\u2019s helping to run the U.S. I mean, I could never get away with that but for him the media is like \u2018oh no kids are off limits.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing, Hunter Biden\u2014who is 50\u2014with drug problems and a total mess and all the corruption and all of this, he\u2019s totally off limits but my younger brother Barron who\u2019s 15, he\u2019s fair game? They can attack him all day long? They can attack Tiffany, who\u2019s in law school at 25 and try to destroy her? I\u2019ve gotten to live through some of this. I\u2019ve been one of the targets. My kids have been targeted. They\u2019ve opened up exploding envelopes at our house. So yeah I\u2019ve got something to write about and it\u2019s really all covered in the book.\u201d Trump, Jr., dedicates his book Triggered to \u201cThe Deplorables,\u201d the people failed 2016 Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton maligned as \u201cdeplorable\u201d and irredeemable\u201d in the 2016 election. Her insults of the voters galvanized huge swaths of the country against her, and in favor of President Trump. Trump, Jr., said in his interview with Breitbart News Sunday that he dedicated the book to \u201cThe Deplorables\u201d because they \u201cdeserve it\u201d after everything they have been through not just in the 2016 election but since then as well after sticking with the prudent \u201cthrough thick and thin.\u201d \u201cThrough all of the hate, through all of the nonsense, through the Mueller hoax, through $40 million of U.S. taxpayer dollars with 19 Hillary Clinton donors trying to throw us all in jail, not one of those people ever doubted us,\u201d Trump, Jr., said. \u201cYou probably heard me say in my stump speech or if I\u2019m opening up for my father, I\u2019m like \u2018that wasn\u2019t a win for us.\u2019 That wasn\u2019t a win for my father. It was nice, but more importantly it was a win for those people who never even doubted us for a second. I know they\u2019re going to come out hard, they\u2019re going to bring their friends, they\u2019re going to fight for us, today is the one more year until four more years anniversary. We are exactly one year out from election day right now. I know those guys are going to be out there fighting, and they\u2019re going to make sure we get this thing across the line\u2014and we\u2019re going to do it for another four years after this year and we\u2019re going to be able to get this country going in the right direction. My father has already started changing that course aggressively with good policies, with action, despite an unprecedented amount of incoming. We\u2019re going to keep that going. But we\u2019re going to need those guys out there. So if there\u2019s anyone who deserves a dedication through all this, through all the name-calling, through all the things they\u2019ve been called, through all the hatred that those hardworking men and women who wanna make sure they can live the American dream for themselves and for their kids, man if there\u2019s someone who deserves a dedication it\u2019s them and I wanted to make sure that was recognized.\u201d LISTEN TO DONALD TRUMP, JR., ON BREITBART NEWS SUNDAY: ",

      "author": "Brian Lonergan",
      "content": " In one story, D\u2019Souza asked a friend in Mumbai why he was trying so hard to relocate to America. His friend\u2019s response? \u201cI really want to move to a country where the poor people are fat.\u201d Citizens of the world can be forgiven for seeing America as a land of luxury. Apparently that extends to illegal aliens, as one recently filed a lawsuit in part because the accommodations at government detention facilities are not on par with those at the Ritz-Carlton. In a case underway in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, an illegal alien named Martha Gonzalez is suing a federal government contractor that administers several immigration detention facilities, including the one in Texas she calls home. Gonzalez claims that, by requiring detainees to clean up their own living quarters and allowing them to do low-paying work in the facility, the contractor is running illegal slave camps in violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Before the establishment media clutches their pearls in horror, some context is sorely needed here. In its brief in the case, attorneys for the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) explained how the plaintiff\u2019s argument is beyond absurd. Alien detainees are free to leave these facilities whenever they want. In many cases, federal law allows criminal aliens to return to their home countries instead of waiting in detention while their immigration claims proceed. Why would they stay? Maybe because they know that, with an overwhelmed immigration system and a vocal anti-borders movement advocating for them, they are willing to \u201cwait it out\u201d in the hope of winning legal status. So the idea that they are being held against their will is a farce. Gonzalez is trying to make her case a class action on behalf of a large group of aliens also subject to the requirement that they clean their own spaces. The class also would include aliens who volunteer to work elsewhere in their detention facilities for $1 per day. The alternative to having detainees clean up their personal space is for taxpayer-funded personal cleaning services to do it, essentially maid service. This is a luxury not enjoyed by anyone else in detention in the U.S. Proverbial bomb-throwing activists like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have likened immigration detention facilities to concentration camps. Apparently anything less than turndown service and a mint on the pillow now constitutes a crime against humanity. The plaintiff also claims that paying the detainees $1 per day for work is outrageous and constitutes slave labor. As anyone who has been in the correctional system or even seen it in documentaries can attest, inmates are paid extremely low wages for menial work done in the facility. Is that \u201cfair?\u201d From a living wage perspective, maybe not (but then again, inmates do get free room and board). In any case, low pay is part and parcel of the detainment experience for people who have committed acts like homicide, tax evasion, or illegally entering a country. One dollar is actually in line with detainee compensation throughout the country. Inmates at state correctional facilities in Indiana, for comparison\u2019s sake, are paid 25 cents per hour. Equally important is that the purportedly cruel buck-a-day pay rate was expressly determined not by the contractor, but by the duly elected members of the U.S. Congress. That\u2019s right, the same politicians who make a grand spectacle in televised hearings screaming at members of immigration enforcement for carrying out laws that they themselves voted for. The contractor is simply complying with the terms of the contract it signed with Congress. If our ruling class on Capitol Hill has a problem with that, perhaps they should schedule a vote to increase the pay rate for illegal aliens in detention and fund cleaning services for their personal spaces. Don\u2019t expect such a vote any time soon, as it could be a liability for anyone seeking re-election next year. Most Americans can\u2019t afford to stay in a five-star hotel. They might have a problem with paying for illegal aliens to do it.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The former vice president, who was once the Democrat frontrunner but has been eclipsed by Warren in recent months, made the comments in a self-published Medium piece titled, \u201cI Have Fought for the Democratic Party My Whole Career.\u201d The piece, although not mentioning Warren by name, set out to repudiate not only her suggestion that Biden should be seeking the Republican nomination but also the \u201cangry unyielding viewpoint\u201d that those who \u201cdisagree with you \u2026 must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.\u201d \u201cSome call it the \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach to politics. But it\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view,\u201d the former vice president wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s representative of an elitism that working and middle class people do not share: \u2018We know best; you know nothing\u2019. \u2018If you were only as smart as I am you would agree with me.'\u201d Biden proceeded to argue such tactics were not conducive to getting \u201canything done\u201d or building a party that was capable of beating President Donald Trump in 2020. \u201cI learned a long time ago that if you question someone\u2019s motivations rather than their judgment you get nowhere,\u201d he stated. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get past go if you start off by saying the other person is in the pocket of special interests or is corrupt.\u201d Despite the pleas for \u201ccompromise\u201d and \u201cunity,\u201d Biden spent a good deal of the piece highlighting his own policy prescriptions, many of which are directly in opposition to those being proposed by more liberal Democrats like Warren. In particular, the former vice president touted his proposal for expanding ObamaCare through a public option, which Warren and others have claimed will not be as efficient as Medicare for All. \u201cI stand with the Democratic Party of Barack Obama \u2014 the party that fought for and passed the Affordable Care Act \u2014 an historic transformation of our health care system that took a generation to achieve,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cI\u2019m not walking away from ObamaCare \u2026 Maybe others want to walk away from ObamaCare \u2014 I don\u2019t.\u201d The medium piece comes as the Biden and Warren camps have traded barbs back and forth in recent weeks. Biden, specifically, has attacked Warren for lying about how she would pay for her Medicare for All proposal without raising taxes on the middle class. It was in response to such attacks last week that Warren suggested Biden was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d Even though Biden had technically started the altercation, the former vice president\u2019s campaign manager used the opening to attack\u00a0Warren\u2019s prior Republican affiliation. Many have noted that the flare-up between the two camps underscores the ideological divisions raging within the Democrat Party at the moment. Biden, who claims to be the only Democrat to win back the white working class, is campaigning as something of a moderate that will bring forth incremental change. The strategy is evident by the former vice president\u2019s policy platform, which is full of ideas that were seen as too radical during the Obama years but are now considered tepid when compared to those advocated by progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Warren, on the other hand, is a proponent of radical change, as exhibited by her endorsements of a wealth tax and the Green New Deal. Adding to the antagonism between the camps is the precarious position Biden finds himself in three months away from the first nominating contest in Iowa. Although the former vice president started the race as the clear frontrunner, leading the field by as much as\u00a032 percentage points\u00a0at one point, his campaign has steadily declined. Biden\u2019s decreasing political fortunes have comes as Warren\u2019s have\u00a0only increased. The Massachusetts Democrat has leapfrogged Biden in the early primary and caucus states. One recent poll out of Iowa showed Warren leading the field with 28 percent support among Democrats, while Biden was relegated to fourth place\u00a0with only 12 percent. A similar situation has played out nationally, by which most polls show Warren leading Biden, albeit with a narrow margin. As Biden\u2019s campaign spins downward, his attacks on Warren, who many now acknowledge as the frontrunner, have only increased, culminating in his Medium piece on Tuesday. \u201cI have fought for the Democratic party my whole career. I know what we stand for, who we stand with and what we believe. And it\u2019s not just policies or issues. It\u2019s in my bones,\u201d the former vice president stated. \u201cThat\u2019s not something everyone in this primary can say.\u201d",

It\u2019s called a coup,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe must unequivocally oppose political violence in Bolivia. Bolivians deserve free and fair elections\u201d:  Omar also offered no evidence that the military \u201cpushed out\u201d Morales. Reaction from the Republican side was very different. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), widely considered the most influential Republican voice on issues surrounding Latin America, pointed to the fact that Morales\u2019s re-election was unconstitutional as he had already served three terms in office.  His sentiment was echoed by President Donald Trump, who described it as a \u201csignificant moment for democracy in the Western Hemisphere.\u201d \u201cAfter nearly 14 years and his recent attempt to override the Bolivian constitution and the will of the people, Morales\u2019s departure preserves democracy and paves the way for the Bolivian people to have their voices heard,\u201d Trump said in a statement. He continued: The United States applauds the Bolivian people for demanding freedom and the Bolivian military for abiding by its oath to protect not just a single person, but Bolivia\u2019s constitution. These events send a strong signal to the illegitimate regimes in Venezuela and Nicaragua that democracy and the will of the people will always prevail. We are now one step closer to a completely democratic, prosperous, and free Western Hemisphere.

      "content": " On Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said today\u2019s public hearing in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump was \u201dnot just about something that has occurred.\u201d She said it was instead \u201cabout preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring next year.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cThe whole point of the public hearings is to present the facts to the public and let the general public see the facts for themselves and understand why we have chosen to move forward with the impeachment inquiry. What we heard today was astounding and devastating news for the president and anyone in the administration, really partaking. Frankly, this is devastating for the country. Our national security has been compromised, our elections potentially compromised. I think right now what Republicans have to do is decide what their role is going to be in the scope of history. We will look back at this time and really truly examine the moral decisions each member of Congress decided to make.\u201d She continued, \u201cThis call with Ambassador Sondland and President Trump is a personal call that our witnesses testified an aide was overhearing where Trump was personally invested in these investigations and add a layer of proximity. One of the ways the president could have potentially tried to get out of this situation is put several degrees of separation between him and some of this illicit\u00a0activity. What we heard today was he himself was making and partaking in some of these phone calls, not just Guiliani and not just anyone else in the administration, but him. That really adds a much more disturbing degree of the involvement that he had in using the powers of government to create politically motivated investigations.\u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019d like to remind everyone, one of the initial people who brought this conversation of quid pro quo into this conversation was the president. It was when these allegations first came out about Ukraine, he started tweeting and frankly raising the bar saying, \u2018No quid pro quo, no quid pro quo.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t Democrats that set that bar, because you don\u2019t need quid pro quo. He met it, all of that aside, we\u2019re focused on him using the power of the United States government to engage in extortion of a foreign government in order to intervene in our elections. I think that\u2019s our message, the fact he undermined national security, that he is trying to undermine an election, he is engaged in flagrant abuse of power should be a concern to all Americans who believe in rule of law in the United States of America.\u201d She concluded, \u201cWe also need to move quite quickly because we\u2019re talking about the potential compromise of the 2020 elections. And so this is not just about something that has occurred; this is about preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring next year.\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

Just a thought!  Bloomberg filed paperwork Tuesday to appear on the ballot in Arkansas\u2019 March 3 presidential primary, the latest indication that the billionaire former New York City mayor may seek the Democrat nomination. Bloomberg sent staffers to Alabama last week to file for the primary there, but filed his paperwork in person in Arkansas two hours before the state\u2019s deadline. \u201cWe\u2019re getting closer\u201d to making a decision, Bloomberg told reporters after filing paperwork at the Arkansas Capitol. He\u2019s moving toward a presidential bid as he warns that the current field of Democratic presidential candidates isn\u2019t equipped to defeat President Donald Trump next year. If he runs, Bloomberg plans to skip campaigning in the traditional early voting states and focus more on Super Tuesday states, including Arkansas and Alabama. Bloomberg has rebuffed criticism from his potential rivals that his candidacy would amount to buying the election, saying self-financing his campaign means he wouldn\u2019t be beholden to anyone. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tweet comes after\u00a0former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (D) announced that he too is mounting a late bid for president.

      "subtitle": "Former Democrat Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA), in recent days, has exposed herself as a radical feminist leftist hellbent on taking down the president and maiming those who support him.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The disgraced Democrat fell from her position of legislative authority in stunning fashion, resigning from Congress after finding herself unable to overcome mounting allegations of inappropriate sexual relationships with members of her staff. In recent days, Hill has rebranded herself as an \u201cunfiltered,\u201d woman, no longer shackled by expectations to represent a relatively split district or distracted by the political jockeying that dominates the nation\u2019s capital. As such, she has exposed herself for what she has been all along: A radical feminist leftist obsessed with taking down the president. The California Democrat, 32,\u00a0rose to the national spotlight in October after allegations of inappropriate sexual relationships with members of her congressional staff surfaced. The allegations included a \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship with a female staffer \u2013 a relationship she eventually admitted to and described as \u201cinappropriate.\u201d She was also accused of carrying on an affair with a male staffer, which she denied. Nonetheless, the allegations sparked an ethics probe. Hill formally resigned shortly thereafter, but not before voting alongside her impeachment-driven colleagues to pass the partisan impeachment inquiry resolution, which has yet to expose any instance of criminal behavior on the part of President Trump. Hill, bizarrely, said she voted in favor of the resolution\u00a0\u201con behalf of the women of the United States of America.\u201d Prior to the vote, she attributed her political demise, in part, to sexism and blasted \u201cright-wing media\u201d and \u201cRepublican opponents\u201d for\u00a0\u201cenabling and perpetuating\u201d her husband\u2019s \u201cabuse\u201d by reporting on her alleged sexual escapades. Scandal aside, Hill did not tend to make headlines during her short tenure as a congresswoman. While she was part of the infamous freshman class of House Democrats \u2013 which includes Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) \u2013 she maintained a relatively low profile, at least in comparison. That could have had something to do with the fact that she represented a relatively split district, defeating incumbent Republican\u00a0Steve Knight with 54.4 percent to Knight\u2019s 45.6 percent. The district has flipped from red to blue since its creation in both House races and presidential elections, causing its representatives, specifically, to play a different political game than counterparts in \u201csafe\u201d districts. As an example, Ocasio-Cortez, who has championed radical proposals such as the Green New Deal and formally endorsed socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT),\u00a0secured a win in New York\u2019s 14th district with a whopping 78.2 percent of the vote. Tlaib secured\u00a084.6 percent in Michigan\u2019s 13th district, and Omar garnered 78.2 percent of the vote in Minnesota\u2019s 5th district. The wide margins grant far-left Democrats more flexibility in terms of promoting radical ideas and ultra-progressive proposals \u2013 proposals that tend to make more \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrats in the House nervous due to electability. Hill did not have that luxury, until now. The\u00a0mask has slipped. She has been, essentially, celebrating her freedom from any burdensome cover like representing a politically split district, which forced her to keep her true thoughts at bay. On Tuesday evening, the former lawmaker announced in a video on Twitter that she would soon be resurfacing in a more \u201cunfiltered\u201d way, admitting that it had everything to do with the fact that she no longer serves in Congress. \u201c[I] also wanted you to know I\u2019m starting to resurface. You\u2019re going to be seeing more of me on social media. More of me out and about so I look forward to seeing all of you,\u201d she said, donning a shirt from her \u201cgood friend Ayanna [Pressley]. \u201cAnd I wanted to say that now I\u2019m not a member of Congress it might be a little bit more unfiltered, which I\u2019m kind of looking forward to,\u201d she added:  Hill originally ran on run-of-the-mill Democrat ideas, signaling support for Medicare for All and a federal ban on \u201cassault\u201d weapons and calling climate change \u201cone of the greatest threats to our planet.\u201d However, she also took what many described as a \u201cmoderate\u201d approach on immigration, expressing a willingness to compromise: Border security in exchange for DACA protections \u2013 a departure from the \u201cSquad.\u201d In a June 12 piece ahead of the 2018 election, the New Yorker described Hill as a \u201ccentrist Democrat\u201d who \u201cflouts the old identity conventions of female political contenders\u201d by identifying as bisexual. Prior to joining Congress, Hill led PATH\u00a0(People Assisting the Homeless) and \u201cspearheaded a ballot measure to raise more than a billion dollars to fund permanent supportive housing for the homeless in Los Angeles.\u201d She told the New Yorker: Passing H.H.H. was this incredible victory. But instead of being able to celebrate, we realized what it meant to have a Republican House and Senate and Donald Trump as President\u2014that that could undermine every bit of hard work we\u2019d accomplished. So she ran and won, successfully flipping the district back to blue, in part by painting herself, with the help of media, as a more \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrat. Hill has since shown that is far from the case. The new, \u201cunfiltered\u201d Hill has made good on her promise to resurface, unabashedly picking fights with her former colleagues on Twitter and others she likely would have otherwise ignored, had her alleged sexual escapades not taken her down. On Wednesday, Hill\u00a0weighed\u00a0in on the extraordinary coded message Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) dropped in a string of impeachment-related tweets on Wednesday, which read, \u201cEpstein didn\u2019t kill himself\u201d \u2013 a social media phenomenon which has been featured on a number of memes in recent weeks:  \u201cYou\u2019re surprised by me? You single handedly taught an entire country a new word. #throuple. And wth is up with that tattoo?\u201d Gosar said, referencing a\u00a0Daily Mail\u00a0article that featured \u201cshocking\u201d photos of the former congresswoman. \u201cGee Doc, I am sorry you\u2019re behind the times. @sho_shameless taught the country that word way back in season 7,\u201d Hill said. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t talk to me about a tattoo\u2026 because you just admitted you clicked to see my nudes and that disturbs the hell out of me,\u201d she added, referring to the photos featured in the Daily Mail article:  Hill was particularly active during Wednesday\u2019s lackluster impeachment hearing, desperately trying to assist her former Democrat colleagues from the sidelines. In one tweet, she declared that the identity of the so-called \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d whose second-hand complaint sparked the partisan impeachment inquiry, \u201cDOES NOT MATTER.\u201d In the tweet, she referred to the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d as a man and added a sarcastic explanation to her critics: PS I am saying \u2018he\u2019 because I listened to The Daily podcast with @mikiebarb today and they said the whistleblower is known to be a man.\u00a0 Today\u2019s episode \u2018A third graders guide to the impeachment hearings\u2019 is a must listen for learning\u2026 and also adorable. In another tweet, she claimed that Trump \u201cwas not asking for something to help America but to straight up help HIMSELF get re-elected.\u201d That Democrat talking point, however, is patently false. Trump did not condition aid on investigations into a potential political opponent. Hill also used her renewed social media presence to attack more of her colleagues, dropping an \u201cOMG\u201d and continuing to lambaste Republicans. She even retweeted a highly inflammatory remark from Samantha Bee\u2019s \u2013\u00a0a notorious anti-Trumper \u2013\u00a0Full Frontal account, which read, \u201cJim Jordan is pretending that the impeachment witnesses are Ohio State wrestlers and he\u2019s an assistant coach.\u201d She also attempted to compare President Zelensky\u2019s denial of \u201cpressure\u201d to her own experience of alleged sexual abuse. \u201c@RepJohnRatcliffe is trying to say that because Zelensky publicly said he wasn\u2019t being coerced by Trump means he wasn\u2019t. Well, I denied any kind of abuse not just publicly but to my closest friends and family for years,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is no different.\u201d More:     In another tweet, Hill lamented Breitbart News for merely reporting on her self-proclaimed emergence back into the spotlight:  In the days following her political fall, Hill has attempted to attach her recent experience to a greater feminist movement, using her newfound voice as a modern-day feminist rallying cry. Shortly after her resignation, Hill, who admitted to an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate, took to Twitter and referred to Trump as a\u00a0\u201cserial sexual predator\u201d and encouraged U.S. voters to put a woman in the office as a way to stomp the patriarchy and \u201cshow women and girls that we matter\u201d:  It is a similar sentiment Hill expressed on the House floor following her final vote on the impeachment inquiry, attempting to tie the impeachment of Trump to feminism \u2013\u00a0two subjects that have little in common. \u201cAnd so today, as my last vote, I voted on impeachment proceedings. Not just because of corruption, obstruction of justice, or gross misconduct, but because of the deepest abuse of power including the abuse of power over women,\u201d Hill said on the House floor. \u201cToday, as my final act, I voted to move forward with the impeachment of Donald Trump on behalf of the women of the United States of America,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe will not stand down. We will not be broken. We will not be silenced. We will rise, and we will then make tomorrow better than today,\u201d she added. As Hill teased, Americans can expect more from the former lawmaker, who is now \u2013\u00a0for all intents and purposes \u2013 politically exposed, unrestricted, and uncuffed.",

Ocasio-Cortez said she invited public housing residents, many of whom chanted \u201chousing is a human right,\u201d that she and Sanders wanted them to help shape the legislation because other people are \u201ctoo far from the pain.\u201d \u201cPublic housing is one area of our infrastructure that\u2019s in immediate crisis that is actually threatening people\u2019s lives,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview with the Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect place for us to reimagine what a progressive economic agenda can do, particularly with a Green New Deal context.\u201d Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

      "content": " Bloomberg, who signaled his intention to jump into the crowded Democrat primary field this week by filing\u00a0paperwork to appear on the ballot in Arkansas\u2019 March 3 presidential primary, is failing to see any sort of significant support nationally, according to the latest\u00a0Reuters/Ipsos poll. The poll, which surveyed\u00a02,235 adults between November 12\u201314, 2019, showed only three percent of Democrats and independents supporting the former New York City mayor. Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) led in support with 19 percent, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) with 13 percent. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) followed with six percent support, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) fell to three percent, tying with Bloomberg despite a months-long presence in the race. The remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less:  More on the methodology: The sample includes 958 Democrats, 848 Republicans, and 249 independents. Weighting was then employed to balance demographics to ensure that the sample\u2019s composition reflects that of the adult population according to Census data and to provide results intended to approximate the sample universe. The precision of Ipsos online polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll is accurate to within \u00b1 2.4 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, had all Americans been polled. The credibility interval will be wider among subsets of the population. All sample surveys and polls may be subject to other sources of error, including, but not limited to coverage error, and measurement error. The poll also has a credibility interval \u00b1 3.6 percentage points for Democrats, \u00b1 3.8 percentage points for Republicans \u00b1 7.1 percentage points for independents. Bloomberg has not received a warm welcome from Democrats, particularly from Warren or Sanders. Most recently, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) took a veiled swipe at Bloomberg as well as other Democrats, who appear to be joining the race at the last minute. She wrote: Call me radical, but maybe instead of setting ablaze hundreds of millions of dollars on multiple plutocratic, long-shot, very-late presidential bids, we instead invest hundreds of millions into winning majorities of state legislatures across the United States?

He also vowed to \u201cexpunge past convictions of marijuana related offenses, and ensure that victims of the War on Drugs are not passed over by the burgeoning marijuana industry.\u201d Additionally, Sanders promised to reinvest in communities most impacted by the \u201cWar on Drugs.\u201d He said he will do that, in part, by creating a $10 billion federal program to help former convicts work in the marijuana industry. Per his plan, the program will \u201chelp disproportionately impacted areas and individuals who have been arrested for or convicted of marijuana offenses start urban and rural farms and urban and rural marijuana growing operations to ensure people impacted by the war on drugs have access to the entire marijuana industry.\u201d The federal programs will \u201cprovide formerly incarcerated individuals with training and resources needed to start their own businesses and worker owned businesses, and guarantee jobs and free job training at trade schools and apprenticeship programs related to marijuana businesses,\u201d according to his proposal.",

SCHIFF: The only times I prevented witnesses from answering questions along with our counsel was when it was apparent that members were seeking to out the whistleblower. We will do everything necessary to protect the whistleblower\u2019s identity, and I\u2019m disturbed to hear members of the committee who have in the past voiced strong support for whistleblower protections seek to undermine those protections by outing the whistleblower. STEFANIK: Mr. Chairman, only one member and their staff\u2014 SCHIFF: (INAUDIBLE) The gentlewoman\u2014 STEFANIK:\u2014on this committee has direct knowledge of the identity of the whistleblower. SCHIFF: The gentlewoman will suspend. You asked a parliamentary inquiry, and I am responding \u2014 or point of order, and I\u2019m responding. We will not permit the outing of the whistleblower, and questions along those lines, counsel will inform their clients not to respond to. If necessary, I will intervene. Otherwise, I want members to feel free to ask any questions they like. In another hearing, Stefanik used her time to read Schiff\u2019s own words on the importance of the whistleblower testifying aloud: \u201cAdam Schiff was adamant about the whistleblower testifying, Speaker Pelosi said she supported the whistleblower testifying. They only changed that statement when it became clear there was coordination with the whistleblower and Adam Schiff staffers,\u201d Stefanik told the\u00a0Post. \u201cI was the first member to ask when did Adam Schiff have access to the whistleblower,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s big deal because before this person was a whistleblower, they were coordinating with Democratic staff members who turned them into a whistleblower and advised them about the process,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe political rollout and communications rollout was just so orchestrated,\u201d she added. Stefanik\u2019s bold handling of the partisan impeachment inquiry earned her the praise of President Trump, who called her \u201ca new Republican Star\u201d: A new Republican Star is born.

Some members of the media, like Jess Bidgood of The Boston Globe, speculated that Biden\u2019s appeal to bipartisanship in the email may indicate he plans to focus his attacks on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) during Wednesday\u2019s debate.  Warren, until the recent rise of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, has been seen as Biden\u2019s biggest rival for the Democrat nomination. As such, the two have sparred openly over the direction of the Democrat Party. Biden, who claims to be the only Democrat able to win back the white working class in 2020, is campaigning as something of a moderate who will bring forth incremental change. The strategy is evident in the former vice president\u2019s policy platform, which is full of ideas that were seen as too radical during the Obama years but are now considered tepid when compared to those advocated by progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Warren, on the other hand, is a proponent of radical change, as exhibited by her endorsements of a wealth tax and the Green New Deal. The differences between the two have been evident in their recent back and forth on Medicare for All. Biden, who opposes the universal healthcare plan in favor of expanding the Affordable Care Act through a public option, has accused Warren and other supporters of Medicare for All of being dishonest. In particular, the former vice president has claimed Warren is lying about the true costs of Medicare for All and how she plans to fund the program. \u201cShe\u2019s making it up,\u201d the former vice president\u00a0told\u00a0PBS News Hour earlier this month\u00a0when asked about cost estimates Warren\u2019s campaign had released on the proposal: Look, nobody thinks it\u2019s $20 trillion. It\u2019s between 30 and $40 trillion. Every major independent study that\u2019s gone out there, that\u2019s taken a look at this, there is no way \u2014 even [Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)], who talks about the need to raise middle-class taxes, he can\u2019t even meet the cost of it.
