      "subtitle": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is working to elevate her status as one of the most outspoken pro-union presidential candidates and is expected to join teachers in Chicago on Tuesday as part of their ongoing strike, visiting a South Austin elementary school and \u201cpicketing with teachers and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten,\u201d according to local reports.",

      "content": " Thursday marked the first day of the\u00a0Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) strike, resulting in the cancellation of classes for the 361,000 K-12 students who attend Chicago Public Schools (CPS). The union and CPS have been unable to reach a negotiation on numerous issues, including salaries, benefits, and classroom size. Warren is expected to join them as they go into their fourth day of the strike. NBC Chicago reports: According to a campaign email, the stop in Chicago will be part of a two-stop swing for the Democratic presidential candidate on Tuesday. Warren will join striking teachers in Chicago at a South Austin elementary school on the city\u2019s West Side, picketing with teachers and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten. Warren has made tangible efforts to position herself as one of the most outspoken pro-union 2020 candidates,\u00a0joining\u00a0airport food workers in a minimum wage protest at Reagan National Airport in July:  On Labor Day, Warren called for \u201cstronger unions\u201d and declared that unions will \u201crebuild America\u2019s middle class.\u201d \u201cUnions built the middle class\u2014and unions will rebuild the middle class,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cIf we want more good American jobs, then we need stronger unions and more power in the hands of the people\u201d:      As for the CTU, negotiations are still underway, but progress, according to CTU President Jesse Sharkey, has halted. Sharkey\u00a0accused Chicago Mayor\u00a0Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration of \u201cvindictive actions\u201d and added that her recent letter \u201cdashed our hopes of a quick settlement,\u201d according to the Chicago Tribune. According to the report: Sharkey\u2019s accusation came after Lightfoot and Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson made a plea to teachers to end their strike before a settlement and continue negotiations while working without a contract, leading Sharkey to say after negotiations ended for the day that Lightfoot\u2019s letter had \u201cdashed our hopes for a quick settlement.\u201d Sharkey said in an email that their bargaining team was \u201cbeginning to see glimmers of progress on issues that matter to our members\u201d but added that progress \u201cstopped dead\u201d on Monday. \u201cIt was clear from the mayor\u2019s letter to the press demanding members go back to work\u00a0without a contract\u00a0and from the sudden atmosphere of stonewalling from the CPS team, that (Mayor Lori Lightfoot) had pulled the plug on negotiations,\u201d Sharkey wrote, according to the Chicago Tribune. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s team said that there was no more money in the budget to address the many outstanding demands that are necessary to deliver justice for our school communities,\u201d he added. While Lightfoot and CPS CEO Janice Jackson have said that \u201creal progress\u201d was being made, both made it clear that the strikes are hurting students. They wrote: For the fourth straight school day, students from throughout the city won\u2019t be participating in the athletic competitions they\u2019ve earned the right to compete in, won\u2019t be preparing their college applications with trusted school staff, and won\u2019t be in classrooms with the teachers who hold the keys to their success. \u201cWe must fix that immediately and end this strike,\u201d they added.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " While most national polls have shown a tight race between the former vice president and Sen. Elizabeth Warren in recent weeks \u2013 with Warren topping Biden in some cases \u2013 Morning Consult has consistently shown Biden leading the field. The current results, taken\u00a0Oct. 16-20, 2019, show Biden leading the field with 30 percent and Warren in second place with 21 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) came in third with 18 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), both of whom garnered six percent support each. Sen. Cory Booker (D), Beto O\u2019Rourke (D), and Andrew Yang (D) garnered three percent, and the remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. While there seems to be a disparity between the national polling results of Morning Consult and that of other polls, the trend remains the same. Morning Consult shows Biden on a slow decline \u2013 falling from a 40 percent high in May \u2013 and Warren rising, jumping from her seven percent low in March. Notably, though, is Biden\u2019s drop in favorability. The post-debate poll shows that Biden lost five favorability points following the last debate, dropping from 55 percent to 50 percent. Sanders\u2019 remained the same with 57 percent, and Warren\u2019s jumped by one point, from 52 percent to 53 percent. Additionally, Warren remains the top second choice for Biden voters, with 28 percent choosing her and 26 percent choosing Sanders. The results are not necessarily reciprocated, as the Sanders holds a slight edge, earning the second choice support from 25 percent of Warren voters compared to Biden\u2019s 24 percent. The Massachusetts senator remains the top second choice candidate for supporters of Sanders, Harris, and Buttigieg. The results of the survey are based on\u00a011,521 interviews with registered voters \u201cwho indicate they may vote in the Democratic primary or caucus.\u201d The margin of error is +/- 1 percent.",

Andrew Yang trails former Vice President Joe Biden by just one percent. Former Vice President Joe Biden sits at just 10 percent in the poll and Andrew Yang is close behind with nine percent. From the end of September through the beginning of October, student respondents actually preferred Yang to Biden. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) bring up the rear with Democratic college students, polling at four and three percent, respectively. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) received just one percent of the vote in the most recent poll. Breitbart News reported in August that Bernie Sanders was the most popular presidential candidate with Democratic college students. It is unclear, at this point, Sanders\u2019 early October heart attack has played in a role in his declining popularity. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.",

All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching,\u201d Trump wrote:  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) echoed the president\u2019s sentiments, blasting the Democrat-led impeachment effort as \u201cjoke,\u201d \u201cscam,\u201d and \u201cpolitical lynching.\u201d  White House spokesman Hogan Gidley spoke to reporters and noted that the current impeachment process lacks \u201cdue process.\u201d He added, \u201cThe president\u2019s not comparing what\u2019s happened to him to one of the country\u2019s darkest moments.\u201d The president\u2019s description of the partisan impeachment effort as a political \u201clynching\u201d drew ire from Democrats across the board, including a handful of 2020 candidates. \u201cLynching is a reprehensible stain on this nation\u2019s history, as is this President,\u201d Sen.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote. \u201cNobody is above the law, not even the president of the United States,\u201d she added:  The remark drew a reaction from more than just 2020 candidates. \u201cHaven\u2019t even had coffee yet & the occupant of the WH, the bigoted man who called for the execution of the exonerated 5, is tossing the word \u2018lynching\u2019 around,\u201d far-left \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep Ayanna Pressley wrote. \u201cLord give me the strength to not take the bait but hold this man accountable for every single thing he says and does,\u201d Pressley continued:  More:      Notably, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) accused Republicans of \u201crunning a lynch mob\u201d during Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment process in 1998. \u201cI am the president\u2019s defender in the sense that I haven\u2019t seen anything yet that would rise, in my opinion, to the level of impeachable offense,\u201d Nadler said at the time. \u201cI wish we could get this over with quickly,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn pushing the process, in pushing the arguments of fairness and due process the Republicans so far have been running a lynch mob,\u201d he added.

      "author": "John Carney",
      "content": " The Federal Reserve has been pumping tens of billions of dollars into the market for overnight and short-term repurchase agreements, or repos, for several weeks. On Tuesday, the Fed swapped $99 billion of cash for securities held by banks. In a letter addressed to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who chairs the Financial Stability Oversight Council, Warren asked the secretary to explain the causes of the market turmoil. She pointed out that many of the early attempts to explain the disruption\u2013including large corporates tax payments due in mid-September\u2013either never made much sense or fail to explain why the market continues to need so much additional liquidity. \u201cI am also concerned that, \u2018Big U.S. banks are using the recent chaos short funding markets as an opportunity to pressure the Federal Reserve to ease liquidity requirements they l1ave long despised,'\u201d Warren wrote, quoting from a Reuters report. The Fed imposed new liquidity requirements after the financial crisis in an effort to avoid having to bail out banks in the future. Banks are supposed to have enough liquid assets, primarily cash and Treasury bonds, that they could sustain a short-term market disruption. Prior to the new regulations, many large financial institutions were often just days away from collapse if they could not obtain short-term funding. Many on Wall Street now believe the liquidity regulations are playing a role in the problems with the short-term funding market, encouraging banks to \u201choard liquidity\u201d rather than lend it out. And, indeed, this is quickly becoming part of the case for reforming the liquidity requirements. ",

      "subtitle": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) took her 2020 campaign for the Democrat presidential nomination to Chicago on Tuesday, where she joined striking members of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) on the picket lines.",
      "author": "Michael Patrick Leahy",
      "content": " Warren said in a speech delivered to a crowd of teachers gathered on the picket lines in West Chicago: I\u2019m here to stand for America\u2019s public schools. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago\u2019s teachers. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago nurses. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago\u2019s librarians. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago\u2019s bus drivers. I\u2019m here to stand with the low wage workers in the Chicago schools. I also am here to stand with our unions. To stand with SEIU, to stand with CTU, and here\u2019s why\u2013because the unions are how we have a voice. The unions are how we have power. \u201cThe unions are how we make sure that the needs of every one of our children are heard loud and clear,\u201d she added. The Chicago Tribune reported\u00a0Warren\u2019s appearance came \u201chours after union President Jesse Sharkey accused Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration of \u2018vindictive actions\u2019 for suggesting the union go back to work without a contract and saying there was no more money for teacher demands.\u201d The strike began on Thursday morning, and Tuesday is the fourth day that classes have been cancelled for the 361,000 students who attend the Chicago Public Schools. In her speech,\u00a0Warren made no mention of the dismal academic performance of those students when compared to the national average, or the role the striking teachers have in failing to improve that performance. Earlier in her speech, Warren said, \u201ceveryone in America should support you in this strike. And the reason is because when you go out and fight, you don\u2019t just fight for yourselves, you fight for the children of this city, and the children of this country,\u201d adding: I believe in public education, and I believe it is time in America to make a new investment in public education. And I got a plan for that. America\u2019s public schools need a partner in Washington.Not a partner who\u2019s going to tell them what to do. Not a partner who\u2019s going to do high stakes testing. Not a partner who\u2019s going to pinch pennies. But a partner who\u2019s going to be there, to back you up in the critically important work you do every day. And for me, that start\u2019s with an $800 billion investment in our public schools. It starts with quadrupling our funding for title one schools. Let\u2019s level the playing field. It starts with full funding for IDEA for all of our children who are in special education. And it starts with a grant to every single public school in this country so that that public school can decide how to spend the money that it needs to provide the first rate education for the children it has. CTU President Jesse Sharkey made it clear on Tuesday he intends to play hard ball with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to get more money for the 25,000 teachers in his union, as The Tribune reported: In an email sent [to the Tribune] after midnight, Sharkey said, \u201cOur bargaining team was beginning to see glimmers of progress on issues that matter to our members. (Monday) that progress stopped dead. \u201cIt was clear from the mayor\u2019s letter to the press demanding members go back to work without a contract and from the sudden atmosphere of stonewalling from the CPS team, that (Lightfoot) had pulled the plug on negotiations,\u201d Sharkey continued. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s team said that there was no more money in the budget to address the many outstanding demands that are necessary to deliver justice for our school communities,\u201d he said. Tuesday\u2019s rally was kicked off by Brandon Johnson, who declared he is \u201ca proud member of the Chicago Teachers Union. I am also proud to be the Cook County Commissioner of the First District.\u201d Johnson said: This moment has been brought to you by the largest political resistance that we\u2019ve seen in a generation. For those that have taken us for granted for the last 35 years, the Chicago Teachers Union and SEIU we\u2019re saying enough is enough. We\u2019re not going to turn back now. \u201cWe are going to secure economic justice today,\u201d he added, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the national union with which the CTU is affiliated, also addressed the crowd: I feel like I have been in Chicago so much the last few weeks that I probably have to start paying property taxes. It shouldn\u2019t have taken, as [CTU President] Jesse [Sharkey] said, to the brink of a strike in order to have real negotiations. There were more negotiations in the first two days of the strike than in the last ten months, that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with this bargaining process. You can see Warren\u2019s full remarks here, in this YouTube video posted by the American Federation of Teachers:  ",

Yet Biden\u2019s support jumped ten points from the last poll taken in September, from 24 percent to 34 percent. Warren only increased her support by one percent. Biden was also targeted by President Donald Trump for corruption in recent weeks, as the president attacked Biden\u2019s son Hunter for his shady foreign business deals in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president. A big majority of moderate/conservative Democrat voters chose Biden as their first choice; 43 percent to Warren\u2019s 12 percent and Bernie Sanders ten percent.

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " The big news today is a poll from the far-left CNN, which shows former Vice President Joe Biden surging to a 34 to 19 percent lead over Warren, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) hanging on \u2014 heart attack and all \u2014 to third place with 16 percent support. Granted, this is only one poll, and it is CNN, but if Biden is indeed at 34 percent nationally, that is about where a frontrunner needs to be. Thirty-five percent is considered the safe zone in a crowded race. While I don\u2019t have an enormous amount of faith in CNN\u2019s polling, comparing the trends within a particular poll is always useful, and those look especially bad for America\u2019s Favorite Fake Indian. Since June, in this same poll, Warren\u2019s favorability number has climbed just two points, from 36 to 38 percent, but her unfavorable rating has also climbed, from 38 to 41 percent. Most importantly, she is upside down on favorability, 38 to 41 percent, and the only top tier Democrat candidate with that problem. By comparison, Sanders enjoys 48 to 45 percent favorability rating. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is right-side up at 28 to 23 percent. Joe Biden enjoys an incredible advantage at 74 to 20 percent. On the top four issues of the day, Biden enjoys a wide lead among Democrats. On foreign policy, 56 percent say Biden will do the best job, compared to 13 percent for Sanders and just 11 percent for Warren. On the economy, it\u2019s Biden 38 percent, Sanders 19 percent, and Warren 16 percent. On guns , it\u2019s Biden 27 percent, Sanders 13 percent, and Warren 11 percent. On immigration, it\u2019s Biden 29 percent, with Warren and Sanders tied at 16 percent. In worse news for Chief Lies-Like-a-Rug, Warren is slipping everywhere else. Two weeks ago, in the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Warren was tied with Biden nationally and even led in a number of polls. In the seven most recent polls, however, Biden has a steady lead; in six of those polls he leads anywhere from 8 to 15 points. The real problem for Warren, though, is that she wilts under scrutiny. As soon as the \u201cfrontrunner\u201d status swung the spotlight her way, everything that makes Elizabeth Warren a terrible candidate was once again magnified times ten. On top of her extremist policies, she\u2019s a weak, shrill, dishonest neurotic. During this last debate, there was nothing to instill confidence among those looking for someone tough enough to take on Trump, especially when she dissembled over and over again when asked a simple question about how she intends to pay for her Medicare For All plan without raising taxes on the middle class. The primary thing voters look for in a candidate is strength and competence. Are they strong, unable to be rattled? Are you the alpha male (or female)? But whenever she\u2019s under pressure Warren unravels like Lucy Ricardo when Ricky catches her sneaking into his nightclub. In short, Elizabeth Warren is a mess. This was obvious \u2014 hell, everything was obvious about Warren\u2019s inability to handle pressure after she bungled the release of her DNA results last year. As I said at the time, that was the single worst political debacle since John McCain suspended his 2008 presidential campaign to run off and save the economy. She made a fool of herself, and that is almost impossible to overcome. For that reason, I was legitimately surprised when she became the frontrunner earlier this month, but I was not at all surprised when she immediately fell apart as soon as the scrutiny arrived. She just doesn\u2019t have The Stuff. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.",

Kamala Harris\u2019s (D-CA) continued tailspin, dropping behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s (D), who saw six percent support to Harris\u2019s five percent. Andrew Yang (D) experienced a slight bump, garnering four percent support, followed by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with three percent each. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. Results also show that Sanders, who just received the formal endorsement of young, freshman socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), continues to have a stronghold on younger voters (18-29) with 45 percent of their support. No one else comes close, as Warren gains 17 percent support from that age group, and Yang is right behind her, earning 15 percent support. While Biden only sees 12 percent support among young voters, his backing increases exponentially among\u00a0older voters. He is garnering 17 percent support from those aged 30-49 and 44 percent support from those 50 and older. The economy remains the most important issue for 31 percent of voters in deciding whom to support in the presidential election, \u201cfollowed by social issues at 14%, healthcare at 13%, impeachment at 11%, immigration at 10% and the environment at 8%,\u201d according to the poll\u2019s results. \u201cGun policy and education are tied at 5%, and foreign policy is the least important issue for voters at 4%,\u201d it adds.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The poll, taken October 1-3, among 887 likely U.S. voters, shows the president edging out all of his potential Democrat challengers, minus Warren, who tied with Trump with 45 percent support. Notably, ten percent said they were \u201cnot sure\u201d who they would vote for between the two. While many Democrats view Biden as the most electable candidate, the survey\u2019s results show Trump defeating Biden 47 percent to 45 percent thanks, in part, to the president closing the gap in support among independent, suburban, and Hispanics voters. According to Zogby Analytics: The reason President Trump is winning, barely, in a hypothetical match-up with the former vice president, Joe Biden, is that, in addition to winning with his normal base of men (Trump leads 54% to 39%), white voters (Trump leads 53% to 40%), union voters (Trump leads 62% to 32%), and southern voters (Trump leads 50% to 43%), Trump has also tightened the race with Independents (Biden leads 42% to 36%), suburban voters (Biden leads 49% to 43%), and Hispanics (Biden leads 47% to 43%). Trump is also beating Biden convincingly with two demographics he has recently made inroads with: large city voters (Trump leads 50% to 44%) and Generation X voters age 30-49 (Trump leads 49% to 41%). Trump also beats Sanders by a two-point margin, 46 percent to 44 percent, although Sanders continues to hold an edge with younger voters (18-29) with 56 percent support to Trump\u2019s 37 percent. The president appears to perform the best against Buttigieg, who has failed to break through the top tier of candidates in the crowded Democrat field. Trump beats him by 11 points \u2013 49 percent to 38 percent \u2013 and defeats Harris 47 percent to 41 percent. The margin of error is +/- 3.3 percent.  The poll emphasizes that 2020 results will largely hinge on voter turnout\u2013 a point emphasized in\u00a0Moody\u2019s Analytics 2020 election forecast. As Breitbart News reported: If turnout by Democrats and independents voting against Trump is low to average, Trump easily wins under the models. If it climbs to the historical maximum, Trump would lose under the stock market and unemployment models but still win in the pocketbook model. The results, or general sentiment of Trump defeating his rivals in hypothetical general election matchups, is reflected in the latest poll from the Economist/YouGov: ",

Revenue for the period was $823.7 million, versus the $874 million expected. For the third quarter, \u201cwe discovered, and took steps to remediate bugs that primarily affected our legacy Mobile Application Promotion (MAP) product, impacting our ability to target ads and share data with measurement and ad partners,\u201d Twitter said in its letter to shareholders. \u201cWe also experienced greater-than-expected seasonality in our advertising business that began in July and continued into August.\u201d Twitter said these issues negatively impacted year-over-year revenue growth for the period. Advertising revenue hit $702 million for the third quarter, which was up from the same period last year, but also failed to match analyst expectations. Twitter also published fourth-quarter guidance that fell short of expectations. The company is forecasting total revenue to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion for the period, which is below the $1.06 billion that Wall Street is expecting. In recent weeks, Twitter has found itself in the middle of a Democratic skirmish over whether President Donald Trump should be banned from the platform. Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) has called on Twitter to give President Trump the boot, claiming that he incites \u201cfear\u201d and that he made comments about the so-called White House \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d But rival candidates Sen.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) fell to third place, trailing Buttigieg by two points with 18 percent support. Most significantly, perhaps, is Biden\u2019s fourth-place status, garnering just 12 percent support \u2013 a four-point drop from September\u2019s results. The poll shows Sen.

While the presidential hopefuls are vying to win over early primary state voters, a candidate\u2019s support in their respective home state \u2013 particularly among those who are currently serving as a lawmaker \u2013 can speak volumes. The California lawmaker is failing to capture support from residents of her home state, falling to fourth place, a\u00a0Change Research\u00a0poll shows.

One of the most significant takeaways from the poll is Sanders\u2019 slow regain, coming in third place with 15 percent support. The last\u00a0Quinnipiac University Poll, taken prior to the October 15 debate, showed Sanders polling at 11 percent. The poll also shows Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with a notable boost, coming in fourth place with ten percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with five percent support. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered three percent support, with the remaining candidates seeing two percent support or less. The margin of error is\u00a0+/- 4.6 percent. While voters still view Biden as the most viable candidate in a matchup against Trump, that position is slipping. According to Quinnipiac: Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, but he is not as strong on this question as he once was. In today\u2019s poll, Biden gets 42 percent, but this is down from 48 percent in the October 14 poll and his high of 56 percent in an April 30 poll. Warren comes in second on this electability question with 20 percent, followed by Sanders at 14 percent. Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic candidate for president by 28 percent of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, followed by Biden and Warren who receive 15 percent apiece, and Buttigieg with 11 percent. Sanders and Warren are at the top on the question of which candidate \u201ccares most about people like you,\u201d as Sanders gets 28 percent, Warren receives 24 percent, and Biden gets 14 percent. The October Quinnipiac University Poll showed Warren with\u00a030 percent to Biden\u2019s 27 percent, indicating that Sanders\u2019 slow regain is affecting the top two candidates in an impactful way. \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,\u201d Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said of the poll\u2019s results. Warren\u2019s extended lead over Biden and Sanders\u2019 bump follows a CNN poll released this week, showing the former vice president as the clear frontrunner with 34 percent to Warren\u2019s 19 percent and Sanders\u2019 16 percent.",

      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) also voiced support for ammunition controls and background checks. She did not mention that the U.S. has had background checks since 1998.  On August 15, 2019, Breitbart News reported Warren\u2019s promise of\u00a0\u201cexecutive action in every corner\u201d for gun control, should she be elected. On October 2, 2019, Breitbart News reported Warren\u2019s push for a federal limit on the number of guns an American can purchase. She admitted that limited gun purchases will not solve gun violence by itself, suggesting it is\u00a0\u201cnot a one and done\u201d issue, but a very broad issue requiring numerous laws, regulations, changes. On October 15, 2019, Breitbart News reported Warren\u2019s plan to use excise taxes to reduce firearm and ammunition sales. The plan to use excise taxes was\u00a0published\u00a0by Medium where readers saw Warren\u2019s belief that the current ten percent excise tax on firearms is too low. She made clear she wants to raise that tax to 30 percent while increasing the tax on ammunition to 50 percent. This would immediately raise the price of a $500 gun to $650 and would increase the price of a $20 box of ammo to $30. Such taxation could render the Second Amendment cost-prohibitive for the poor.

      "subtitle": "Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is reversing its position on accepting help from super PACs amid anemic fundraising.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Kate Bedingfield, the former vice president\u2019s deputy campaign manager, announced the decision on Thursday, framing it as a result of the President Donald Trump\u2019s willingness to \u201cintervene directly\u201d in the Democrat\u2019s primary process. Claiming that the president and his allies were already \u201cspending massive amount[s] of money\u201d to prevent Biden from becoming the nominee, Bedingfield said the campaign had no choice to abandon its earlier pledge to discourage the aid of super Pacs. \u201cIn this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to this disastrous presidency,\u201d Bedingfield said. \u201cNothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.\u201d  The move comes as Biden\u2019s campaign struggles to keep up in fundraising in comparison to candidates like South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT). Although the former vice president started his campaign with a strong funding advantage, thanks in part to high-dollar donors, he ended the most recent fundraising period well behind his competitors. In particular, Biden only raised $15.2 million in the third quarter of this year, far below the sums brought in by Sanders ($25.3 million), Buttigieg ($19.1 million), and Warren ($24.6 million). Posing more of a problem for the former vice president, however, is that his campaign has spent heavily since announcing in late-April, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand. Biden\u2019s cash crunch results from his inability to make in-roads with small-dollar donors. Unlike Warren or Sanders,\u00a0more than\u00a02,800 donors\u00a0have already\u00a0maxed\u00a0out to Biden\u2019s campaign since his announcement in late April, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In fact, top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden\u2019s campaign\u2019s coffers than those of his competitors. In comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign\u2019s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he\u2019s secured the nomination.\u00a0David Kochel, the former chief strategist for Jeb Bush\u2019s failed 2016 presidential bid,\u00a0explained\u00a0the problem to\u00a0Politico\u00a0this month. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have that perpetual, low-dollar fundraising machine, you can\u2019t compete,\u201d Kochel said. \u201cBiden looks like he can\u2019t compete with Warren, Bernie and Buttigieg. How\u2019s he going to compete with Trump?\u201d As evidenced by its decision on Thursday, the campaign appears to have decided his best way forward is to rely on super PACs, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited funds. Such groups are increasingly being scorned on the left \u2014 including Biden just a few short months ago. When first announcing his campaign, the former vice president pledged not to accept any campaign donations from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists. Part of that pledge was also his assurance not accept money from super PACs, even going as far to discourage one that had already formed on his behalf. \u201cVice President Biden does not welcome assistance from super PACs,\u201d a campaign aide told the Huffington Post in April when asked about the PAC. As part of its reasoning for rejecting the help, the Biden campaign pointed to the former vice president\u2019s long record of championing campaign finance reform. The candidate, himself, elaborated on his position during an interview with PBS News Hour last year while discussing campaign finance advice he purportedly gave to Sanders in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m the guy that told him, you shouldn\u2019t accept any money from a super PAC, because people can\u2019t possibly trust you,\u201d Biden said at the time. \u201cHow will a middle-class guy accept you if you accept money?\u201d",

      "author": "Charlie Spiering",
      "content": " An Iowa State University poll released Thursday showed Buttigieg surging into second place, behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Buttigieg now has 20 percent support, up seven points from last month and Warren has 28 percent, up four points. The Iowa State University poll featured 598 likely Democratic Caucus attendees in Iowa from October 18-22 and was conducted online. A Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll of Iowa Democrats released Monday showed Buttigieg up seven points from an earlier primary survey released in June. The new poll showed Buttigeg was in third place with 13 percent while Biden had 18 percent and Warren had 17 percent. The Suffolk poll featured 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers. An Emerson poll released last week showed the South Bend mayor at 16 percent, below Warren and Biden with 23 percent each. The Emerson poll featured 317 Democrat caucus voters. Buttigieg made a conscious effort to paint himself in the fourth presidential debate on CNN as a safer alternative to radical Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and emphasized his willingness to \u201cheal\u201d the nation after defeating President Donald Trump in 2020. That marked a quiet change from his earlier attempts to gain attention from the left by campaigning as a quiet radical ready to remake the Supreme Court, a proposal that even Ruth Bader-Ginsburg opposed. Buttigeig also continues to enjoy friendly press coverage from the establishment media, as many pundits and analysts are eager for a safe alternative to Biden and the more leftist candidates. Seventy-six percent of Democrats described Buttigieg as honest in the ISU poll while only 63 percent said the same about Joe Biden. The South Bend Mayor also has former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke to thank for pushing policies widely out of step with Iowa voters, including mandatory gun confiscation and getting rid of tax-exempt status for churches not willing to embrace gay marriage. Buttigieg pushed back against both proposals, which he argued were politically difficult to achieve. \u201c[T]he idea that you\u2019re going to strip churches of their tax-exempt status if they haven\u2019t found their way towards blessing same-sex marriage, I\u2019m not sure he understood the implications of what he was saying,\u201d Buttigieg said in response to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal. O\u2019Rourke is also among the few Democrat rivals that targeted Buttigieg directly for not being radical enough on gun control. But Buttigieg successfully fought back in the fourth debate, telling the former Texas Congressman, \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.\u201d O\u2019Rourke is now in 11th place in the Iowa State University poll with only one percent support.",

Mr. Soros, pointing a finger in the air, called China \u201ca mortal enemy\u201d and said the West gave it too much of the benefit of the doubt. \u201cWe should recognize it: It\u2019s a different system. It\u2019s totally opposed to ours, diametrically opposed to ours,\u201d he said. Perhaps to qualify his words, he added: \u201cI\u2019m not anti-Chinese at all. I\u2019m just anti Xi Jinping.\u201d Soros\u2019s words echo an op-ed he published in the Wall Street Journal last month in which he praised President Donald Trump\u2019s policy of confronting China as a \u201cgreat achievement.\u201d Though Soros told the\u00a0Times that he expected the political pendulum to swing back to \u201cglobalists\u201d (his word), and said he expected Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to be the Democratic Party nominee (without endorsing her), his feelings on China are firmly in line with those of the Trump administration.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Biden confidently proclaimed during an interview with CBS Evening News on Friday he is the Democrat frontrunner and claimed he is not concerned with how much money his competitors have in the bank. \u201cI know I\u2019m the frontrunner. Find me a national poll with a notable \u2013 a couple exceptions. The last four that have come out \u2013 but look, this is a marathon,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis is a marathon.\u201d \u201cYou have less than $9 million in the bank. Bernie Sanders has $30 \u2013 nearly $34 million in the bank. Sen. Warren has $26 million. How do you compete against that?\u201d CBS anchor\u00a0Norah O\u2019Donnell asked. \u201cI just flat beat them,\u201d Biden said, adding that his campaign is on a course to do \u201cextremely well.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to fund this campaign,\u201d he continued. \u201d I really am not, truly.\u201d His campaign\u2019s actions, however, do not match up with the presidential hopeful\u2019s rhetoric. His campaign on Thursday essentially modified its position on accepting Super PAC support and blamed President Trump for using advertising to \u201cintervene directly\u201d in the Democrat primaries in an effort to take down Biden. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,\u201d Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said in a statement. She continued: He and his allies are already spending massive\u00a0amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee. Both Warren and Sanders wasted no time to slam Biden for reversing course. Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said the Biden campaign is essentially trying to \u201cbuy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations.\u201d Shakir\u2019s campaign statement, via Bern Notice,\u00a0reads: Joe Biden has spent his campaign promising elite donors that nothing will fundamentally change for them, and he has made clear to fossil fuel and pharmaceutical donors that he will be their ally. As a result, he has had trouble generating significant grassroots support from Americans who are getting crushed by those same big donors \u2014 and so his supporters are suddenly begging for help from super PACs, even though they are vehicles for the kind of corporate corruption that Democrats should be fighting to stop. Let\u2019s be clear: super PACs exist for one reason and one reason only: to help billionaires and corporations bankroll a presidential campaign with unlimited amounts of money, in exchange for favors. Every Democratic candidate should forcefully reject any help from super PACs \u2014 and they should tell their supporters and surrogates to stop engaging with super PACs that aim to buy elections and undermine our democracy. Sanders also criticized Biden during a town hall event in Marshalltown, Iowa, on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t need a super PAC. I am not going to be controlled by a handful of wealthy people. I will be controlled by the working people of this country,\u201d he said. Similarly, Warren \u2013 who has pledged to refrain from attending big fundraisers and courting wealthy donors despite doing so during her senatorial bids and transferring leftover funds to cushion her presidential run \u2013 took a shot a Biden on social media but did not call him out by name. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that any Democratic candidate would reverse course and endorse the use of unlimited contributions from the wealthy to run against fellow Democrats,\u201d Warren said. \u201cA handful of wealthy donors should not be allowed to buy the Democratic nomination,\u201d she continued. That\u2019s not who we are.\u201d \u201cEvery Democratic candidate should agree: Super PACs have no place in our primary,\u201d she added:  ",

And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely,\u201d a source said, according to the\u00a0Post. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is reportedly conducting himself the same way, telling those close to him that he would consider jumping in the race if Biden falters. \u201cBloomberg is in if Biden is out,\u201d a \u201cNew York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,\u201d told CNBC.

While Bloomberg\u2019s presence does not appear to make a significant impact, Biden\u2019s absence and Clinton\u2019s addition would cause Sen.

      "content": " The former vice president, who this week reversed his position on accepting help from super PACs, made the remarks when asked by CBS News\u2019s Norah O\u2019Donnell if he still considered himself the Democrat frontrunner. O\u2019Donnell, particularly, noted that Biden had not only lost his polling advantage but had also fallen behind competitors like Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in fundraising. \u201cI just flat beat them,\u201d Biden responded with a laugh before adding that his campaign was \u201con a course to do extremely well.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly.\u201d Despite the former vice president\u2019s bravado, his campaign has expressed increasing concern over its fundraising capabilities in the past few weeks. \u201cI hate to say it, but our opponents are way ahead of us when it comes to money in the bank,\u201d Elana Firsht, a campaign aide, admitted in a recent fundraising email. \u201cIf we don\u2019t pick up the pace here, we might have to make budget cuts that could seriously hurt our momentum in this primary.\u201d Although Biden started the race with a strong funding advantage, thanks to support from high-dollar donors, he ended the most recent fundraising period well behind his competitors. In between July and the end of September, Biden only raised $15.2 million. The sum was dwarfed by that raised by Sanders ($25.3 million), Warren ($24.6 million), and\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million). Compounding the problem is that the former vice president\u2019s campaign has spent on luxury travel, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand.

Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he has secured the nomination. Biden\u2019s cash crunch was seen as the primary motivator for his campaign\u2019s decision to jettison its stance of discouraging super PACs, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited funds, on Thursday. The move came even after Biden had made a show this year of pledging to pass stronger restrictions on super PACs and dark money groups if elected president. \u201cOur Constitution doesn\u2019t begin with the phrase, \u2018We the Democrats\u2019 or \u2018We the Republicans,'\u201d Biden said at a campaign event in May. \u201cAnd it certainly doesn\u2019t begin with the phrase, \u201cWe the Donors.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "The Democrat presidential hopefuls want you to believe that they have a plan for raising taxes on the rich. And maybe, if one of them wins next year, they will, in fact, nick the rich a little\u2014but don\u2019t count on it.",
      "author": "James P. Pinkerton",
      "content": " After all, the last two Democrat presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, also campaigned on raising taxes on the wealthy, and yet during their time in office, the effective tax rate on top earners actually fell. Still, the left likes to say that its goal is to \u201ccomfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.\u201d And yet maybe that\u2019s just a campaign routine. Maybe sometimes the truth is closer to, afflict the afflicted, and comfort the comfortable. How so? Well, one way of making the comfortable even more comfortable is by legalizing prostitution. That way, for those so inclined, the man\u2014or woman\u2014who has everything can have even more of everything, with no fear of the prudish police. A case in point is Elizabeth Warren, whom the betting markets consider to be the Democrat most likely to win the 2020 nomination. On October 10, Warren tweeted some news sure to cheer rich johns\u2014and, of course, poor- and middle-income johns, too: \u201cI am open to decriminalizing sex work. Sex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy and are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse.\u201d We might translate some of this jargon-y code into simple English: \u201cSex work\u201d is the politically correct way of saying prostitution, while \u201cdecriminalizing\u201d really means legalizing, and \u201copen to\u201d means I\u2019m in favor of it, but, I just can\u2019t say so before the election. So yes, legalizing prostitution is a part of Warren\u2019s agenda. Indeed, at least four other Democrat presidential hopefuls\u2014Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, and Bernie Sanders\u2014have also declared their support, to some degree or another, for sex-worker \u201cdecriminalization.\u201d Indeed, such decriminalization is on the Democrats\u2019 to-do list in, of all places, the nation\u2019s capital. Here\u2019s a Washington Post headline from October 18: \u201cD.C. leaders hear from public over proposal to decriminalize sex work.\u201d As the article detailed, the Washington, DC, City Council will be voting on the matter in November. Fortunately, passage of the measure is far from assured; in fact, opponents are vocal and articulate. One opponent, Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, was blunt about what would happen if the bill passes: \u201cBecause this demand [for paid sex] cannot be met locally, traffickers will bring prostituted women and girls from other jurisdictions.\u201d And so, Van Pelt continued, \u201cD.C., the capital of our nation, would undoubtedly become a sex tourism destination.\u201d In the words of another opponent, Yasmin Vafa, executive director of Rights4Girls, \u201cThis bill is a sex trafficker\u2019s dream.\u201d Covering the same story, the New York Times added: All sides agree that prostitution practiced openly\u00a0would reverberate well beyond the city\u2019s thriving but shadowy sex industry of street prostitution, massage parlors, strip clubs and high-end call girls.\u00a0 Prostitutes would most likely work openly out of homes in neighborhoods across the city.\u00a0 Certain blocks could become de facto red-light districts. In other words, D.C. wouldn\u2019t just be the swamp, it would be the sex swamp. Yes, the reader can add any joke he or she might wish about politicians and/or lobbyists having new competition for whoredom, and yet still, it\u2019s not amusing to think that the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial would be joined by the Hooker Hotel. Yet we can further add a class dimension to the matter. That is, legal prostitution streamlines the process by which the rich buy\u2014or at least rent\u2014the bodies of the non-rich. Not every rich person is a customer, of course; plenty of fat cats are happily, and loyally, married. And yet it\u2019s also true that the rich tend to spend more money on everything. Let\u2019s ask ourselves: Who has the most money to spend on prostitutes? Who can bid the highest price for flesh? So we see more clearly that the rich have the most to gain from legalizing sex work. A case in point is Bob Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots football team. We all remember Kraft and his brush with the vice squad; back in February, the \u201cmasseuse\u201d who allegedly serviced him was busted on a prostitution rap. As for Kraft himself, he had better lawyers, of course, and so he wasn\u2019t arrested. Indeed, his pricy attorneys are battling with prosecutors as of this writing; back in May, they persuaded a judge to toss out the video evidence, and so there\u2019s no way to know how Kraft\u2019s case will ultimately be adjudicated. Robert Kraft (Getty Images) We just know this much: The optics have been horrible for Kraft. He would have been a lot happier if he could have just gone in and out, with no pesky police paying attention. Of course, prostitution is not just for billionaires; it\u2019s for any horndog with excess cash. And when it comes to disposable income, Democrats are way ahead. In fact, the ten richest congressional districts in the U.S. are represented by Democrats, as are 41 of the richest 50 districts. So with President Warren\u2014or with any of the other pro-decriminalization Democrats\u2013in the White House it seems likely that the laissez-faire approach to sex will become federal policy. And as we know, laissez-faire always works best for the rich. Thus naughty Democrats, even non-plutocrats, would have a new category of pleasure on which to spend their money, legally. To be sure, a pro-prostitution Department of Justice might not be able to override state and local laws (although, of course, we should never underestimate the power of liberal lawyers, working with liberal judges and the American Civil Liberties Union to think of tricky end-runs around traditional morality). In any case, without a doubt, a Warren-ized DOJ would take some of the pressure off interstate and international and sex-trafficking. And that\u2019s good news for Bob Kraft-types, both in America and coming from around the world. Moreover, such a hands-off approach would be even better news for the next Jeffrey Epstein. We can recall that the late (we presume) Epstein had an international racket going, bringing in women and girls from Eastern Europe, and sending them on the \u201cLolita Express\u201d\u2014to the Caribbean, New Mexico, even Thailand\u2014for pimpy purposes. Jeffrey Epstein appears in court in West Palm Beach, Florida, on July 30, 2008. (Uma Sanghvi/AP Photo) So while Warren and the other Democrats have said nothing about changing age-of-consent laws\u2014sex with minors being the peculiar predilection of Epstein and, apparently, of other of his rich associates\u2014it\u2019s obvious that if prosecutors have fewer points of leverage on the sex trade, then Epstein-type abuses are more likely to emerge. Thus we can see: Legalizing prostitution would be a great comfort to many among the comfortable. Yet at the same time, Warren\u2019s plan would further afflict the afflicted. Few, if any, women truly want to be prostitutes, and yet if the global magnet of money\u2014complete with marketing and hyping\u2014is turned on and allowed to operate at full power, well, a lot of women, and girls, will be pulled, and pushed, into prostitution. We can observe: This is not liberation, it\u2019s degradation. It\u2019s not empowerment, it\u2019s a kind of slavery\u2014indeed, it used to be called white slavery. But wait\u2014there\u2019s more! More, that is, to the Democrats\u2019 plan to comfort the comfortable. You see, not only does Warren want to decriminalize prostitution, she also wants to decriminalize crossing the U.S. border. In other words, every trans-national pimp and procurer will have an easier time bringing nubile bodies across the border\u2014no nosy border guards asking questions and getting in the way. Fittingly, on October 8, Breitbart News\u2019s John Binder analyzed Warren\u2019s overall immigration plan, dubbing it a \u201cdonor class immigration plan.\u201d Notably, Warren\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t include mandatory E-Verify for employers and employees, and so once again, it will be all the easier for sex workers to work\u2014having come from anywhere in the world, regardless of their legal status. To sum up, Warren offers a trifecta for comforting the comfortable: First, legalize sex work; second, legalize anyone crossing the border; and third, do little if anything about hiring non-citizens. So yes, if she wins, Warren may raise rich people\u2019s taxes. And yet for the randier of the rich, it\u2019s a sweet tradeoff; they\u2019ll pay more in taxes, but her policy platform offers them a happy ending.",

Warren\u2019s immigration plan includes decriminalizing illegal immigration and providing amnesty to all 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. \u2014 policies that will force America\u2019s working class to compete for scarce blue-collar and middle-income jobs against the world\u2019s migrants. Likewise, Warren has championed the donor class and Chamber of Commerce\u2019s effort to increase legal immigration to the U.S. and thus driving up foreign competition against middle class and college-educated Americans. Current immigration levels are already helping to hand electoral dominance to Democrats nationwide, research by the New York Times, Axios, and the Atlantic has noted. The U.S. is set to bring\u00a0at least 15 million\u00a0new foreign-born voters to the country in the next decade. These voters\u2019 swing towards Democrats has\u00a0been realized\u00a0in the 2016 presidential election, where despite winning almost 50 percent of native-born Americans, Trump lost foreign-born voters to Hillary Clinton by 64 percent.

CPS CEO Janice Jackson joined Lightfoot in a rare Sunday night news conference in which the mayor blasted the Chicago Teachers Union over the impasse in contract talks. \u201cWe are enormously disappointed that CTU cannot simply take yes for an answer,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cAs of today, we\u2019ve put everything we could \u2014 responsibly \u2014 on the table in an attempt to get a deal done, but we have no deal to announce today,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cFor that, I am terribly disappointed.\u201d \u201cCPS said as of 4 p.m., the Chicago Teachers Union said there was no possibility of a deal before the end of the day on Sunday. As a result, CPS said, it will not be possible to hold classes Monday,\u201d CBS Chicago\u00a0reported\u00a0late Sunday. As a result the 361,000 K-12 students who attend public schools in Chicago will miss their eighth consecutive day of classes, disrupting the lives of parents and students alike. Twenty-five thousand teachers, members of the American Federation of Teachers\u2019 affiliated CTU, as well as an estimated 8,000 support staff, members of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) remain at strike. The current strike is now the longest teachers strike in the city since 1987. A gap of millions of dollars separates negotiators from the CTU and the CPS. The CTU says the gap is $38 million, while the CPS claims it is $100 million, the Sun\u2013Times reported on Sunday. The CTU has mounted an aggressive public communications campaign to attack Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s negotiation stance, especially on Twitter:     The strike has drawn attention and support from all the major Democrat candidates for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination. Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) joined the picket lines in West Chicago, declaring \u201cthe unions are how we have power.\u201d\n\nLost in the political power struggle between the teachers union and the city is the fact the academic performance of K-12 students who attend Chicago Public Schools has been well below national averages for decades, and shows little sign of improvement.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Whereas, Trump congratulated former President Obama\u00a0after he announced the raid that resulted in the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011. The president announced the death of\u00a0al-Baghdadi on Sunday, praising U.S. Special Operations forces, who \u201caccomplished their mission in grand style.\u201d \u201cThe thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread \u2014 terrified of the American forces bearing down on him,\u201d Trump said, detailing the moment the terrorist ignited his suicide vest after finding himself entrapped by U.S. forces. While 2020 candidates reacted to the news, many omitted any mention of the president\u2019s role, despite the fact that \u2013 as Trump noted \u2013 \u201ccapturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority\u201d of his administration. \u201cI congratulate our special forces, our intelligence community, and all our brave military professionals on delivering justice to the terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The world is better and safer without him in it,\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden (D) wrote, omitting any mention of Trump:  \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi led a campaign of mass violence and terror that devastated the region and threatened the world. His death is a setback for ISIS and a victory for justice,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote. \u201cI am grateful for the skill and courage of our special operations and intelligence professionals,\u201d she continued, noting that his death is \u201cnot the end of our fight against terrorism\u201d:  \u201cThe removal of al-Baghdadi from the battlefield is a credit to our armed forces & intelligence community who have committed years of service in the fight against ISIS & violent extremism,\u201d Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful to them, the Kurds & other allies & partners as we continue the fight ahead,\u201d he added:  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), in his initial response, thanked the \u201cKurds and other U.S. allies\u201d but failed to mention Trump or U.S. troops:  \u201cISIS has caused immeasurable suffering & destruction; the death of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was an important, much needed action to defeat it,\u201d Marianne Williamson (D) said. \u201cPraise and thanks for the military bravery and brilliance that carried out the mission\u201d:  \u201cAl-Baghdadi was a dangerous terrorist who committed heinous crimes. As I said this morning, getting rid of him was good for America and the world. But as I discussed today on @FaceTheNation many challenges remain,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) wrote:  \u201cA ruthless murderer has been brought to justice. I\u2019m grateful to our military and intelligence community. Their courage and dedication inspire us all,\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) said, also omitting any mention of the president. \u201cAbandoning our Syrian and Kurdish partners remains a disastrous decision that will make the fight against ISIS harder,\u201d he added:  \u201cThank you and congratulations to our special operations forces and others involved in tracking and getting rid of ISIS/Daesh leader Baghdadi,\u201d Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) responded, actively bashing what she calls Trump\u2019s \u201cshort-sighted policies\u201d in the remainder of her statement:  Andrew Yang (D) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) were among the most generous in their responses, although neither directly congratulated the president. \u201cThe death of al-Baghdadi is a major blow to ISIS and a testament to our armed forces. It will make the world safer,\u201d Yang wrote. While he did not mention Trump by name, he extended his congratulations to the special ops team \u201cthat executed the mission and everyone in the chain of command\u201d:  \u201cThis is a blow against ISIS and an important step in the fight against stateless terrorism. Credit should go to all who were involved; above all to the brave Americans in uniform and intelligence professionals who risked their lives to complete this mission,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cToday, we honor them,\u201d he added:  As Breitbart News pointed out, Trump openly acknowledged former President Obama following the raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in May 2011, offering personal congratulations after Obama mocked him at the 2011 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner (WHCD) hours prior to the raid: ",

The presidential hopeful\u2019s remark harkens to the ongoing beef Teigen has carried out with the president on Twitter, openly expressing her disdain for the Trump in tweets to her 12 million Twitter followers. Sparks flew in September after Trump tweeted about Legend\u2019s participation in a criminal justice reform town hall on NBC, blasting \u201cboring musician @johnlegend and his filthy mouthed wife\u201d for essentially ignoring his role in getting it done. \u201cGuys like boring musician John Legend and his filthy-mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is \u2014 but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed,\u201d Trump tweeted.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Morning Consult has consistently shown Joe Biden (D) as the frontrunner, despite numerous national polls suggesting otherwise. The\u00a0George Washington University Politics Poll\u00a0released\u00a0ahead of the fourth Democrat debate, for example,\u00a0showed Biden falling to third place nationally, behind both Warren and Sanders. Morning Consult\u2019s latest poll, taken\u00a0October 21-27, 2019, among\u00a015,431 registered voters likely to vote in the Democrat primary or caucus in their state, showed Biden leading the pack with 32 percent. Warren, who has bested Sanders in a number of polls in recent weeks, tied with the Vermont socialist for second place with 20 percent support each. The divide between the top tier of candidates and the remainder of the field has become more drastic, with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) coming in a distant fourth place with just seven percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with six percent support, and Andrew Yang (D) with three percent support. The remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 1 percent:  Sanders also made advances with voters in early primary states, which includes\u00a0Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. While Biden leads with 29 percent support from voters in early primary states, Sanders surpassed Warren with 18 percent support to the Massachusetts senator\u2019s 17 percent support. Once again, Buttigieg came in fourth with eight percent support, followed by Harris and Tom Steyer (D) with seven percent and six percent, respectively. The early primary state results came from\u00a0611 voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. The margin of error was +/- 4 percent. Voters were also asked to choose a second choice candidate. According to the survey, 28 percent of Biden supporters chose Warren, 28 percent of Warren supporters selected Sanders, and 30 percent of Sanders supporters picked Biden. Sanders\u2019 bump in the polls may be\u00a0indicative of the power behind his recent endorsements from far-left members of the \u201cSquad\u201d\u2013 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) \u2013 and notable Hollywood figures, like notorious anti-Trump filmmaker Michael Moore. New Hampshire, the first primary state to vote, is one of the most desirable states for the presidential hopefuls, and a survey conducted by the\u00a0University of New Hampshire indicates that Sanders is back on top. The\u00a0University of New Hampshire Survey Center\u00a0conducted the survey on October 21 \u2013 27, 2019 among 1,266 adults, including \u201c574 likely 2020 Democratic Primary voters and 461 likely 2020 Republican primary voters.\u201d According to the survey, Sanders leads the pack with 21 percent support, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who falls three points behind with 18 percent support. Joe Biden (D) comes in third with 15 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with ten percent support. Andrew Yang (D), Sen Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) followed with five percent support each. The remaining candidates garnered three percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.1 percent:  The results coincide with the Morning Consult poll results released this week, which show Sanders tying with Warren nationally and edging her out in early primary states. The UNHSurveyCenter/CNN poll illustrates a rapidly changing landscape for the top tier of the race. A YouGovUS/CBS News poll released prior to the fourth Democrat debate showed Sanders falling significantly behind in the Granite State, with 17 percent to Warren\u2019s 32 percent and Biden\u2019s 24 percent:  Sanders has\u00a0made a noticeable effort to combat concerns over his age and health in recent days. \u201cI\u2019ve been criticized for being old. I plead guilty. I am old,\u201d Sanders said during a campaign stop in Iowa last week, adding, \u201cBut there are advantages to being old.\u201d Sanders argued that his age proves that the \u201cideas that I am fighting for now didn\u2019t come to me yesterday.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been on more picket lines, I expect, than all my opponents combined over the last 30 years,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHaving a long record gives people the understanding that these ideas that I am talking about \u2014 they are in my guts. They are in my heart,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is who I am as a human being, and it ain\u2019t gonna change.\u201d Moore, who spoke at a Sanders rally in Queens this month, also defended Sanders\u2019 age and health. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a gift that we have a 78-year-old American running for president of the United States,\u201d Moore said, arguing that the Electoral College \u2013 not Sanders \u2013 is \u201ctoo old.\u201d The Fahrenheit 11/9 director also dismissed concerns surrounding Sanders\u2019 health. \u201cHow about we talk about the health of this planet that\u2019s dying. That\u2019s the health I care about,\u201d Moore added.",

      "content": " A poll by Selzer and Company/Grinnell College finds that the vast majority of American adults say they are America First voters, while less than 20 percent identify as socialists. Overall, about seven-in-ten \u2014 or 70 percent \u2014 of likely voters say they are believers in America First \u2014 the nationalist-populist doctrine that guides President Trump\u2019s agenda on immigration, trade, healthcare, and foreign policy, among others. Meanwhile, only about 19 percent of likely voters said they would describe themselves as socialists, making the term the most unliked label for Americans. Instead, more Americans describe themselves as politically incorrect, feminists, gun enthusiasts, proud Americans, and progressives than they do socialists.  The poll details how increasingly, Americans identify as believers in America First. For example, in September, about 66 percent of likely voters said they believed in America First. In about one month, the total of likely voters describing themselves as America First believers jumped four percentage points. A March survey by Harvard/Harris found similar results when U.S. voters were asked their opinions on specific policy questions and whether they side with Trump\u2019s America First doctrine on the issues, Breitbart News reported. In that survey, about three-in-four voters favor the nationalist-populist America First doctrine on issues like immigration, trade, and foreign policy.\u00a0The findings were the latest evidence that the open borders, globalization, and endless wars ideology of former administrations \u2014 such as President George W. Bush\u2019s \u2014 have little-to-no support with American voters. The poll was conducted between October 17 to October 23 and included more than 1,000 U.S. adults over the age of 18-years-old \u2014 806 of which are likely voters.

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " In an op-ed for the Detroit News, United Auto Worker (UAW) member and Ford employee Melinda Rowe called out 2020 Democrats for their \u201czero-carbon\u201d agenda that will further decimate the United States\u2019 auto industry in states like Ohio and Michigan. The Green New Deal agenda of Democrat presidential candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Rowe writes, would mean more profits for multinational automaker CEOs and fewer jobs for American auto workers: GM and the other big auto companies want to make a full switch to electric vehicles, which would allow them to slash union jobs. As any autoworker can tell you, combustion engines are difficult to build, requiring more manpower and skill than electric motors. That\u2019s why auto workers earn such good wages: It\u2019s not easy to engineer a controlled explosion under the hood of a car. [Emphasis added] \u2026 When Democrats claim to support organized labor but also advance a radical environmental agenda that would destroy union jobs, they make it abundantly obvious that their support for union workers is merely rhetorical. [Emphasis added] Trump is the only person defending the interests of union members against the combined forces of Democratic politicians, car company executives, and UAW leaders who care only about advancing their own interests over those of the hard working men and women of their industry. [Emphasis added] Rowe detailed how executives at U.S. automakers have fallen in line with the Democrat agenda of eliminating fossil fuels, noting that such a move to fully electric vehicles will allow corporations to cut back their workforces more than they already have, saving them labor costs at the expense of U.S. communities. \u201cWe saw a clear example of this in the UAW-GM negotiations, when GM proposed building a car battery factory near the plant that it recently closed in Lordstown, Ohio,\u201d Rowe writes. \u201cThe battery plant would likely employ several hundred workers, whereas the Lordstown factory supported more than 3,000 union jobs. The battery plant will also only pay workers between $15 and $17 per hour, about half the $30 per hour that workers earned at the Lordstown factory.\u201d  Rowe writes that it was \u201cno coincidence\u201d that General Motors (GM) has closed five American manufacturing plants and laid off 14,000 workers as they manufacture electric vehicles in China. Warren, among other 2020 Democrats, has also pledged a nationwide ban on fracking which would likely increase oil prices and potentially lead to additional layoffs for American auto workers. American manufacturing is vital to the U.S. economy as every one manufacturing job\u00a0supports\u00a0an additional 7.4 American jobs in other industries. Decades of free trade, with deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), have eliminated five million\u00a0manufacturing jobs from the U.S. economy and resulted in the closure of 50,000 manufacturing plants.

The left presents suppressors as devices that silence gunshots, yet in reality suppressors simply reduce the sharp, ear-splitting sound wave accompanies the sound of a bullet being fired. The sound of the gunshot is very much audible, even with a suppressor attached. Pertinent to the Virginia Beach shooting was the fact it occurred in a part of the building that was mandated gun-free for city employees. This means the gunman had every advantage, with or without a suppressor, inasmuch as his victims could not shoot back. The Crime Prevention Research Center\u00a0examined\u00a0mass public shootings for the time period of 1950 to May 2018 and found that 97.8 percent of them occurred in gun-free zones. Yet Warren\u2019s to-do list for ending gun violence says nothing about abolishing gun-free zones so Americans can exercise their Second Amendment right to self-defense.

      "content": " Medicare for All is straight-up socialism. It\u2019s stripping 150 million Americans of the health insurance they are satisfied with to force us into a one-size-fits-all, government-run system. Remember how well that worked out for the Veterans Administration? How many people died? Then there\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d college on top of forgiving a trillion dollars in student loan debt that is owed to us, the hard-working taxpayers of America. Don\u2019t forget a guaranteed income, whether you work hard or stay home all day smoking a bowl in front of the Cartoon Network. Do you want to know just how good life is in this country? We are worried about an epidemic of obesity among the \u201cpoor,\u201d and just this week we learned that the children of the \u201cpoor\u201d \u00a0spend more time in front of an electric screen than the non-poor. In other words, poor people have too much food and munch on all that food while enjoying their iPads and iPhones and hand-held video games. In other words, they are not really poor. Other than the mentally ill and those dealing with addiction, people that cannot be helped without violating their civil right to live on the street, America has done it \u2014 we have licked poverty. Oh, sure, we can use slide-rules and charts and graphs, we can pull a number out of our backside to designate a certain group of people as \u201cpoor,\u201d but while we are doing that the poor are enjoying a standard of living the rich only dreamt of a hundred years ago \u2014 central heat, television, air conditioning, an abundance of food, games, Internet access, a cell phone\u2026 are you kidding me? And now, because 19 percent of the population \u2014 most of them almost assuredly young and dumb, immature and unwise, inexperienced and ignorant \u2014 think they want socialism, the 2020 field is prepared to \u201cfix\u201d a market economy that is working miraculously well, because fairness or something\u2026 And here\u2019s the thing, most of those 19 percent\u2026 They are going to grow out of it. As they gain experience, maturity, and wisdom, they will wake up to certain realities of life and reject socialism, because only a lunatic can look at the history of socialism and want to live that way. Before he assassinated President Kennedy, even dedicated Marxist Lee Harvey Oswald got his wish to live in the Soviet Union\u2026 \u00a0and then spent most of his time there trying to return, not just to the United States, but to Texas! Remember the Woodstock Generation? A majority of them are Republicans now. That\u2019s just how it works, how it has always worked\u2026 But what has changed, what has moved Democrats into a socialist posture that would shock even Barack Obama, is that the establishment media is now infested with radical leftists who all speak as one. On top of that, America\u2019s young and dumb enjoy a presence on social media that over-exaggerates their influence and twists reality (if you\u2019re dumb enough to believe social media is reality) into something it is not. The horror show, then, would be a Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren sliding into power, and that would be a horror show even for those 19 percent, because in a few years they are growing to become a little wiser as they struggle and die in the awful world they wished for.

      "subtitle": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said she has been \u201cmostly\u201d flying commercial in an effort to combat climate change but said her campaign is trying to look at \u201cother ways\u201d to reduce its carbon footprint.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " In an appearance on New Hampshire Public Radio Wednesday morning, Warren discussed some of the ways her campaign is hoping to reduce its carbon footprint. She admitted she still embraces air travel but claimed she \u201cmostly\u201d flies commercial. \u201cWhat specific steps have you taken in your campaign to ensure that your campaign\u2019s environmental impact is limited as possible?\u201d a listener asked. Host\u00a0Laura Knoy pointed out that Tom Steyer (D) recently told NHPR\u00a0that he is only flying commercial, adding, \u201cthere\u2019s a huge carbon footprint of a private jet, so that\u2019s the sacrifice he said he was willing to make. How about you?\u201d \u201cSo I\u2019ve mostly been flying commercial,\u201d Warren said, explaining that her campaign has been trying to look at \u201cother ways\u201d to reduce its carbon footprint. \u201cIt\u2019s everything from the kind of car we drive and down to, do we purchase offsets? Can we make that work s a way to try to reduce the footprint,\u201d she said, failing to elaborate if her campaign\u2019s proposals have come to fruition. \u201cOne of the things that has been so interesting to me in the whole area of climate has been the good ideas that have come from lots of different campaigns. One I just want to get a pitch in here for is when Gov. Inslee was running,\u201d she said: He talked about the importance of regulating three industries\u2013 that by 2028 no new buildings, no new houses that have any carbon footprints\u2013 zero carbon footprint on new buildings. By 2030, all newly built cars and trucks\u2013\u00a0zero carbon footprint. And by 2035, all electric production\u2013 zero carbon footprint. \u201cWe do those three things, we cut carbon emission in our country by 70 percent. Think about that, three things, 70 percent reduction,\u201d she said. Warren\u2019s admission, that she \u201cmostly\u201d flies commercial, follows reports of several climate-concerned 2020 candidates spending tens of thousands of dollars on private air travel throughout the course of their campaigns. As Breitbart News reported: Joe Biden (D) has been under fire in recent days after it was reported that his campaign\u00a0dropped\u00a0short of $1 million \u2013\u00a0\u00a0$924,000\u00a0 \u2013 on private jet usage in the third quarter (July 1 \u2013 September 30) alone. The expenses were attributed to the EJCR, LLC Dba Advanced Aviation Team, recent Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show. While Biden leads the pack, he is not alone in his\u00a0exorbitant private air travel expenditures. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reportedly\u00a0spent\u00a0just short of $500,000 \u2013 $479,000 \u2013\u00a0 on private air travel. That is a $179,000 increase from his private air travel expenses in the previous quarter, according to the\u00a0Hill. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also put her climate change-related concerns aside, spending $253,000\u2013 $236,000 more than the $17,000 she spent in the previous three months. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \u2013 who once\u00a0described\u00a0climate change as\u00a0the \u201cgreatest threat\u00a0to our national security\u201d \u2013 spent $360,000 on private air travel in the third quarter. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) \u2013 who described climate change as an \u201cexistential crisis that threatens all of us\u201d \u2013 also utilized private air travel, spending $132,000 in the third quarter. However, a campaign aide told the\u00a0Hill\u00a0that Warren makes an effort to offset her carbon output and gave $10,150 to Native Energy in the third quarter. The outline of the Green New Deal, which Warren emphatically supports, actively objects to air travel but notes that it would be virtually impossible to eliminate completely. It stated: We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.",

      "content": " (Watch: 17:34\u201419:04) A partial transcript is as follows: CASEY MCDERMOTT:\u00a0Regardless of what kind of money is involved, Medicare for All would likely result in a pretty significant shift in how our healthcare system is structured. And even supporters of that approach within the health policy world have said that that likely would mean lost jobs in some form. An economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst told Kaiser Health News earlier this year that that could result in about 2 million jobs lost. He said this would be mostly administrative positions and insurers, doctors\u2019 offices, and he said that politicians who want to move toward that system, Medicare for All, have to think about what \u201cjust transition,\u201d a fair transition would look like. What would that look like for you? SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN:\u00a0So, I agree. I think this is part of the cost issue and should be part of the cost plan. Although, do recognize on this what we are talking about and that is, in effect, how much of our healthcare dollars have not gone to healthcare. How many of those dollars have been pulled out in other directions? Think about the for-profit insurance system we have that lays at the very middle of our healthcare delivery system. That system made $23 billion in profits last year and that\u2019s after all the executive salaries, all the administrative people, all the fancy glass office buildings they built, and how do they make those profits? Think about it. It\u2019s how much they took in for premiums and then turned around and said \u201cno,\u201d and every time they said \u201cno,\u201d they made another dollar of profits.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " While Democrat voters tend to believe that Biden stands the greatest chance of defeating Trump in a general election matchup, his once-secure lead is slipping. Morning Consult/Politico surveyed\u00a01,997 registered voters on a hypothetical Biden-Trump matchup, and while it showed Biden besting Trump by five percentage points, that is a six-point drop from the 11 point lead he held over the president in June. According to the survey, taken October 25-28, Biden would defeat Trump 41 percent to Trump\u2019s 36 percent. However, June\u2019s survey showed the former vice president with an 11 point lead, 44 percent to Trump\u2019s 33 percent. Trump is also gaining on Sanders. In June, Sanders led Trump 42 percent to 32 percent. October\u2019s survey, however, showed Trump two points behind Sanders. The survey also showed Trump overtaking Warren in a hypothetical 2020 matchup, 36 percent to 35 percent. The margin of error is +/- two percent.  As Morning Consult indicates, Trump\u2019s gains come from two demographics he has traditionally struggled with, women and young voters: While Trump cut into Biden\u2019s edge with several demographic groups between the two surveys, some of the president\u2019s biggest gains came among women and the youngest voters, two groups that are typically seen as some of his weakest voting blocs. Trump trails Biden by 11 points among women in the latest poll, conducted Oct. 25-28, compared with a 20-point gap in June. And while he still lags 14 points behind Biden among voters ages 18 to 29, that\u2019s a significant improvement on the 28-point deficit he faced in June. Independents are also falling in line with the incumbent: Biden\u2019s 1-point lead among those voters is down from an 11-point edge in June. While Democrat voters have tended to flock to Biden due to his perceived electability, which may be changing. \u201cForty percent of Democratic primary voters said\u00a0in September\u00a0that they thought Biden has the best chance of beating Trump in 2020, more than twice the share who said the same of any other candidate,\u201d Morning Consult noted. \u201cTo that extent, declining returns in head-to-head matchups against Trump may pose a unique risk to his prospects for securing the nomination,\u201d it added.",

      "subtitle": "Former Vice President Joe Biden has expanded his lead over rival 2020 Democrats in Pennsylvania, a state he claims to be his home turf.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " A poll\u00a0released\u00a0by Franklin & Marshall College on Thursday shows the former vice president leading his nearest rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), by double digits. Biden, known to refer to himself as \u201cJoe from Scranton\u201d\u00a0on the campaign\u00a0trail, commands 30 percent of registered Democrats, according to the results. Warren, who has leapfrogged the former vice president in national and early state polls, captured second place with 18 percent. Rounding out the top four were Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 12 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The results paint a different picture than the last Franklin & Marshall poll from August, which saw Biden only leading Warren within the margin of error. In that survey, the former vice president only posted 28 percent among Democrats to Warren\u2019s 21 percent. Biden\u2019s improvement between August and October comes from the inroads his campaign seems to have made with those that identify as liberal Democrats.\u00a0In August, the former vice president garnered only 13 percent among such voters, trailing both Warren (31 percent) and Sanders (16 percent). This time around, however, Biden bested Sanders for second place among liberal Democrats, taking 24 percent to the self-described democrat socialist\u2019s 15 percent. Warren still remained the favorite at 31 percent, but did not gain any support even as Sanders, a darling of the progressive left, lost ground. The former vice president\u2019s rise among liberal Democrats, though, has come at the price of his support with self-acknowledged moderates. In August, Biden dominated among such voters, commanding 47 percent outright, leading Biden and Sanders by as much as forty percentage points. Thursday\u2019s poll found Biden taking 40 percent among moderates, with Sanders in second place with nine percent. Warren and Buttigieg landed in third and fourth place respectively, garnering eight percent and seven percent each. The poll also found an educational divide between\u00a0Pennsylvania Democrats that seems to fit into the broader argument Biden has been making since entering the race. Among respondents with a high school degree or less, the former vice president led his challengers resoundingly. Biden captured 39 percent among such voters, compared to ten percent for Warren and six percent for Sanders. He similarly led with Democrats that had some college education, taking 29 percent to Sanders\u2019 13 percent and Warren\u2019s seven percent. It was only among college educated Democrats that Warren led Biden narrowly, 28 percent to 26 percent. Sanders landed in third place with such voters at 14 percent. Biden\u2019s strong showing in Pennsylvania, especially among working class voters, buoys his campaign as it faces fundraising troubles and sinking poll numbers. The poll also seems to give credence to Biden\u2019s argument that he\u2019s the only Democrat capable of winning back the white working class, who although decreasingly nationally still make up a significant portion of the electorate in states like Pennsylvania. In 2016, voters without a college degree\u00a0backed\u00a0President Donald Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by a margin of 52 percent to 44 percent. The share was significantly larger among non-college educated whites, who broke for Trump by the largest margin since 1980\u201467 percent to 28 percent. Trump\u2019s margin among the group was vital in carrying Pennsylvania and other parts of the industrial United States that had voted Democrat for decades prior to 2016. Biden\u2019s showing in the Franking & Marshall is also likely a personal boost, especially as the former vice president often touts his Pennsylvania roots.\u00a0Not only was Biden born in Scranton, Pennsylvania but he lived there with his family until the age of 11, when they moved to neighboring Delaware. Although Biden remained in Delaware for the rest of his life and built a successful political career, Pennsylvania, by his own admission, held a special place in his heart. During his nearly 40-year congressional career, Biden\u2019s advocacy on behalf of the state and it\u2019s interests earned him the nickname the \u201cthird senator from Pennsylvania.\u201d \u201cFor the last thirty-five years, any time Scranton needs something\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to say no to them,\u201d Biden\u00a0told\u00a0GQ\u00a0magazine in 2010. \u201cFor real. I really don\u2019t. You know, it\u2019s still home\u201d Since announcing his campaign, Biden\u00a0frequently invoked Pennsylvania and his upbringing in Scranton, specifically, to legitimize his middle-class bonafides. Biden\u2019s proclivity for such statements has even drawn derision from Trump, who hopes to carry the state again in 2020. \u201cHe\u2019s not from Pennsylvania,\u201d the president\u00a0said\u00a0during a May campaign swing through the state. \u201cI guess he was born here, but he left you folks. \u2026 He left you for another state, and he didn\u2019t take care of you, because he didn\u2019t take care of your jobs. He let other countries come in and rip off America.\u201d",

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) unveiled her highly anticipated Medicare for All plan on Friday, claiming she will pay for the multitrillion-dollar proposal by repurposing existing costs, increasing taxes on the wealthy, cutting defense spending, and providing a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Political commentators, town hall attendees, and reporters have asked the presidential hopeful, repeatedly, how she would pay for Medicare for All. While Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has openly admitted that the program would cause middle class taxes to increase, Warren has refused to say such, instead pivoting to overall \u201ccost.\u201d \u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy and for corporations, and for the middle-class families, they will go down,\u201d Warren said during the last debate. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families,\u201d she added. Warren officially unveiled her Medicare for All proposal on Friday, declaring that it will not \u201craise taxes one penny on the middle-class\u201d:  Warren\u2019s plan, she estimates, would cost \u201cjust under $52 trillion\u201d over the next decade, requiring $20.5 trillion in new spending. She claims that her plan will actually result in savings for middle class Americans \u2013 $11 trillion \u2013 by erasing out-of-pocket expenses. Meanwhile, \u201ctargeted spending cuts\u201d and \u201cnew taxes on giant corporations and the richest 1% of Americans\u201d will fund the program, she claims. One of the aspects of her plan requires companies to make payments to the federal government in the form of an \u201cEmployer Medicare Contribution.\u201d She argues this would replace what they currently contribute to private insurance companies. Companies with 50 employees or fewer would be exempt. As the Washington Post explains: Central to making Warren\u2019s math work is re-purposing the approximately $9 trillion private employers are already projected to spend on health care over the next decade. Warren\u2019s plan calls for effectively locking these payment levels in place under the Medicare-for-all program, also called a single-payer system, by taxing firms at about the same rate that they currently spend on private insurance. Warren\u2019s plan states: If we\u2019re falling short of the $8.8 trillion revenue target for the next ten years, we will make up lost revenue with a Supplemental Employer Medicare Contribution requirement for big companies with extremely high executive compensation and stock buyback rates. Warren also proposes to \u201cinstitute a country-by-country minimum tax on foreign earnings of 35% \u2013 equal to a restored top corporate tax rate for U.S. firms \u2013 without permitting corporations to defer those payments.\u201d Additionally, she takes her \u201cUltra-Millionaire Tax\u201d further, \u201casking billionaires to pitch in six cents on each dollar of net worth above $1 billion\u201d instead of three cents. Warren also proposes a reduction in defense spending and amnesty for illegal aliens as two key sources of revenue to fund her multitrillion-dollar proposal: I\u2019ve also called to reduce defense spending overall. The Pentagon budget will cost more this year than everything else in the discretionary budget put together. That\u2019s wrong, and it\u2019s unsustainable.

No other candidate comes close to the top cluster. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) comes in 13 points behind Biden with four percent support, and Sen.

Even the Times describes the poll\u2019s findings as\u00a0\u201cfull of alarming signs\u201d for the former vice president, noting his lackluster performance in early primary and caucus states and adding his \u201ccomparatively\u00a0weak\u00a0position \u2026 presents a serious threat to his candidacy.\u201d The results coincide with a\u00a0Civiqs survey\u00a0released\u00a0last week, which also showed Biden dropping to fourth place in the Hawkeye State. The Civiqs survey, taken October 18-22, 2019, among 598 likely Democratic Caucus attendees,\u00a0 showed Warren with 28 percent support, followed by Buttigieg, Sanders, and Biden with 20 percent, 18 percent, and 12 percent, respectively:  The candidates are expected to attend the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s Liberty and Justice Fundraiser Friday evening, giving the presidential hopefuls a platform to pitch their ideas and garner enthusiasm before February 3, 2020.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " On Friday, Warren\u00a0unveiled her highly anticipated plan for Medicare for All, providing details on how she would pay for the $52 trillion proposal, which would require roughly $20.5 trillion in new spending over the next decade. She proclaimed that her plan would not require a middle class tax hike, proposing to pay for the multitrillion-dollar program by increasing her \u201cUltra-Millionaire Tax,\u201d\u00a0 slashing defense spending, providing a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and\u00a0repurposing existing costs. The latter, for example, would require companies with more than 50 employees to make payments to the government in the form of an \u201cEmployer Medicare Contribution,\u201d which she argues would replace the existing payments they make to healthcare providers. However, some of her 2020 rivals are already taking issue with her lofty proposal. Bennet released a statement asserting that her plan is \u201csimply not believable.\u201d \u201cVoters are sick and tired of politicians promising them things that they know they can\u2019t deliver,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWarren\u2019s new numbers are simply not believable and have been contradicted by experts.\u201d \u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s $21 trillion or $31 trillion, this isn\u2019t going to happen, and the American people need health care,\u201d he added. Biden, through his deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, also blasted the Massachusetts senator\u2019s plan. \u201cFor months, Elizabeth Warren has refused to say if her health care plan would raise taxes on the middle class, and now we know why: because it does,\u201d Bedingfield said, according to the Hill. \u201cSenator Warren would place a new tax of nearly $9 trillion that will fall on American workers,\u201d she continued: There\u2019s no two ways about it, we cannot defeat\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0with double talk on health care \u2014 especially not about the impact and cost of a proposal to completely dismantle our health care system and eliminate employer-sponsored and all other private health insurance. Biden has emphasized\u00a0building on Obamacare and even promoted it in a tweet on Friday:  John Delaney (D), who has remained a consistent critic of Warren\u2019s lofty proposals and \u201cfairy tale economics,\u201d also took aim at Warren\u2019s proposal. \u201cI was the first person to point out the flaws of Medicare4all and I\u2019m the only one with a real universal healthcare plan that works. @ewarren\u00a0numbers don\u2019t add up and the \u2018public options\u2019 Dems don\u2019t go far enough,\u201d Delaney wrote. \u201cBetterCare is the only sensible universal healthcare plan.\u201d \u201cA \u2018public option\u2019 is a government run insurance company that does not go nearly far enough in addressing the inequality in our healthcare system,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe need universal healthcare; most developed nations have universal healthcare,\u201d he added. \u201cBut Medicare4all is a bad plan, BetterCare works\u201d:   Seemingly anticipating the backlash, Warren challenged her competitors to lay out the \u201ctrue, full costs\u201d of their healthcare proposals following her plan\u2019s release Friday morning. \u201cI am fighting for #MedicareForAll,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI have the only detailed plan to pay for it.\u201d \u201cAnd we are the only Democratic primary campaign that has laid out the true, full costs of any health care plan, Medicare for All or otherwise,\u201d she continued. \u201cI look forward to others doing the same\u201d: ",

The $52 trillion plan will be partially paid for, Warren says, by driving up the population to the highest levels possible to increase federal tax revenue. Warren\u2019s plan would hinge on providing amnesty for all illegal aliens and increasing legal immigration levels, which already sit at historic highs with more than 1.5 million foreign nationals added to the U.S. population every year. \u201cI support immigration reform that\u2019s consistent with our values, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and expanded legal immigration consistent with my principles,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s not only the right thing to do \u2013 it also increases federal revenue we can dedicate to Medicare for All as new people come into the system and pay taxes.\u201d Warren\u2019s donor class immigration plan, as Breitbart News has reported, is supported by tech billionaires, the open borders lobby, the outsourcing industry, the Chamber of Commerce, as well as the nation\u2019s giant multinational corporations that have sought for decades to drive down U.S. wages by importing cheaper foreign workers to compete against America\u2019s working and middle class. Already, at current legal immigration levels, the U.S. is set to increase its population to 404 million residents by 2060 \u2014 the largest population in American history. This indicates that by 2060, about one-in-six U.S. residents will have been born in a foreign country. In 1970, one-in-twenty U.S. residents were foreign-born. At current legal immigration levels, nearly 580,000 foreign-born residents will be added to the population every year, while just 1.3 million native-born residents are set to be added every year. A moratorium on immigration would stabilize the nation\u2019s population at about 250 million residents. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at\u00a0@JxhnBinder.",

      "author": "Sean Moran",
      "content": " Warren faced criticism during the last Democrat presidential debate when she dodged questions over how she would pay for her single-payer Medicare for All plan. The Massachusetts Democrat unveiled her plan Thursday, in which she claimed that her plan would not foot the bill onto the middle class. \u201cToday, I\u2019m releasing my plan to pay for #MedicareForAll. Here\u2019s the headline: My plan won\u2019t raise taxes one penny on middle-class families,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019ll return about $11 TRILLION to the American people. That\u2019s bigger than the biggest tax cut in our history.\u201d  Warren contrasts with fellow 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who has admitted that the middle class will pay more in taxes; however, he claims that it will pay less in premiums and other healthcare costs. Warren estimated that her plan would cost $52 trillion over the next years, which would require $20.5 trillion in new spending. To offset the cost of her plan, Warren proposed an \u201cEmployer Medicare Contribution,\u201d which replaces what companies pay to insurance companies and sends it to the federal government. In a similar manner with Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate, businesses with fewer than 50 employees would be exempt from the Employer Medicare Contribution. The Employer Medicare Contribution essentially amounts to an employer-side payroll tax, which many economists say harms workers in the form of suppressed wages. The Tax Policy Center noted that the\u00a0\u201cemployee bears the burden of both the employer and employee portions of payroll taxes.\u201d  Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, Kate Beddingfield, has contended that \u201cit\u2019s impossible to pay for Medicare for All without middle-class tax increases.\u201d Beddingfield said that the plan \u201cwould place a new tax of nearly $9 trillion that will fall on American workers.\u201d As\u00a0Washington Examiner editor Phillip Klein noted, even if Americans would save money on premiums and administrative costs through her Medicare for All plan, the Medicare Contribution would \u201cstill count as a tax increase.\u201d An Emory University healthcare expert told the\u00a0Washington Post that \u201cthere\u2019s no question\u201d that Medicare for All \u201chits the middle class.\u201d The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget contended that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to finance Medicare for All only through taxes on the wealthy. Further, in Warren\u2019s plan, she proposes to fund Medicare for All through a financial transactions tax, which would likely target the country\u2019s wealthiest. Although, some experts suggest that the tax could still soak the middle class. Another Democrat presidential candidate \u2014 South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014 told Fox News this week that Warren\u2019s plan\u00a0\u201cis not just the multi-trillion-dollar hole, but also the fact that most Americans would prefer not to be told that they have to abandon their private plan.\u201d Trump campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh blasted Warren\u2019s plan as a \u201ctotal disaster.\u201d \u201cThere are 52 trillion reasons why this plan is a total disaster,\u201d Murtaugh said. \u201cBest of luck to the fact checkers who now have to clean up the mess.\u201d However, despite her claims, Warren promised this week that she would \u201cnot sign any legislation into law for which costs for middle-class families do not go down.\u201d Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

      "author": "Michael Patrick Leahy",
      "content": " It was a warmup for the evening\u2019s Democrat Party Liberty and Justice Celebration and fundraiser at the Wells Fargo Arena, where thousands of rank-and-file Democrats are expected to listen to 14 of the candidates vying for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination explain why Iowa Caucus attendees should back them. Breitbart News spoke with two of the Buttigieg volunteers, one from Santa Barbara and another from San Diego, who said they were part of 150 volunteers who paid their own way to come to Iowa to support the Buttigieg campaign. One volunteer said that a total of 1,200 Buttigieg volunteers from around the country flew to Des Moines to lend their support to Buttigieg. \u201cI\u2019m strictly a volunteer. I absolutely paid for my travel here myself,\u201d Laurie from Santa Barbara told Breitbart News. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be at least 150 to 200 people from California for Pete tonight,\u201d she added. Laurie had a succinct explanation for why she made the trip to Des Moines. \u201cThis is a big deal for the Democratic Party to be participating in this event. As we all know, this is the event tonight that turned around the polls and the momentum for Barack Obama. And we see the same thing happening for Pete,\u201d she said. Laurie was also optimistic about Buttigieg\u2019s chances of winning the Iowa Caucuses outright, saying, \u201cIf you look at the polls released this morning from CNN it basically shows a four-way tie for first place.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re here as part of the barnstorming effort for Pete. It\u2019s a group of volunteers who feel so inspired by Pete running for president that we paid our own way to fly to Iowa to meet with the folks here and get visibility for Pete and explain our personal stories as to why we feel Pete is the most qualified person to be president,\u201d George, who said he is a deputy city clerk from San Diego, told Breitbart News. \u201cI feel like Pete speaks to the division in the country, and why we need to have a candidate to bring everyone together. He speaks about the day after the election how divided the country will be, regardless of who the next president is, and how important it will be to everyone in the country to feel that the person that\u2019s been elected speaks to them. So he\u2019s staking out a ground that speaks to, not either side, but to both sides of the country,\u201d George added. When pressed by Breitbart News to explain how Buttigieg\u2019s support for the ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Trump by Democrats in the House of Representatives\u2014which many Republicans have characterized as a grossly unfair and un-American partisan witch hunt\u2014would unite the country, George was unable to provide a compelling response. \u201cEach of these individual candidates has a position as to whether the president has committed a high crime or misdemeanor. That\u2019s the position they\u2019re taking. I feel that, for a lot of folks, an inquisition, or an inquiry is important for everybody to look into,\u201d George said Breitbart News spoke with two Buttigieg volunteers from Indiana at another venue in Des Moines on Friday morning who confirmed that volunteers have flown in to Des Moines from around the country at their own expense, but could not confirm the number of such volunteers. As many as 200,000 Iowa Democrats are expected to gather across the state on February 3 for a first-in-the-nation electoral contest to determine the party\u2019s presidential nominee for the November 2020 general election. Blue and yellow \u201cPete 2020\u201d campaign signs are widely visible in downtown Des Moines, a clear indication that the presidential campaign of the 37-year-old two-term mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is well organized on the ground in advance of the evening\u2019s event. Other campaigns, including those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former Vice President Joe Biden (D), and Andrew Yang (D), also had street signage visible in Des Moines on Friday, but most of that was within a thousand feet of the Wells Fargo Arena. In advance of the evening, all the major presidential campaigns hosted meet and greet events near the Wells Fargo Arena on Friday afternoon in hopes of creating volunteer enthusiasm and support for their candidate at the evening\u2019s event. The Buttigieg campaign is clearly hoping that the candidate\u2019s speech this evening\u2013where each candidate is limited to a ten minute address\u2013will give him the same kind of boost that Obama received when he addressed the same event 11 years earlier in 2007.",

Obama.\u201d  Schultz made the comments even though his side had technically started the altercation by criticizing Warren\u2019s newly released proposal on how to pay for Medicare for All, arguing it was regressive. The Biden campaign said in a statement on Friday upon the plan\u2019s announcement: For months, Elizabeth Warren has refused to say if her health care plan would raise taxes on the middle class, and now we know why: because it does. Senator Warren would place a new tax of nearly $9 trillion that will fall on American workers. The flare-up between the two camps underscores the precarious position Biden finds himself in three months away from the first nominating contest in Iowa. Although the former vice president started the race as the clear frontrunner, leading the field by as much as\u00a032 percentage points\u00a0at one point, his campaign has steadily declined in recent months. As the former vice president\u2019s political fortunes have diminished, Warren\u2019s have only increased. The Massachusetts Democrat has leapfrogged Biden in the early primary and caucus states. One recent poll out of Iowa showed Warren leading the field with 28 percent support among Democrats, while Biden was relegated to fourth place with only 12 percent. A similar situation has played out nationally, where most polls show Warren leading Biden, albeit with a narrow margin.  Warren\u2019s rise in the polls has even led some of Biden\u2019s former Obama administration colleagues, such as David Axelrod, to\u00a0acknowledge\u00a0he is no longer the frontrunner.",

      "author": "Michael Patrick Leahy",
      "content": " Earlier in the day, a fourteenth candidate who had been scheduled to speak, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX), withdrew from the race. Democrat National Committee Chairman Tom Perez set the tone for the evening when he told the audience Donald Trump was \u201cthe worst president in the history of our country.\u201d Perez attacked members of Iowa\u2019s Republican Congressional delegation as well. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) \u201cis a Trump puppet, plain and simple,\u201d he said, and Rep. Steve King (R-IA) \u201cis an utter disgrace not only in Iowa but in the country.\u201d Comparing Rep. King to one of the characters created by the horror novelist Steven King,\u00a0 Perez said, \u201cSteve King is that evil clown.\u201d The most recent poll of likely Iowa Caucus attendees shows a top tier of four candidates: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA); Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT); South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and former Vice President Joe Biden. Two themes dominated the candidates\u2019 speeches: a promise to take the fight to President Trump and a promise to unify the country after that fight is won. Notably, among the top tier candidates, only Sanders mentioned the word \u201cimpeachment\u201d in his speech. Buttigieg, who has been moving up in the polls and appears to have the best on-the-ground organizational infrastructure in the state, was the first of the 13 candidates to address the crowd. As Breitbart News reported on Friday, an estimated 1,200 Buttigieg volunteers from around the country, including 150 from California, flew into Des Moines to attend Friday night\u2019s event. In advance of Buttigieg\u2019s speech, his campaign had attempted to create the expectation he would replicate the \u201cObama moment\u201d of the 2008 campaign when then-candidate Barack Obama, addressing the crowd at the same event (then called the Jefferson Jackson Day Dinner, now called the Liberty and Justice Celebration) in November 2007, shifted the entire momentum of the primary campaign from front runner Hillary Clinton to the relatively little-known junior senator from Illinois. But there was to be no \u201cObama moment\u201d for Buttigieg in Des Moines on Friday night. While his speech was politely received by the entire audience, the loud applause and wild demonstrations that constantly interrupted his talk came from one narrow section of the arena\u2013the part reserved for a large contingent of about 1,500 Buttigieg supporters wearing yellow t-shirts and waving rally batons. \u201cThe first time I came to this state was as a volunteer who knocked on doors for a presidential candidate, a young man with a funny name. We knew the stakes were high then. The stakes are colossal now,\u201d Buttigieg began. \u201cThis country cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump. We will not recognize it if he is re-elected. We know what is at stake. And we know he will do everything he can to hold on to power. But if you nominate me, his playbook isn\u2019t going to work this time around,\u201d he continued. Buttigieg was followed by former Vice President Joe Biden, who promised repeatedly that if he is the Democrat nominee, he will \u201cbeat Trump like a drum\u201d in the general election. Sen. Warren noted that the country needed \u201cbig structural change\u201d due to the abuses of wealth and power visited upon the middle class by the rich and that she is uniquely qualified to deliver that structural change by offering Medicare for All and her two percent wealth tax. \u201cI\u2019m here to talk about something that people all across Iowa and people all across the country know in their bones. Our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and the powerful,\u201d Warren began. \u201cThey make it work for themselves, and they leave everyone else behind. We see it every time a corporate executive threatens to cut pay and move jobs overseas. We see every time an insurance company won\u2019t give people, denies treatment and denies people access to the doctors they know and trust. We see it when a criminal justice system tears apart black and brown families,\u201d she continued. Sen.\u00a0 Sanders began his speech by noting that \u201ctonight, no matter what candidate we are supporting, all of us are in agreement that we must defeat the most dangerous president in the history of our country,\u201d echoing the theme sounded by DNC Chair Tom Perez at the beginning of the evening. \u201cThe man is a pathological liar, a man who is running the most corrupt administration in the history of our country, a man who does not understand the rule of law, or our country\u2019s history, and a man who will soon be impeached. That is what we all agree on,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut let us acknowledge that we have some disagreements,\u201d he continued. \u201cDo we continue the status quo politics that has enabled the wealthiest people in our country, the largest corporations in their markets, to have extraordinary influence over the economic and political life of our country?\u201d Sanders asked. Andrew Yang was the only candidate who chose not to focus on what a terrible president Donald Trump is but instead on the underlying economic reasons for his election victory in 2016\u2013the loss of retail and manufacturing jobs around the country and the rise of the power of technology companies. Yang in particular focused on Amazon, which, he said, had over $20 billion in revenue but paid no taxes, while retail clerk jobs were disappearing around the country. Yang\u2019s solution was to tax the technology companies and use those proceeds to pay each American $1,000 a month, an idea, he said, that was not new. He claimed it was a proposal passed by Congress in 1971. [Note on crowd size: The seating capacity of the Wells Fargo Arena is 15,000 for hockey games and 16,000 for basketball games. The arena appeared to be about 3/4 filled at the beginning of the event, hence the estimate that the crowd size was about 12,000 in the stadium seats and about another 1,000 were seated at dinner tables on the floor of the arena.]",

Warren actually goes a step further, proclaiming that her plan could save families thousands per year, which she \u201cproves\u201d via a \u201cMedicare for All Calculator\u201d\u00a0designed to assist individuals and families to \u201cfind out what Elizabeth\u2019s plan for Medicare for All will mean for you.\u201d However, the calculator largely issues the same canned response no matter how the user answers the questions. The calculator asks, \u201cWhere do you get your health care right now?\u201d and provides six options. Those are as follows: Four of the options \u2013 Medicaid, Medicare, VA/TRICARE, and\u00a0I Don\u2019t Have Health Care Right Now \u2013 do not require further information. Medicaid and Medicare\u2019s answer states, \u201cYou\u2019re already covered, and under Elizabeth\u2019s Medicare for All plan, you\u2019d get even better coverage at almost no cost to you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re already covered under VA/TRICARE, but you\u2019d also have the option of enrolling in Medicare for All,\u201d users who select VA/TRICARE are told. Those who indicate that they do not already possess coverage are told that they will get \u201cpractically free health care for you and anyone else who needs it.\u201d The two remaining options require more information, asking the user \u201cRoughly, how much do you spend each year on health care?\u201d It appears, no matter the cost the user puts in, the calculator proclaims that the amount provided is the exact amount the user will save under her Medicare for All plan, displaying, \u201cMORE MONEY IN YOUR POCKET\u201d in all caps. For example, if the user indicates they spend roughly $7,038 per year on health care, Warren\u2019s calculator claims that \u201cyou\u2019d bring home an estimated\u00a0$7,038 more per year under Elizabeth\u2019s Medicare for All plan.\u201d If the user puts in a figure $999 or less, it simply states, \u201cYou\u2019d bring home more money per year under Elizabeth\u2019s Medicare for All plan.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s because you won\u2019t have to pay for premiums or copays or any of the other ways health insurance companies stick you with the bill. What\u2019s more, Elizabeth\u2019s plan for Medicare for All doesn\u2019t raise middle-class taxes by one penny,\u201d the calculator states. Warren claims she will fund her $52 trillion proposal via tax hikes on the wealthy, cuts to defense spending, and amnesty for illegal aliens.",

You know, with dad you eat birthday cake for breakfast and then go to Six Flags, and then I hold your hand while you throw up in my purse.\u201d Another Iowan asked Warren how her plan compared to that of\u00a0former vice president and current frontrunner Joe Biden\u2019s. \u201cMy plan compares favorably in that it exists,\u201d she contended. \u201cBiden doesn\u2019t know how to pay for stuff. He just puts down a $50 bill in the Amtrak dining car every few months.\u201d  She then answered a question about estimates of how much her plan would cost. \u201cWe\u2019re talking trillions,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWhen the numbers are this big they\u2019re just pretend. There ain\u2019t no Scrooge McDuck vault. You ready to get red-pilled? Money doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d According to the latest polling data from RealClearPolitics, Elizabeth\u00a0Warren has an average 19.6 percent support, only second to Joe Biden on 29.2 percent. However, she maintains only a slim lead over fellow progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (VM-I) on 16.4 percent, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen.

      "content": " The survey, taken October 18-27, among 1,200 registered voters, found that none of the Democrats in the presidential race,\u00a0not even top candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Joe Biden (D), or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), would be able to defeat Trump in the Lone Star state. Respondents were asked, \u201cWho would you vote for in this possible general election matchup?\u201d The survey showed both Warren and Biden trailing Trump by seven points, 39 percent to Trump\u2019s 46 percent. Sanders, while still losing, suffers a defeat by a smaller margin, 40 percent to Trump\u2019s 45 percent. Even Texas native Beto O\u2019Rourke (D), who dropped out of the presidential race last week, lost to the president, with 41 percent to Trump\u2019s 47 percent. The survey also shows former San Antonio Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) falling to Trump in a head to head matchup by double digits, or 13 percentage points. The margin of error is +/- 2.83 percent. The results were as follows: Trump: 46 percent\n\nWarren: 39 percent Trump: 46 percent\n\nBiden: 39 percent Trump: 45 percent\n\nSanders: 40 percent Trump: 46 percent\n\nCastro: 33 percent Trump: 47 percent\n\nO\u2019Rourke: 41 percent However, the Texas Tribune notes that \u201csignificant numbers of Democrats are holding back their votes \u2014 possibly a sign that while they oppose the Republican incumbent, they favor a different Democrat\u201d: For instance, 89% of Republicans say they would support Trump over Biden, and 5% say they would favor Biden, leaving 6% unwilling to pick. But in the same race, 82% of Democrats favor Biden, and 4% favor Trump, leaving 14% who either like another Democrat more or don\u2019t want to pick yet. The biggest gap was in the Trump-Castro matchup, where 93% of Republicans have a definite choice and only 71% of Democrats do. Joshua Blank, research director of the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin, does not necessarily believe the results will reflect what will happen in the general election, but he noted that the results become \u201cmore Republican\u201d as they \u201cmove from registered voters to likely voters in Texas.\u201d A blue shift scare has been on the mind of the GOP as Democrats continue in their attempts to flip Texas blue. Last year\u2019s Texas senate race, between\u00a0Sen. Ted Cruz (D-TX) and O\u2019Rourke, sparked concerns, as Cruz narrowly defeated his Democrat challenger\u00a050.9 percent to 48.3 percent. However, as Breitbart News pointed out, O\u2019Rourke lost despite \u201ctremendous support from Hollywood and\u00a0double\u00a0the campaign contributions\u2013 $70.2 million to Cruz\u2019s $33.4 million.\u201d Nonetheless, the results were still too close for comfort for the GOP, which has been beefing up resources in Texas ever since. \u201cWithout our 38 electoral votes, no Republican candidate has a path to victory for the foreseeable future. That is why we are asking for the support of people around the country,\u201d\u00a0Republican Party of Texas chairman James Dickey said\u00a0on Sirius XM\u2019s\u00a0Breitbart News Saturday in April. \u201cOne of the things that we face as a challenge in Texas is people assume that Texas always has been and always will be red. That\u2019s not true. It was only 16 years ago that Republicans even took the Texas House,\u201d Dickey continued. \u201cDemocrats have been pouring money and pouring resources into Texas to try and flip Texas,\u201d he added. Trump won Texas in 2016 with 52.2 percent to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 43.2 percent.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren detailed her plan to uphold promises to service members, veterans, and military families by devoting a section of it to the Trump administration\u2019s transgender policy. She vows to, on day one, \u201creverse it\u201d completely. Warren wrote: \u201cOur national security community is weaker when LGBTQ+ Americans are excluded. I have opposed the Trump Administration\u2019s shameful ban on transgender service members\u00a0from the start\u00a0\u2013 and I\u2019ll reverse it on the first day of my presidency. However, the claim that Trump is excluding LGBT Americans from the military and outright \u201cbanning\u201d transgender service members is not necessarily true. The original rule, as Breitbart News reported in January, largely addressed individuals whose gender dysphoria requires expensive surgeries that \u201crender them unable to serve for significant lengths of time.\u201d \u201cThe specific military need is that those serving in uniform must be \u2018free of medical conditions or physical defects that may require excessive time lost from duty,'\u201d as Breitbart News reported in January: The American Psychiatric Association\u2019s current\u00a0Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\u00a0(DSM-IV) has long categorized transsexuality as such a condition, first calling it \u201ctranssexualism,\u201d then \u201cgender identity disorder,\u201d and most recently, \u201cgender dysphoria.\u201d On July 26, 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. military would generally continue its policy of not allowing transgender individuals to serve. DOD subsequently formulated a policy allowing some transgender individuals to serve, but that transgender individuals who would be unable to deploy on miss. This policy was implemented in October 2017. Pursuant to subsequent orders from the commander-in-chief, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis recommended that transgender individuals cannot serve if their gender dysphoria requires in expensive gender reassignment surgery or other therapies that render them unable to serve for significant lengths of time. The specific military need is that those serving in uniform must be \u201cfree of medical conditions or physical defects that may require excessive time lost from duty.\u201d President Trump adopted that recommendation for a revised policy in March 2018. Federal judges in Washington State, California, and D.C. issued injunctions blocking the new policy \u2013 which again, actually merely preserved the decades-long policy \u2013 and the Trump administration appealed all three. Nonetheless, Warren took her pledge a step further, promising \u201cgender-affirming and culturally-competent\u201d health care for LGBT service members and veterans. \u201cA Warren VA will ensure that every LGBTQ+ person can get the equitable, gender-affirming, and culturally-competent health care they need,\u201d Warren stated, specifying that it includes taxpayer-funded \u201ctransition-related surgery, and allowing providers discretion to deem gender-affirming procedures as medically necessary based on an individualized assessment.\u201d According to Warren, the \u201cgender-affirming\u201d health care \u201cwill also be available under Medicare for All.\u201d \u201cProfessional medical associations recognize the need for transition-related surgery,\u201d she added. \u201cVA\u2019s blanket exclusion policy of medically necessary treatment is not grounded in medicine; it should be repealed.\u201d Warren also promised to \u201cinvest in the VA\u201d and said her administration will \u201cnot cut the high-quality, evidence-based, culturally competent programs that our veterans rely on,\u201d once again touting Medicare All as beneficial for veterans. \u201cAnd under Medicare for All, veterans will all have high-quality health coverage that gives them the option to seek care from non-VA doctors and hospitals for no additional cost,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t a VA close to where they live, Medicare for All will ensure that veterans still get the care they need when they need it,\u201d she added.",

      "content": " The former Obama administration essentially dismissed Warren\u2019s plan as a pipe dream during an appearance on CNBC on Monday. \u201cA good question for her is, given neither this nor the next Congress will enact your plan, don\u2019t tell us what you\u2019d like to do. Tell us about what you would do; what you think is in the realm of possible,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThis debate, this is just basically like saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to buy a unicorn and I\u2019m going to pay for it with a unicorn,'\u201d he added:  He later clarified his statement in an email to Squawk Box, noting he does, in fact, \u201clike the aspirations\u201d of the Medicare for All plan but suggested Democrats are wasting their time \u201carguing about things that are very unlikely to be legislated.\u201d \u201cMy point was that while I very much like the aspirations of the \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 plan, we shouldn\u2019t spend too much time arguing about things that are very unlikely to be legislated,\u201d he wrote, according to CNBC. Warren unveiled her $52 trillion plan on Friday, which she claimed would not raise taxes on the middle class. That claim, however, has been under scrutiny, as some suggest the\u00a0Employer Medicare Contribution \u201cessentially amounts to an employer-side payroll tax, which many economists say harms workers in the form of suppressed wages,\u201d as Breitbart News reported. Warren claims she will pay for her multi-trillion dollar proposal via tax hikes on the wealthy, cutting military spending, and pursuing amnesty. Biden initially questioned Warren\u2019s plan through his deputy campaign member Kate Bedingfield, who said Warren\u2019s proposal amounted to \u201cmathematical gymnastics.\u201d Warren responded to the Biden campaign\u2019s critique, citing former Obama administration officials who authenticated her plan\u2019s revenue projections:  Bernstein ultimately echoed the Biden campaign\u2019s concerns. \u201cMy biggest misgiving about the plan is that it\u2019s really hard to transition 160 million people from employer-provided coverage \u2014 many of them, and I\u2019m one of them, really like that coverage \u2014 without a much longer transition plan than I see in here,\u201d he added.",

In an October 16 interview\u00a0on CNBC, Cooperman predicted that stocks would fall 25 percent if Warren were elected. A week later, he told\u00a0Politico\u00a0that Warren was soiling the American dream. That prompted Warren to respond by urging Cooperman, who pledged in 2010 to give his vast fortune to charity during his lifetime, to \u201cpitch in a bit more.\u201d  Last week, Cooperman sent\u00a0a letter to Warren arguing that her tweet \u201cdemonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of who I am, what I stand for, and why I believe so many of your economic policy initiatives are misguided.\u201d \u201cFor you to suggest that capitalism is a dirty word and that these people, as a group, are ingrates who didn\u2019t earn their riches \u2026 and now don\u2019t pull their weight societally indicates that you either are grossly uninformed or are knowingly warping the facts,\u201d Cooperman wrote.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The former vice president, who was once the Democrat frontrunner but has been eclipsed by Warren in recent months, made the comments in a self-published Medium piece titled, \u201cI Have Fought for the Democratic Party My Whole Career.\u201d The piece, although not mentioning Warren by name, set out to repudiate not only her suggestion that Biden should be seeking the Republican nomination but also the \u201cangry unyielding viewpoint\u201d that those who \u201cdisagree with you \u2026 must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.\u201d \u201cSome call it the \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach to politics. But it\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view,\u201d the former vice president wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s representative of an elitism that working and middle class people do not share: \u2018We know best; you know nothing\u2019. \u2018If you were only as smart as I am you would agree with me.'\u201d Biden proceeded to argue such tactics were not conducive to getting \u201canything done\u201d or building a party that was capable of beating President Donald Trump in 2020. \u201cI learned a long time ago that if you question someone\u2019s motivations rather than their judgment you get nowhere,\u201d he stated. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get past go if you start off by saying the other person is in the pocket of special interests or is corrupt.\u201d Despite the pleas for \u201ccompromise\u201d and \u201cunity,\u201d Biden spent a good deal of the piece highlighting his own policy prescriptions, many of which are directly in opposition to those being proposed by more liberal Democrats like Warren. In particular, the former vice president touted his proposal for expanding ObamaCare through a public option, which Warren and others have claimed will not be as efficient as Medicare for All. \u201cI stand with the Democratic Party of Barack Obama \u2014 the party that fought for and passed the Affordable Care Act \u2014 an historic transformation of our health care system that took a generation to achieve,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cI\u2019m not walking away from ObamaCare \u2026 Maybe others want to walk away from ObamaCare \u2014 I don\u2019t.\u201d The medium piece comes as the Biden and Warren camps have traded barbs back and forth in recent weeks. Biden, specifically, has attacked Warren for lying about how she would pay for her Medicare for All proposal without raising taxes on the middle class. It was in response to such attacks last week that Warren suggested Biden was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d Even though Biden had technically started the altercation, the former vice president\u2019s campaign manager used the opening to attack\u00a0Warren\u2019s prior Republican affiliation. Many have noted that the flare-up between the two camps underscores the ideological divisions raging within the Democrat Party at the moment. Biden, who claims to be the only Democrat to win back the white working class, is campaigning as something of a moderate that will bring forth incremental change. The strategy is evident by the former vice president\u2019s policy platform, which is full of ideas that were seen as too radical during the Obama years but are now considered tepid when compared to those advocated by progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Warren, on the other hand, is a proponent of radical change, as exhibited by her endorsements of a wealth tax and the Green New Deal. Adding to the antagonism between the camps is the precarious position Biden finds himself in three months away from the first nominating contest in Iowa. Although the former vice president started the race as the clear frontrunner, leading the field by as much as\u00a032 percentage points\u00a0at one point, his campaign has steadily declined. Biden\u2019s decreasing political fortunes have comes as Warren\u2019s have\u00a0only increased. The Massachusetts Democrat has leapfrogged Biden in the early primary and caucus states. One recent poll out of Iowa showed Warren leading the field with 28 percent support among Democrats, while Biden was relegated to fourth place\u00a0with only 12 percent. A similar situation has played out nationally, by which most polls show Warren leading Biden, albeit with a narrow margin. As Biden\u2019s campaign spins downward, his attacks on Warren, who many now acknowledge as the frontrunner, have only increased, culminating in his Medium piece on Tuesday. \u201cI have fought for the Democratic party my whole career. I know what we stand for, who we stand with and what we believe. And it\u2019s not just policies or issues. It\u2019s in my bones,\u201d the former vice president stated. \u201cThat\u2019s not something everyone in this primary can say.\u201d",

She says she based this on \u201cfamily lore,\u201d but then there are members of her family who share her lore who are unaware of the whole Indian thing.

Warren is not just a liar who stole a cultural identity for her own mercenary purposes, she has been pathological about this lie straight to through to last year when a DNA test conclusively proved she is no more Indian than the average white American. In fact, she probably has less Indian genome (1/1024) than the average white American. Nevertheless, she persisted\u2026 Persisted to lie \u2014 with the help of the disgraced Boston Globe.

Believe it or not, she has still not admitted she\u2019s whiter than a Joe Biden campaign rally. Elizabeth Warren is a pathological, neurotic, lying lunatic. And if the \u201cred face\u201d charade doesn\u2019t convince you of that, how about her attempt to destroy the American health care system and economy with her batshit crazy MFA proposal, an idea so awful, it appears to be unraveling her frontrunner status for the 2020 Democrat nomination. THE DUMB FAKE INDIAN How Warren got herself into this mess is also part of the story of her fakeness. You see, she\u2019s just not all that bright. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s as lacking in the IQ department as Joe Biden, Cory Booker, or Kamala Harris, but she\u2019s nowhere near as smart at Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, or Julian Castro. I honestly had no idea how dumb the Cherokee Princess was until she still raised her hand at that first debate to promise she would strip every American of their private health insurance coverage and then force us into MFA. And that was dumb, y\u2019all\u2026 Real dumb. To begin with, Americans are quite content with their private health insurance plans. Secondly, MFA will bankrupt the country. Actually, that\u2019s not true. MFA can\u2019t bankrupt the country anymore than a unicorn, because both are fantasies sprinkled with fairy dust by leprechauns waving Harry Potter\u2019s magic wand. You see, there is this little thing we commoners call The Math. Warren, of course, as she proved with her DNA test, is impervious to The Math. But her blissful ignorance will never change the fact that The Math is still\u2026 The Math. THE MATH Fifty-two TRILLION dollars over ten years. Fifty-two TRILLION\u2026 TRILLION. With a \u201cT.\u201d That\u2019s how much MFA will cost and Warren still promises, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to raise taxes on the middle class by one penny to finance Medicare for All.\u201d Oh, okay\u2026 I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no forked tongue at work there. Get this\u2026 The federal government\u2019s entire budget for 2019 is $4.4 trillion and is already in deficit $1 trillion. Still, the Cherokee Princess wants us to believe it\u2019s a good idea to not only herd every American into a one-size-fits-all government plan, and do so just a few years after the one-size-fits-all Veterans health care plan resulted in a dead veterans, she also claims she can more than double the annual federal budget without raising taxes on the middle class. Please. Warren says she will work this miracle by taxing corporations for $9 trillion of the $52 trillion \u2014 TRILLION! \u2014 and they won\u2019t even feel it because that\u2019s what they pay now to fund health insurance for their employees. Part of the rest of the $52 trillion \u2014 TRILLION! \u2014 will come from the wealthy, and the well-connected\u201d paying \u201ctheir fair share.\u201d The most recent count I could find, shows that there are only 639 billionaires in America. When you realize that a \u201ctrillion\u201d is a thousand billions, that pretty much says it all. If we take every penny from every American billionaire, it might cover a year or two of Warren\u2019s lunacy\u2026 And then what? \u201cAdditional taxes on foreign earnings and financial transactions would also be implemented under the plan.\u201d Warren says, and the remaining $30 trillion \u2014 TRILLION! \u2014 will be covered by \u2014 get this \u2014 \u201cexisting federal and state spending.\u201d Oh, we\u2019re just going to find $30 trillion from those big piles of money sitting around unclaimed. You know what, I\u2019m gunna go get me a beer. REMEMBER OBAMACARE\u2019S FAKE MATH? Hey, remember when Obamacare was going to be paid for and even decrease the deficit? Remember when Barry and his sycophant media sold us the audacious lie Obamacare would decrease the deficit by a whopping $100 billion over ten years? Well, to the surprise of no one, Obamacare adds hundreds of millions to the deficit, and if that\u2019s not scary enough, get this \u2014 Obamacare is nothing compared to MFA\u2026 At its inception, Obamacare was projected to cost $940 billion over ten years. In other words, Obamacare was supposed to cost 1/50th the amount Warren wants to spend on MFA. But by 2012, in just a few short years, we learned that Obamacare would actually cost nearly twice that initial estimate, but even so, it is still 1/25th smaller than MFA. So\u2026 After Obama and all his men couldn\u2019t properly calculate the cost of their bill\u2026 After Warren and her press sycophants couldn\u2019t properly calculate her microscopic claim to Indian heritage\u2026 Does anyone believe Warren\u2019s $52 trillion \u2014 TRILLION! \u2014 won\u2019t end up costing much, much more, even though, as is, she is already more than doubling the ENTIRE federal budget.

      "author": "David Ng",
      "content": " Yelp CEO\u00a0Jeremy Stoppelman told Buzzfeed News in an interview published Tuesday that Google\u2019s practices amount to anti-competitive behavior. \u201cIf Google is the starting place for all of the people that are tapping into the web, to the extent they get in front of consumers and block them from finding the best information, it\u2019s really problematic, and that can stifle innovation,\u201d he said. Yelp has spent years trying to sound the alarm over Google\u2019s practices. It has accused the search engine of displaying its own user reviews ahead of those from the competition, including sites like Yelp. \u201cThe only way that we could get them to do the right thing in the early days was by shaming them in the press. So that\u2019s where this all began,\u201d\u00a0Stoppelman told Buzzfeed. \u201cAnd then eventually they got tired of that and \u2026 as we would shame them, they\u2019d get less responsive. And so we would naturally progress to the next level, which was \u2018Okay, the only source of power now that might be able to check them is government.'\u201d Efforts to break up Google are now gaining momentum as\u00a0the search engine has come under antitrust scrutiny from politicians on both sides on the aisle. President Donald Trump has suggested that Google is a monopoly while Democratic hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has introduced a plan to split up big tech companies like Google and Amazon. European Union regulators are also taking a look at Google\u2019s practices. In September, state attorneys general announced that they will begin an antitrust investigation into Google, looking into whether the company\u2019s control of the online search market stifles competition and hurts consumers. Comcast recently joined\u00a0a\u00a0regulatory fight against Google\u2019s control of the online advertising market. Google has denied that it engages in illegal business practices. Yelp is arguing that\u00a0when Google displays its own results ahead of the competition, it deprives consumers of choice. \u201cGoogle\u2019s reviews\u2026 It is kind of comical that they call their\u2019s reviews!\u201d Stoppelman told Buzzfeed. \u201cMost, probably like 60% or 70%, of their reviews are actually ratings with no text. But they have to compete against us, so they\u2019re generous with what they call a review.\u201d Stoppelman said he feels that the rest of the world is beginning to see Yelp\u2019s perspective on Google\u2019s practices. \u201cThe first seven years or eight years, there was a lot of eye-rolling in Silicon Valley about Yelp being a complainer, or I\u2019m a whiner, or this is a stupid issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the reality is now the world has caught up.\u201d Follow David Ng on Twitter\u00a0@HeyItsDavidNg.

The poll, taken November 3-5, 2019, among 1500 individuals (1201 registered voters), showed Sanders in third place with 14 percent support, followed by Buttigieg with eight percent and Harris with six percent.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " During an interview with CNN political commentator Angela Rye in Greensboro, North Carolina, Warren named two individuals she would consider including in her administration: Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (D) and \u201csomeone like\u201d Melody Barnes:  However, giving either of the individuals a position in her administration would call her hardline stance on standing up to both lobbyists and big firms into question. Patrick, for example, joined Bain Capital in 2015 and serves as a \u201cManaging Director and Co-Managing Partner of the Double Impact business,\u201d according to his bio on the Bain Capital website. Patrick defended his role in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper last year. \u201cI\u2019m having a terrific time in this fund that we launched,\u201d Patrick stated. \u201cIt\u2019s a fund that invests in companies in order to drive social and environmental impact, and it\u2019s part of this impact investing industry or trend.\u201d \u201cOne of my partners describes \u2026 impact investing as the laboratory where capitalists work to reform capitalism,\u201d he added:  Meanwhile, Barnes has an extensive history of lobbying, doing so in 2003 and 2004 \u201cfor liberal advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the American Constitution Society and the Center for Reproductive Rights,\u201d as Politico\u00a0and other outlets\u00a0reported:  This stands in stark contrast with the hardline positions Warren outlines in her sweeping anti-corruption plan, which devotes a significant portion to lobbyist activities and what the presidential hopeful calls the \u201crevolving door between government and giant, dominant firms.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the issue of industry lobbyists and top execs spinning freely through the revolving door to and from important government positions in both Democratic and Republican administrations,\u201d Warren wrote. She continued: But giant corporations should compete on a level playing field \u2013 and they shouldn\u2019t be able to rig the system by scooping up every available former government official in an effort to get federal regulators off their backs. That\u2019s why I have put forward proposals to get big money out of politics and to end lobbying as we know it \u2013 and it\u2019s why I\u2019m going further to slam shut the revolving door between government and giant, dominant firms. This would not be the first time Warren has faced a contradiction in her rhetoric and actions. Her campaign is funded, in part, by $10.4 million from her senatorial campaign. At the time, she happily courted big donors and received at least $95,000 from \u201cvarious lobbyists,\u201d as CNBC reported. In May, Warren threw support behind Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s (R-SC) Democrat challenger Jaime Harrison, a former corporate lobbyist who worked for the Podesta Group from 2008-2016:  In September, Warren tapped former Planned Parenthood leader Kimberly Diaz Scott, who registered as a lobbyist, to head up her presidential campaign in Florida.",

However, the paper quoted an advisor who indicated that Bloomberg has yet to make an official decision. Warren, who has championed her \u201cUltra-Millionaire Tax,\u201d took a shot at the billionaire following the report, encouraging him to fill out her calculator \u201cfor the billionaires.\u201d \u201cWelcome to the race, @MikeBloomberg! If you\u2019re looking for policy plans that will make a huge difference for working people and which are very popular, start here,\u201d she wrote, providing a link to her calculator:  \u201cSome billionaires seem confused about how much they would pay under Elizabeth\u2019s Ultra-Millionaire Tax. Don\u2019t worry, now we have a calculator for that too,\u201d Warren\u2019s website states. The calculator asks the user if he or she is a billionaire. If the user chooses \u201cno,\u201d the calculator provides a list of well-known billionaires and encourages the user to \u201cpick a billionaire to see how much they would pay under Elizabeth\u2019s wealth tax.\u201d Bloomberg is included on the list. \u201cMIKE BLOOMBERG WOULD PAY $3.079 BILLION NEXT YEAR UNDER ELIZABETH\u2019S WEALTH TAX,\u201d her calculator states in all caps. It adds: Mike Bloomberg has a net worth of $52,000,000,000. Don\u2019t worry too much about Mike Bloomberg \u2013 if history is any guide, if billionaires do nothing other than invest their wealth in the stock market, it\u2019s likely that their wealth will continue to grow. Elizabeth\u2019s wealth tax, which only impacts America\u2019s 75,000 wealthiest families, would generate enough revenue to cover universal child care, quality public education, forgive student loan debt, provide free public college, and help finance Medicare for All. As reported in October, Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton have been reportedly keeping an eye on the Democrat primary, although many Democrats believe neither would officially jump into the race unless Joe Biden (D) flounders.",

      "subtitle": "Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is again considering running for the Democrat nomination for president in 2020 after previously ruling out a run, a move that comes as former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has filed presidential primary paperwork in Alabama signaling he may be a late entrant to the race.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " All of this comes as speculation builds that former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the failed 2016 Democrat presidential nominee, may run again in 2020 as well. Holder did very publicly flirt with running in 2020 before, even making the rounds to travel to some early presidential states for key speeches, but he ultimately announced earlier this year he would not run. In March 2019, he came out and said he would not be running in 2020 and that he planned to instead focus his efforts on redistricting efforts. But now, given how weak the rest of the Democrat presidential field is in 2020, and with other top talent showing that the water is definitely still warm, Holder appears to be reconsidering and thinking about getting into the race after all. Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson reported late Thursday evening that Holder has been discussing a late entrance into the crowded Democrat field with a handful of close advisers and political consultants:  The news that Holder is reconsidering his decision to bow out on 2020 comes as Bloomberg has filed paperwork in Alabama, which has a Friday filing deadline, to run for president. He has not yet, according to multiple reports, made a decision on whether he will run for president or not, but filing paperwork in Alabama ensures he would have a shot at ballot access there should he mount a national campaign for the Democrat nomination. Politico reported Thursday night: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is preparing to file paperwork to qualify for the Democratic presidential primary in Alabama, ahead of a Friday deadline. The move would be a first step toward a national campaign, though Bloomberg has not made a final decision to run. Bloomberg aide Howard Wolfson is quoted in the story as well, suggesting that Bloomberg is actively considering jumping into the still-crowded 2020 Democrat presidential primary field. Wolfson said: We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated \u2014 but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that. If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America\u2019s biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America\u2019s toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist. All of this comes as Clinton, whom some have speculated may get in herself, again toyed with the idea publicly during an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin this week and then tweeted video of the joke:  Clinton, Bloomberg, and now Holder all considering late entrances to the crowded 2020 Democrat presidential primary field comes as its onetime frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden, has proven particularly weak against his opponents. Biden\u2019s deep corruption concerns with regard to his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealing in Ukraine and China, and potentially elsewhere around the world in shoes yet to drop, have Democrats concerned that a much more radical leftist like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) could win the Democrat nomination. While the hard left of the Democrat Party led by the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d believes that nominating a leftist socialist like Sanders or Warren would energize the party\u2019s base and bring an army to take on President Donald Trump and his base in November 2020, more establishment Democrats are concerned that Warren or Sanders being the nominee would turn off battleground voters and cede the White House back to Trump in 2020. Most of the \u201cSquad,\u201d\u00a0Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY),\u00a0 Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) endorsed Sanders since the last Democrat debate in October, while the freshman group\u2019s fourth member Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) endorsed Warren. Members have insisted there is no divide in the group. Biden\u2019s polling numbers have steadily sunk in recent months, to the point where he has lost the frontrunner status he enjoyed at the beginning of his campaign. Warren has replaced Biden as the frontrunner in many national polls, and especially in several key battleground states. Biden\u2019s numbers keep slipping as the public learns more and more about his son\u2019s position on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where he was paid more than $80,000 per month. Questionable Hunter Biden dealings in China, too, have put a spotlight on Biden corruption concerns, all of which in their totality are a nearly daily national news story given the fact that House Democrats have decided to proceed with an impeachment inquiry into President Trump over the fact that Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s new president to investigate corruption including what happened with Hunter Biden and Burisma. If Bloomberg or Clinton decided to launch national presidential campaigns in the next few weeks, they would have considerable resources at the ready. Bloomberg, a billionaire, has immense financial resources at his disposal, while Clinton as the party\u2019s nominee in 2016 and the former first lady, as well as a leader with a national profile and universal name identification among voters, would quickly be able to assemble the structures necessary to compete in the upcoming primaries and caucuses. Holder, though, may have a rougher go of it given that he\u2019s never run a national campaign before and does not have the financial resources of Bloomberg:  Holder does have deep ties to former President Barack Obama, however, and is considered a favorite among the Democrat base given the work he did to help Obama cover up a variety of scandals, including most notably the Operation Fast and Furious scandal. Holder\u2019s coverup of documents on behalf of Obama, who asserted executive privilege to withhold the information from Congress, led to him being the first-ever and only sitting Attorney General of the United States to be held in contempt of Congress. The U.S. House in 2012 voted Holder into both civil and criminal contempt of Congress over the Fast and Furious scandal, just one of many scandals that plagued Holder\u2019s Department of Justice.",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Earlier this year, Bloomberg backed away from a presidential run after clashing with left-wing Democrats. He said that while he could defeat President Donald Trump, he had doubts about the primary: \u201cI am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field,\u201d he wrote. At the time, Bloomberg went further, arguing that \u201cuntil 2021, and possibly longer, our only real hope for progress lies outside of Washington.\u201d He pledged to continue to devote himself to cherished causes, such as gun control and climate change (which he has pursued by literally paying the salaries of state prosecutors\u00a0around the country). The mayor who tried to ban large sodas\u00a0and claims China\u2019s Xi Jinping is \u201cnot a dictator\u201d was bearish about his chances. Left unsaid at the time was the fact that former Vice President Joe Biden had entered the race, making it harder for Bloomberg and other so-called \u201cmoderates\u201d to join. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who had also toyed with an independent run for president, likewise deferred and then declined to run. Biden, though nearing 80, was the heir apparent to Obama\u2019s donors, if not his endorsement. The party establishment realized it had to stay united to win. But then Biden began to falter \u2014 first in the debates, where he was embarrassed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) for his collegiality with former segregationists, and then in the polls. While still nominally the nationwide frontrunner , Biden has lost ground to Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT). In a recent Iowa poll, Biden was in fourth place \u2014 even losing to South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has surged to second there. Moreover, Biden has also lost the battle for the soul of the party. Radical socialist policies have become the default among Democrat activists. Both Warren and Sanders back \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a government takeover of health care that would cost $52 trillion under Warren\u2019s plan. She denies that her plan would impose new taxes on middle class families, but Sanders, whose plan has been costed at a mere $32 trillion, openly and proudly admits that it would. In January, when \u201cMedicare for All\u201d moved to the fore \u2014 thanks in part to the efforts of newly-elected \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) \u2014 Bloomberg told New Hampshire voters frankly: \u201cYou could never afford that, you\u2019re talking about trillions of dollars.\u201d He also embraced a version of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d \u2014 but one that he said would be \u201cachievable,\u201d in contrast to her plan to kill the fossil fuel industry. Bloomberg was incredulous at Democrats\u2019 other policies. He blasted Warren\u2019s \u201cwealth tax\u201d on billionaires such as himself: \u201cIf you want to look at a system that\u2019s non-capitalistic, just take a look at what was perhaps the wealthiest country in the world, and today, people are starving to death \u2014 it\u2019s called Venezuela,\u201d he said. And: \u201cI\u2019m a little bit tired of listening to things that are pie in the sky, that we never are going to pass or never are going to afford.\u201d It was Joe Biden\u2019s job to stop all of that, and appeal to Democrats in the \u201cbattleground states\u201d who prefer a moderate candidate. But he failed, and none of the other candidates seem to be electable. That is why Democrats have chosen impeachment: they do not believe their candidates can win. And it is why Bloomberg is thinking of jumping in \u2014 in\u00a0Alabama, of all places. He like much of America, is voting \u201cno confidence\u201d in the Democratic presidential field. Joel B.

      "content": " Those of you looking for even more proof that the establishment media have almost no impact on public opinion need only read on\u2026 Keep in mind that this a poll of 835 registered voters taken between October 30 and November 2, 2019 \u2014 or while Democrats and their media allies are on a 24/7 crusade to impeach Trump. Favorable / Unfavorable Donald Trump: 44 / 54 percent Quid Pro Joe Biden: 43 / 50 percent Bernie \u201cThe Fossil\u201d Sanders: 41 / 54 percent Cherokee Princess Elizabeth Warren: 42 / 44 percent Dingbat Kamala Harris: 27 / 46 percent Mean Little Mayor Pete Buttigieg: 27 / 34 percent If that is not interesting enough for you, since this poll was taken in late September, Trump\u2019s numbers have improved\u2026 Previously, he was at 43 percent favorable, 56 percent unfavorable. And guess whose numbers got worse, and I mean a whole lot worse\u2026 Yep, Slow Joe Biden\u2019s\u2026 Which, once again, proves that the Ukrainian torpedoes aimed at the Bad Orange Man went off course and nailed Old Joe. In September, before we learned how Joe and his son Hunter looted at least two foreign countries, Joe sat at 46 percent favorable, 45 percent unfavorable. That\u2019s a loss of eight net points while Trump gained three points. Granted, Trump is more upside-down than Biden, but only by three points (10 to 7), which is well within the margin of error. Buttigieg is also upside down by seven points, while Bernie is buried by 13 points and Kamala by 19 points \u2014 which is an accurate reflection of just how awful she is. One warning sign for Trump is that only 42 percent of those polled believe he deserves reelection, while 55 percent do not want him reelected. But even on this point, since September, Trump has improved from a 39 to 57 percent response. So he has been gaining ground \u2026 during impeachment! But here\u2019s the other thing\u2026 Even if 55 percent of the country wants Trump replaced in 2020, they have to replace him with someone else. There has to be an acceptable alternative, and what we have here is a Democrat field so weak, so extreme and unappealing, Big Guns like Michael Bloomberg and Eric Holder are seriously considering jumping in at this very late date. As far as impeachment, despite 24/7 negative news coverage and selective leaks, this pig just isn\u2019t going to fly. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to read too much into differences within the margin of error. But the fact that there is no significant change in the current results suggests that the opening salvo of the House impeachment inquiry has had little impact on the overall 2020 dynamic. Voter opinion remains baked in,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute. Ya think? According to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Trump currently enjoys a relatively healthy job approval rating of 44 percent, and the polls gauging impeachment have either stalled or are losing altitude. Monmouth has Trump\u2019s job approval at 45 percent. Most telling, at least in my opinion, is that impeachment has not boosted the cable news ratings. Far-left CNN is actually attracting fewer viewers when compared to last year. This shows an extraordinary amount of voter indifference towards impeachment. Americans just don\u2019t see impeachment as a big deal, as anything more than just another partisan food fight. If voters believed there was an actual crime here, cable news ratings would be through the roof, and Trump\u2019s favorability, reelect, and job approval ratings would not be on the upswing. Bottom line: this is the media fail of all media fails. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.",

Sources close to Bloomberg initially mused he would not enter the presidential race unless Joe Biden (D) showed signs of weakening. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has certainly put a dent in his support in recent months, signaling the nomination is not a lock for the former vice president. That considered, Bloomberg is taking steps to self-fund his campaign \u2013 a clear advantage considering his late dive into the field.\u00a0 A source close to the former mayor told Axios that the billionaire is reportedly willing to \u201cspend whatever it takes to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cMike will spend whatever it takes to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe nation is about to see a very different campaign than we\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201d While Bloomberg has yet to make a final decision, Axios reports that one is coming \u201csoon\u201d and added that he will \u201cquickly ramp up in other states with deadlines approaching, including Arkansas, New Hampshire, Florida, California and Texas.\u201d His consideration stands in contrast to the position he held in March, writing in an op-ed that he was \u201cclear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.\u201d \u201cI know what it takes to run a winning campaign, and every day when I read the news, I grow more frustrated by the incompetence in the Oval Office. I know we can do better as a country. And I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field,\u201d he added. Both Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) gave Bloomberg a cold welcome following the reports of his potential presidential bid.

Both Warren and Sanders have unveiled radical redistribution plans as key features of their presidential platforms. Warren\u2019s \u201cUltra-Millionaire Tax\u201d targets individuals with more than $50 million in assets, levying a two percent tax, which goes up to three percent for those with more than $1 billion in assets. However, her $52 trillion Medicare for All plan increases the taxes on the ultra-wealthy, \u201casking billionaires to pitch in six cents on each dollar of net worth above $1 billion.\u201d Sanders\u2019 plan also targets America\u2019s ultra-wealthy, proposing a one percent tax on couples with a net worth in excess of $32 million: The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. \u201cBillionaires should not exist,\u201d he declared following his plan\u2019s rollout:  Clinton signaled that neither of their proposals is feasible. \u201cIf you were going to do a wealth tax and it was on assets \u2026 how you would value it is, I think, complicated to start with,\u201d she said. \u201cBut assume you can get some system of evaluation, people would literally have to sell assets to pay the tax on the assets that they owned before the wealth tax was levied,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat would be incredibly disruptive, so I think there are other ways to raise the revenues,\u201d she added. Both Warren and Sanders took aim at billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who is close to making a decision on a presidential bid, following the reports that he filed\u00a0presidential primary paperwork in Alabama ahead of the deadline. \u201cWelcome to the race, @MikeBloomberg!

Medicare for All, as I put this together, covers everyone, regardless of immigration status, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Warren said to applause:  Notably, Warren said she will fund her $52 trillion Medicare for All proposal, in part, by driving up immigration levels, but she failed to explain how the influx \u2013 granting amnesty to 11-22 million illegal aliens \u2013 would affect what some fear would already be an overextended program. \u201cI support immigration reform that\u2019s consistent with our values, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and expanded legal immigration consistent with my principles,\u201d Warren detailed in her plan. \u201cThat\u2019s not only the right thing to do \u2013 it also increases federal revenue we can dedicate to Medicare for All as new people come into the system and pay taxes,\u201d she added.",

      "subtitle": "The elite class and Hillary Clinton, specifically, are unsatisfied with the current Democrat primary field and have signaled their dissatisfaction in a variety of ways in recent weeks, from refusing to endorse former Vice President Joe Biden (D) to dismissing the ultra-far-left candidates\u2019 radical agendas.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " There is no shortage of candidates in the current Democrat primary field. Democrats have, on paper, everything they have claimed to want in terms of diversity in their lineup. They have multiple women \u2014 Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), and self-help guru Marianne Williamson (D). They have candidates who represent racial minorities \u2014 Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) \u2014 as well as a candidate who embodies their self-proclaimed devotion to the LGBT community. Yet, despite that, Democrat elites like Clinton are unsatisfied, indicating a deepening divide within the Democrat Party. The first presidential primary is less than three months away, yet select Democrats are still mulling a last-minute run. On Thursday, reports indicated that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg filed presidential primary paperwork in Alabama, with sources adding that he is \u201cclose\u201d to coming up with a final decision on a presidential bid. Similarly, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is reportedly considering a long-shot bid, and Hillary Clinton has been teasing a run for weeks, failing to use her recent interviews to quash the rumors. It has been widely believed among Democrats that Bloomberg and Clinton would not run unless Biden, who was long believed to be the unshakeable frontrunner, showed signs of wavering. Both Warren and Sanders have managed to put a dent in his support, keeping potential candidates like Clinton on the fence and prepared to pounce. Bloomberg\u2019s, Holder\u2019s, and Clinton\u2019s purported considerations speak volumes about the state of the current Democrat field. Democrat elites are unsatisfied with the choices, fearing Biden\u2019s lack of stamina in a general election matchup against Trump and questioning the electability of Warren and Sanders, who have unabashedly embraced far-left proposals and positions that strategic Democrats, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), have long attempted to keep at bay. Clinton has openly criticized the positions of Warren and Sanders, causing some to wonder if she is subtly attempting to undermine the field or in the very least, influence the candidates\u2019 positions. She appeared at the\u00a0New York Times\u2019\u00a0DealBook conference this week and took aim at ultra-wealthy tax proposals and Medicare for All \u2014 two progressive plans both Warren and Sanders not only support, but champion. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how that could work, and I don\u2019t see other examples anywhere else in the world where it has actually worked over a long period of time,\u201d Clinton\u00a0said of the wealth tax proposals, calling them \u201ccomplicated.\u201d \u201cIf you were going to do a wealth tax and it was on assets \u2026 how you would value it is, I think, complicated to start with,\u201d she said. \u201cBut assume you can get some system of evaluation, people would literally have to sell assets to pay the tax on the assets that they owned before the wealth tax was levied,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat would be incredibly disruptive, so I think there are other ways to raise the revenues,\u201d she added. Clinton also expressed doubt that Warren\u2019s $52 trillion Medicare for All plan would ever pass. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Clinton replied when asked if she thought Warren\u2019s plan would pass. \u201cI don\u2019t, but the goal is the right goal. \u201d \u201cI believe the smarter approach is to build on what we have, a public option is something I\u2019ve been in favor of for a very long time. I don\u2019t believe we should be in the midst of a big disruption while we are trying to get to 100 percent coverage and deal with costs,\u201d she added. Clinton has also taken direct aim at candidates like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), calling her a \u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d and suggesting that she is a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d \u201cThey [Republicans] know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it,\u201d Clinton said on the Campaign HQ podcast with Barack Obama\u2019s former campaign manager David Plouffe last month. Time and time again, rather than encouraging Democrats to rally behind a candidate in the existing presidential primary field, Clinton has subtly hinted that she could jump in the race instead. In October, President Trump tweeted that \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d should join the race \u201cto try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren\u201d as long as she explains \u201call of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u2018C\u2019 Subpoena!\u201d Clinton replied, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job,\u201d and fueled further speculation during an appearance on\u00a0PBS NewsHour. \u201cMaybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, just seriously, I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\u201d Clinton kicked off an additional 2020 buzz on social media after posting a quote from\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9 about the need to \u201ctake\u201d power:   @Beyonce speaks the truth.\u2063 \u2063 #GutsyWomen A post shared by  Hillary Clinton (@hillaryclinton) on Oct 22, 2019 at 10:03am PDT The twice-failed presidential candidate\u2019s book tour has almost doubled as an outlet to express her views on the 2020 race. She dropped yet another doubtful analysis of the current 2020 field during an event at Portland\u2019s Revolution Hall last month, suggesting that it would be nearly impossible for anyone in the current field to unseat Trump in the next election in the event that he is not impeached. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know who\u2019s going to be the best candidate to beat this president, assuming this president is still running,\u201d she said. She continued: We have a number of very able, very admirable candidates who are vying for the nomination, but at the end of the day, there are a lot of forecasters who are saying, \u2018Look, if the economy stays in good shape and he\u2019s not impeached, or he\u2019s impeached but not convicted, it\u2019s going to be very, very hard,\u2019 because of all of the advantages that he will have on the stuff we were just talking about like suppression and everything else. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has done little to extinguish the mounting rumors, explaining that his wife \u201cmay or may not ever run for anything\u201d during an appearance at Georgetown Law\u2019s second annual Ruth Bader Ginsburg Lecture in Washington, DC, last month. Most recently, Clinton dodged a question on whether she is planning a last-minute jump into the race, reverting to jogging jokes at the New York Times\u2019 DealBook conference. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, to run? You know, I have always been a very, very slow runner. I am embarrassingly slow,\u201d she said, continuing her bit. \u201cThere\u2019s been some teasing and some hinting that, maybe, you\u2019re sitting off in the wings here and waiting for some moment,\u201d Andrew Ross Sorkin said. Clinton, however, refused to answer the question directly:  Look, I think I would have been a really good president. I think I could have been a very effective leader. We have real divides in the country over all kinds of things, but I certainly, in my time in the Senate and secretary of state, worked really hard, as you say, to actually solve problems, not exacerbate them or ignore them. I would have done everything I could to try to get us positioned for the future. That\u2019s what a leader is supposed to do. Elections are supposed to be about the future and leadership should be about the future. I think I could have done a really good job. I think the last election was deeply flawed and that there were so many unprecedented problems in that election that it\u2019s almost hard to make sense of. Sources for both the New York Times and Washington Post have said that Clinton has not ruled out a presidential bid and is actively keeping an eye on it, which is overwhelmingly evident to those who have been tracking her latest remarks. The possible late entrances \u2014 from Clinton, Bloomberg, and Holder \u2014 indicate the growing worry over not only the direction of the Democrat field but the Democrat Party\u2019s ability to defeat Trump in 2020. While Democrat voters are more open to radical policies, such as Medicare for All and multitrillion dollar proposals to combat climate change, there are growing concerns that those proposals will not bode well for the left in a general election matchup. Despite that, Sanders, who remains a top-tier candidate, is boldly running with his multitrillion-dollar, big government proposals and has garnered support from three individuals largely demonstrative of the ideological divide within the party: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ilhan Omar (D-MN). Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s infamous feud with Pelosi over the summer was almost a foreshadowing of the internal strife to be seen within the Democrat Party in the presidential primary. There is an ongoing, although largely unsaid, matchup between establishment Democrats and the unabashedly socialist \u201cnew\u201d left. Ultimately, the Democrat establishment worries the progressive flank will hand Trump, and his MAGA agenda, four more years in the White House.",

      "subtitle": "A Gallup poll that has tracked voter enthusiasm since 2000 shows Republicans with a small but noteworthy lead.",
      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " As of today, Republican enthusiasm sits at 65 percent, compared to 64 percent for Democrats. You might argue that a single point lead is meaningless. But here\u2019s the rub\u2026 It\u2019s not supposed to be like this. The party with the incumbent president is almost always running behind in voter enthusiasm. The reasons for this should be obvious: the other side is more juiced to win back the White House. Back in 2000, when Democrats were coming off two terms of Democrat Bill Clinton, the GOP had a 51 to 39 percent enthusiasm edge \u2014 12 points. In 2004, when Republican George W. Bush ran for reelection, Democrats had a 73 to 62 percent lead \u2014 11 points. In 2008, after two Bush terms, Democrats were up 73 to 59 percent \u2014 14 points. In 2012, as Democrat Barack Obama sought his second term, Republicans were up 70 to 59 \u2014 11 points. In 2016, after two Obama terms, the GOP was up 51 to 43 \u2014 8 points. In every case since 2000, the party out of power did not just enjoy a lead in enthusiasm, with the exception of 2016; it enjoyed a double-digit lead. But here we are going into 2020, and the party in power, the GOP, is not only plenty enthusiastic; it is in the lead. What\u2019s more, we are seeing a big jump since the 2018 midterms, a jump from 51 to 66 for the Republicans and a jump from 48 to 65 percent for Democrats. So what\u2019s different this time? A number of things\u2026 Unlike Bush Jr., Trump is determined to hold on to his base. Clinton and Obama governed this way. Bush did not, and the results of that, during his second term (Katrina plus immigration reform), were catastrophic. Trump has wisely embraced the Clinton/Obama game plan that says you always dance with them that brung ya. Secondly, of course, is this absurd and outrageous impeachment, which is being exposed every day as a full-blown Deep State-Media-Democrat coup, a straight-up conspiracy, and this is almost certainly creating a rallying effect around Trump. Finally, the Democrat presidential field is in every way terrible. Former Vice President Joe Biden is too old, represents the past, and not very bright. Elizabeth Warren is a non-starter with her pledge to strip 160 million Americans of their private health insurance as she more than doubles the federal budget with her $52 trillion \u2014 with a \u201cT\u201d \u2014 Medicare for All fiasco. Bernie Sanders is a 198-year-old commie with a bum ticker. There is no Barack Obama in this field. There is no Ronald Reagan. There is no Bill Clinton. There is no Donald Trump. There is no superstar who screams This Is the Future \u2014\u00a0just a bunch of old socialists. Alphas win presidential elections, and there is not an alpha in the bunch. On paper, and until she opens her mouth, Kamala Harris looks every inch the superstar. But she flamed out as soon as the spotlight revealed her crippling flaws and lack of intelligence. A word of caution: we don\u2019t know what this poll will look like a year from now. Nevertheless, it is more than noteworthy now, and it is difficult to imagine a scenario, other than a deep recession, that changes these numbers. But with most economic indicators on the upswing, a recession seems less likely than it did three months ago when the media were literally begging for a recession. In fact, it is much easier to game out scenarios where enthusiasm for Trump actually increases, especially if Democrats jump off that cliff and vote to impeach. This impeachment process is such an outrageous and infuriating abuse of power, so obscenely anti-democratic, and Trump will continue to be effective at communicating that point. It is also worth pointing out that this enthusiasm poll did not predict the outcome of the 2004 and 2012 elections. Democrats had an 11-point lead in \u201904, and Democrat John Kerry still lost to Bush. Republicans also had an 11-point lead in 2012, and Republican Mitt Romney still lost to Obama. But this might also reveal a couple of things in Trump\u2019s favor:\u00a0 1) it is difficult to knock out an incumbent president and 2) candidates matter. Kerry and Romney were terrible candidates, unappealing elitists backed by terrible campaigns. Trump, on the other hand, is a terrific campaigner, and from the looks of it, his Democrat opponent will be another Romney or Kerry. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " \u201cI am angry and I own it,\u201d Warren declared in an email blast on Friday. However, her response was not geared toward her GOP foe, President Trump. Rather, it was a response to the recent remarks, primarily, from Biden. The back and forth began following the rollout of Warren\u2019s $52 trillion Medicare for All plan. Biden\u2019s campaign immediately shredded what it called the \u201cmathematical gymnastics\u201d used in the proposal. Warren responded to the critique, calling out Biden by name and suggesting that he was using \u201cRepublican talking points.\u201d \u201cDemocrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies who don\u2019t want to see any change in the law that will bite into their profits,\u201d she told reporters:  Biden responded in a Medium post on Tuesday, defending his record of fighting for the Democrat Party. \u201cThe other day I was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary. Pretty amazing. On one level, it is kind of funny,\u201d he began, addressing Warren without mentioning her name: But at another level these kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn\u2019t agree with you \u2014 it\u2019s not just that you disagree \u2014 that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker. Warren hit back on Friday, subtly attributing his response to sexism. \u201cOver and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,\u201d Warren\u2019s email read. The former vice president denied the implication during an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on Friday. \u201cThe strong women in my life are angry \u2014 they get angry about things. That has nothing to do with it,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt had nothing to do with that,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt had to do with the fact that it started off and she said, you know, Biden is running in the wrong primary because I disagreed, disagree with her Medicare for All proposal.\u201d",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " In rare form, Warren, who has embraced and tweaked many of the positions long held by Vermont\u2019s socialist senator, expressed a vastly different position than her ideological similar, telling Democracy Now!\u2019s Amy Goodman that she does not agree with Sanders\u2019 view that billionaires \u201cshould not exist.\u201d \u201cIf somebody has a great idea and they followed through and they work hard and they built something, then good for them,\u201d Warren said, adding that they should pay a wealth tax to help others have the same opportunity:   It is a similar answer Warren has issued on the campaign trail. She has contended that she does not have an issue with billionaires, despite targeting them in the past \u2014 specifically, in her wealth tax plan and her \u201ccalculator for billionaires.\u201d \u201cLook I don\u2019t have a beef with billionaires,\u201d Warren said during the last Democrat debate. \u201cMy problem is, you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you. But you built that fortune in America \u2014 I guarantee \u2014 you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate,\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou built it in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part by protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for,\u201d she continued. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, you make it to the top of one-tenth of one percent, then pitch in the two cents so every other kid in America has the chance,\u201d she added. Despite her difference in opinion on a billionaire\u2019s right to exist as a billionaire, both Sanders and Warren have proposed wealth taxes as central points of their platforms. As Breitbart News detailed: Warren\u2019s \u201cUltra-Millionaire Tax\u201d\u00a0targets\u00a0individuals with more than $50 million in assets, levying a two percent tax, which goes up to three percent for those with more than $1 billion in assets. However, her $52 trillion Medicare for All plan increases the taxes on the ultra-wealthy, \u201casking billionaires to pitch in six cents on each dollar of net worth above $1 billion.\u201d Hillary Clinton, who has been teasing a potential last-minute 2020 bid, expressed doubt over Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 wealth tax proposals. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how that could work, and I don\u2019t see other examples anywhere else in the world where it has actually worked over a long period of time,\u201d Clinton\u00a0said at the\u00a0New York Times\u2019 DealBook conference this week. \u201cBut assume you can get some system of evaluation, people would literally have to sell assets to pay the tax on the assets that they owned before the wealth tax was levied,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat would be incredibly disruptive, so I think there are other ways to raise the revenues,\u201d she added.",

      "subtitle": "South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the candidate most hated by his rivals for the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, according to a profile Saturday by the\u00a0New York Times.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " The\u00a0Times reports\u00a0that other candidates resent Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cknow-it-all\u201d attitude, given his experience \u2014 and are jealous of his star power and fundraising prowess. In the still-crowded Democratic presidential field, one man has triggered an outpouring of resentment and angst. It\u2019s not Donald Trump. As Mr. Buttigieg, the millennial mayor of a town smaller than a New York City Council district, rises in the polls, he has struck a nerve with his Democratic rivals. Many of their campaigns have griped privately about the attention and cash directed toward Mr. Buttigieg. They say he is too inexperienced to be electable and that his accomplishments don\u2019t merit the outsize appeal he has with elite donors and voters. His public punditry about the race has prompted eye rolls from older rivals who view him as a know-it-all. And in a field where most candidates find themselves strapped for cash, they snipe at his ability to raise more than anyone else in the primary field except for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The\u00a0Times notes that Buttigieg irritated fellow candidates recently when he described the campaign as a two-way race between himself and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Other nuggets: former Vice President Joe Biden once greeted Buttigieg, sarcastically, as \u201cMr. President.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said that if other candidates had run with as little experience as Buttigieg, \u201cI don\u2019t think people would take us seriously.\u201d Warren said Buttigieg was running a \u201cconsultant-driven campaign\u201d; Former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said he Buttigieg did not appeal to minorities; Gov. Steve Bullock of Minnesota noted that Buttigieg had only won \u201c9,000 votes in a college town [South Bend] that last voted for a Republican in 1964.\u201d And as other reports have noted, Buttigieg is considered too mainstream for some radical LGBT activists. Buttigieg\u2019s rise has been unusual, and rapid. He graduated from Harvard, won a Rhodes scholarship, and worked as a management consultant for McKinsey. Inspired by his work for Barack Obama\u2019s campaign in Iowa in 2008, he joined the U.S. Navy Reserve. He ran for state treasurer in Indiana, and lost. He won the race for mayor in South Bend, and deployed to Afghanistan while serving his first term (unlike rival Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), who resigned from a city council seat when she was called up for duty in Iraq). He came out as gay relatively recently. He was re-elected mayor and ran for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, buoyed by support from Silicon Valley donors, but lost to former Labor Secretary Tom Perez. He is the first openly gay presidential candidate, a fact that has boosted his profile and fundraising, even though he has said that he is not running \u201cto be president of gay America.\u201d Buttigieg is very sharp, but his style is sometimes perceived as condescending. One repeated criticism from the right is that he likes to lecture conservatives on their supposed lack of Christian principles for failing to support government policies like a minimum wage, for example. He has also contrived a fight with Vice President Mike Pence, accusing him of being a religious extremist, though Pence has a long record of treating him respectfully. Support for Buttigieg has surged in Iowa, as he attempts to repeat Obama\u2019s strategy of shocking more established rivals in the caucuses there, and using that momentum to win elsewhere, even though his national polls remain somewhat low. The\u00a0Times notes that Buttigieg has been able to set up field offices in early primary states, making him a competitive candidate. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

By far\u201d:  He continued, noting that Warren actually qualifies as a \u201cone-percenter\u201d herself. \u201cAccording to her filings she made 900k last year which means her family earns more than 2x the amount needed to be a 1 percenter,\u201d Cuban stated. \u201cShe paid 25.5% of that in taxes which is less than the % I paid in taxes (29.85%).\u201d \u201cForbes says her networth is north of $12m,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s being rich.

Is it realistic to think any of it will pass let alone all of it?\u201d he asked:  Cuban said the presidential hopeful is \u201cprobably is the smartest of all the candidates,\u201d which means \u201cintellectually she knows she is misleading the public,\u201d particularly when it comes to her Medicare for All proposal:  \u201cI\u2019m fine with paying more taxes. I\u2019ve said it for years on http://blogmaverick.com,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cBut the Senator is like every other candidate. She is selling shiny objects to divert attention from reality,\u201d he added, taking a dig at President Trump:  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Warren\u2019s ideological similar who has also made a point to decry the ultra-wealthy, is also a millionaire. He has a \u201c$2.5 million fortune,\u201d according to Forbes.",

VA hospitals have gone without needed updates and maintenance, and outpatient clinics and Vet Centers have gone unopened,\u201d Sanders\u2019 plan states. \u201cAs President, Bernie will invest at least $62 billion in the infrastructure needed to provide the cutting-edge health care services our veterans have earned and deserve,\u201d it continues. A good portion of Sanders\u2019 plan is devoted to guaranteeing quality health care for veterans, which he believes Medicare for All will enhance. \u201cCoupled with Medicare for All, veterans will be able to rely on a health care system that is working for them, not against them; a system focused on a person\u2019s health, not their ability to pay,\u201d his plan states. Part of that quality medical care, Sanders assesses, should include the ability to undergo taxpayer-funded \u201cmedically necessary gender affirmation surgeries\u201d and receive what he calls \u201cabortion care.\u201d As president, Sanders would \u201cend the VA\u2019s blanket exclusion on medically necessary gender-affirmation surgeries\u201d and\u00a0 \u201censure that women veterans will no longer be forced outside the VA system for basic women\u2019s health services, including fertility treatment, abortion care, or specialized cancer treatment and prevention services.\u201d Sanders is not the only presidential candidate to focus on taxpayer-funded \u201ctransition-related\u201d surgeries as part of his VA plan.

      "author": "David Ng",
      "content": " While Apatow is worried that candidates who are baby boomers or older might not have the mental stamina to serve as an effect commander-in-chief, Behar argued that age shouldn\u2019t be an issue in the election. Their on-air spat comes as politicians in their 70s are dominating the Democratic field of presidential hopefuls. The party\u2019s two frontrunners, Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA,) are 76 and 70, respectively. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is 78. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is 77, though he hasn\u2019t officially announced his candidacy.  \u201cI do worry about a very old president,\u201d Apatow said on Tuesday\u2019s show. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want a president that doesn\u2019t have the energy. I\u2019m 51. I still can\u2019t find the fork in the drawer half the time. You know, I\u2019m already goofy. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to be like at 80.\u201d Behar, 76, took objection to Apatow\u2019s comments, noting that she\u2019s the same age as Sen. Biden. \u201cI total disagree with that. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m the sage age as Joe Biden. Do I look like I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing?\u201d She added: \u201cI don\u2019t see it as an issue. I really don\u2019t.\u201d Apatow replied: \u201cYou\u2019re like a genetic mutation.\u201d The 40-Year-Old Virgin director has been a vehement critic of President Donald Trump, calling him a \u201csniveling lunatic\u201d and a \u201cNazi supported by the Russians.\u201d Behar recently came under fire after she lost her cool when Donald Trump, Jr. appeared on The View last week and noted that Behar once dressed in blackface. The host denied on air that she has ever donned blackface, despite previously admitting that she once dressed as a \u201cbeautiful African woman\u201d for Halloween.

      "subtitle": "Former Vice President Joe Biden inaccurately claimed on Monday his top rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), started the war of words that has escalated between the two camps over Medicare for All.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Biden, who is one of the only 2020 Democrats to come out in opposition to the universal health care proposal, was asked during a televised CNN town hall in Iowa about criticisms he made regarding Warren\u2019s \u201celitist\u201d brand of politics. The former vice president made the remarks last week in a self-published Medium piece after Warren suggested he was running in the wrong presidential primary because he was unwilling to support Medicare for All. \u201cLet\u2019s get something straight, she attacked me,\u201d Biden said when asked about the dust up. \u201cShe went out and said\u2026Biden is a coward, Biden is\u2026and she went down the list of saying I should be in a Republican primary. What do you call that?\u201d The former vice president defended his decision to write the Medium piece, saying there was an \u201cattitude that exists\u201d in the country right now that \u201cif you disagree with me, you must be bad.\u201d Despite the pleas for civility and understanding, Biden proceeded to lambast Warren\u2019s views and attitude as \u201celitist\u201d and condescending once more. Although the moderator, CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, attempted to push back against Biden\u2019s comments, what ended up being lost in the mix was that the former vice president had started the altercation over Medicare for All. Earlier this month, Biden accused Warren of lying about the true costs of Medicare for All and how she would pay for it during an interview with \u201cPBS News Hour.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s making it up,\u201d the former vice president said when asked about cost estimates Warren\u2019s campaign had released on the proposal. \u201cLook, nobody thinks it\u2019s $20 trillion. It\u2019s between 30 and $40 trillion. Every major independent study that\u2019s gone out there, that\u2019s taken a look at this, there is no way \u2014 even [Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)], who talks about the need to raise middle-class taxes, he can\u2019t even meet the cost of it.\u201d Even prior to the interview, Biden\u2019s campaign had been pressuring Warren for months to explain how she would cover the costs associated from Medicare for All, which some estimate could run upwards of $32 trillion, without raising taxes on the middle class. When the Massachusetts Democrats did finally answer that question with a detailed proposal, Biden\u2019s campaign jumped to claim she was promising to raise taxes on middle class families, even though Warren expressly pledged in her plan there would be \u201cno middle class tax increases.\u201d \u201cFor months, Elizabeth Warren has refused to say if her health care plan would raise taxes on the middle class, and now we know why: because it does,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, the former vice president\u2019s deputy campaign manger, said at the time.\u00a0\u201cSenator Warren would place a new tax of nearly $9 trillion that will fall on American workers.\u201d Warren, herself, responded to the attack while campaigning in Iowa by accusing the former vice president of \u201crepeating Republican talking points\u201d on Medicare for All to the benefit of insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry. \u201cIf anyone wants to defend keeping those high profits for insurance companies\u2026drug companies\u2026and not making corporations pay a fair share in taxes,\u201d the senator said, \u201cthen I think they\u2019re running in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d Warren, in part, was echoing her progressive rival from Vermont, Sanders, with the attack. In July, Sanders had publicly accused Biden of parroting\u00a0GOP talking points in an effort to undermine the credibility of Medicare for All. \u201cObviously what Biden was doing\u00a0is what the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industries, Republicans, do: ignoring the fact that people will save money on their health care because they will no longer have to pay premiums or out-of-pocket expenses,\u201d\u00a0Sanders, who authored the initial Medicare for Al bill in 2017, told The New York Times over the summer. Regardless if the rebuke had partially been used before, Warren\u2019s suggestion that Biden should be running as a Republican sent the former vice president\u2019s team spinning. Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, even\u00a0claimed Warren has no right to question his Democrat credentials since she herself was a Republican until the age of 47-years-old.  When that attack failed to get traction, Biden penned his Medium piece, accusing Warren of brandishing an \u201celitist\u201d and \u201ccondescending\u201d brand of politics that was eroding the national discourse. Although the former vice president never once mentioned Warren in the piece, his rigorous defense of expanding the Affordable Care Act through a public option left little to the imagination. The flare-up between the two camps underscores the precarious position Biden finds himself in three months away from the first nominating contest in Iowa. Although the former vice president started the race as the clear frontrunner, leading the field by as much as\u00a032 percentage points\u00a0at one point, his campaign has steadily declined in recent months. Biden\u2019s decreasing political fortunes have comes as Warren\u2019s have\u00a0only increased. The Massachusetts Democrat has leapfrogged Biden in the early primary and caucus states. One recent poll out of Iowa showed Warren leading the field with 28 percent support among Democrats, while Biden was\u00a0relegated\u00a0to fourth place\u00a0with only 12 percent. A similar situation has played out nationally, by which most polls show Warren leading Biden, albeit with a narrow margin. As the candidates standing in the 2020 field has reversed, with Warren being described as the frontrunner by even some of Biden\u2019s former Obama administration colleagues, the former vice president has only escalated his criticism, as exhibited at the CNN town hall on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m more of a Democrat from my shoe sole to my ears than about anybody running in this party,\u201d Biden claimed, before clarifying that also included Warren.",

The beef between the two escalated after Warren unveiled her $52 trillion Medicare for All plan \u2014 a plan which she claims will not require a middle class tax hike. Biden\u2019s Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield remarked on the \u201cmathematical gymnastics\u201d used in Warren\u2019s proposal, and the Massachusetts senator suggested that Biden was guilty of using \u201cRepublican talking points.\u201d \u201cDemocrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies who don\u2019t want to see any change in the law that will bite into their profits,\u201d she said. Biden\u00a0defended\u00a0his position in a Medium post last week, noting that Warren\u2019s attack reflects \u201can angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics,\u201d although he did not mention her by name. \u201cThe other day I was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary. Pretty amazing. On one level, it is kind of funny,\u201d he wrote. He continued: But at another level these kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn\u2019t agree with you \u2014 it\u2019s not just that you disagree \u2014 that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.

It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,\u201d it continued. The former vice president\u00a0denied\u00a0his critique had anything to do with sexism and doubled down on his remarks during CNN\u2019s town hall Monday evening. \u201cThe attitude is elitist that people can\u2019t make up their own mind,\u201d Biden said, alluding to her position on Medicare for All. \u201cIt\u2019s not about her, it\u2019s about the attitude out there \u2014 the attitude that we know best, you do it my way,\u201d he continued, arguing that he was not talking about her per se. \u201cI resent that.

      "content": " Buttigieg has been slowly working his way up in national and early-state polls in recent weeks. He made waves last month after jumping to third place in Iowa, as a Suffolk University/USA Today poll showed. The Monmouth University poll, taken\u00a0November 7 to 11, 2019, among 451 likely Democrat caucus-goers in Iowa, found Buttigieg leading the pack with 22 percent support. The former vice president came in second place with 19 percent support, causing Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to drop to third and fourth place with 18 percent and 13 percent, respectively. While Warren\u2019s drop to third may seem significant, it is only a two percent drop from the 20 percent support she saw in Monmouth\u2019s previous poll. No other candidate came close to the top four. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered five percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Tom Steyer (D), and Andrew Yang (D), all of whom saw three percent support each. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent, signaling a tight race among the top three \u2014 Buttigieg, Biden, and Warren:  According to Monmouth, Buttigieg \u201chas gained ground among every major demographic group since the summer.\u201d Per Monmouth: His support stands at 26% among voters who describe themselves as moderate or conservative, 23% among those who are somewhat liberal, and 15% among those who are very liberal. He is currently in the top tier for both women (24%, to 22% for Biden, and 20% for Warren), and men (20%, to 19% for Sanders and 16% for Warren).\u00a0 Looking at the poll results by age, Buttigieg (26%) is nipping at Biden\u2019s heels (29%) among voters age 65 and older. He has a slight advantage among those age 50 to 64 (24%, to 17% each for Biden and Warren), and is competitive among voters under the age of 50 (19%, to 24% for Warren and 19% for Sanders).\u00a0 Buttigieg leads among college graduates (24%, to 21% for Warren and 15% for Biden) and is in the top tier among those without a college degree (21%, to 21% for Biden, 18% for Sanders, and 16% for Warren). \u201cButtigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats,\u201d\u00a0Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray\u00a0said, noting that the presidential hopeful\u2019s support cannot be attributed to any one group. \u201cWhile he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucusgoers, you really can\u2019t pigeonhole his support to one particular group,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology.\u201d Additionally, Buttigieg is enjoying the highest favorability in the crowded field, with a 73 percent favorability rating from likely Democrat caucus-goers. Warren follows with 69 percent, followed by Biden with 65 percent and Sanders with 61 percent.",

      "content": " Warren has made billionaires her target in recent weeks, arguing in favor of a \u201cwealth tax.\u201d She claims it could fund universal childcare, free college, the cancellation of student debt, and \u201cmuch more,\u201d as detailed by her latest campaign ad, which demonizes billionaires. Her proposal, dubbed the \u201cUltra-Millionaire Tax,\u201d\u00a0imposes\u00a0a two percent tax on individuals with over $50 million in assets. It goes up to three percent for those with more than $1 billion in assets, although Warren has floated raising the percentage on billionaires, asking them to \u201cpitch in six cents on each dollar of net worth above $1 billion\u201d to help fund her $52 trillion Medicare for All plan. While she has not taken her rhetoric as far as her ideological similar Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who said that billionaires \u201cshould not exist,\u201d she has upped her target of the group in recent weeks. Her campaign recently rolled out $25 \u201cBillionaire Tears\u201d mugs, cheekily urging supporters to \u201csavor a warm, slightly salty beverage of your choice in this union-made mug as you contemplate all the good a wealth tax could do\u201d:  The description reads: In November 2019, billionaire and former Goldman Sachs executive Leon Cooperman (who as recently as 2017 settled with the SEC on insider-trading charges) was brought to tears on live television while discussing the prospect that a President Elizabeth Warren might require him to pay his fair share in taxes. Savor a warm, slightly salty beverage of your choice in this union-made mug as you contemplate all the good a wealth tax could do: universal childcare, student debt cancellation, universal free college, and more. Twitter users took the opportunity to mock Warren. \u201cI see you\u2019re using capitalism to your advantage,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cI fixed it for you: \u2018Billionaire Tears Of Joy,\u2019\u201d another remarked. \u201cBillionaires are so afraid of Warren they send her money,\u201d another added. As Breitbart News reported, Warren has, in fact, received contributions from at least 30 billionaires over the course of her political career: Warren prides her presidential bid as a 100 percent grassroots-funded campaign. While she has raised millions \u2014 an impressive\u00a0$24.6 million in the third quarter \u2014 she reportedly\u00a0used\u00a0$10.4 million in leftover funds from her 2018 senatorial bid to cushion her current campaign. During the course of her senatorial campaign, Warren happily attended fundraisers and accepted money from big donors, sparking questions surrounding her newfound commitment to keep big donors out of politics. The\u00a0New York Post\u00a0analyzed\u00a0Warren\u2019s past campaign contributions and found that she has accepted donations from at least 30 billionaires throughout her political tenure. Those included donations from\u00a0venture capitalist\u00a0Christopher Sacca; GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner\u2019s wife, Theresa; and Susan Pritzker, \u201cwife of Hyatt heir Nicholas Pritzker II,\u201d as the New York Post reported. Warren, while not a billionaire, is wealthy herself. She has a \u201c$12 million fortune,\u201d according to Forbes.",

      "author": "Lucas Nolan",
      "content": " Business Insider reports that following recent allegations of gender bias, lawmakers are calling on Goldman Sachs to reveal the algorithm it uses to determine credit limits for its new Apple Card. The issue started on Thursday after entrepreneur\u00a0David Heinemeier Hansson claimed that the Apple Card gave him 20 times the credit limit his wife received. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has stated that his wife experienced similar results. The Apple Card was launched in partnership with Goldman Sachs which has claimed that applicants were evaluated independently according to income and creditworthiness, with factors such as personal credit scores and personal debt taken into account. The bank stated that it was possible for two family members to receive very different credit decisions but added: \u201cWe have not, and will not, make decisions based on factors like gender.\u201d Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren criticized Goldman Sachs in an interview with Bloomberg recently, stating:\u00a0\u201cYeah, great, so let\u2019s just tell every woman in America, \u2018You might have been discriminated against, on an unknown algorithm, it\u2019s on you to telephone Goldman Sachs and tell them to straighten it out. Sorry, guys, that\u2019s not how it works.\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) also tweeted that he would be investigating the allegations surrounding the Apple card, stating: \u201cI\u2019m investigating whether these allegations are true. If they are, I expect Apple and Goldman Sachs to do everything in their power to put an end to discrimination.\u201d  Breitbart News financial editor John Carney wrote an article about this issue recently, stating that it was unlikely that Apple or Goldman Sachs were discriminating based on gender. Carney wrote: I hate to be the one who tells you this but Apple and Goldman do not care about you. They do not care about your hopes, your dreams, your philosophy, your politics, or your gender. They\u2019ll use whatever pronouns you ask them to. We are all just future income streams to them. That\u2019s it. Dollars divided by time. A discount rate, a probability of default, and a regulatory capital charge. Neither company has a particular interest in rationing credit, apart from some attempt to estimate the maximum credit they can provide and still get paid back at an acceptable rate. They do not really care if you, as an individual, wind up paying them back. They just want to get paid back at a rate that means making short-term consumer loans is slightly profitable enough to cover their cost of capital. They are constrained by regulations that penalize them for supplying what the government sees as too much credit to people whose lives might be ruined by over-indulgence in borrowing. Those include a myriad of rules from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, capital regulation from the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and state laws on credit. Think about it this way. If there were a team at Goldman Sachs who developed a computer program that gave too little credit to women, what are the odds that another team at Goldman wouldn\u2019t have figured out how to make more money by providing the appropriate level of credit? Is everyone there too sexist to want to make money by lending appropriately to women customers? Read the\u00a0full article here.

      "subtitle": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Friday released her plan to transition the United States to her $52 trillion Medicare for All program, notably holding off on ending private insurance right off the bat and making it part of her second legislative push, which she claims will occur before the end of her first term.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren unveiled her Medicare for All plan in a Medium post this month, proclaiming, proudly, that the multitrillion-dollar plan would not require a tax hike on middle class Americans, even though experts state that it would. Rather, Warren claims she will pay for the plan, in part, via an additional tax hike on the wealthy, cuts on defense spending, and amnesty. The presidential hopeful added to her plan on Friday, explaining how she would transition the country to a Medicare for All system. While she claims the transition would occur entirely in her first term, its enactment would occur under two legislative pushes. She describes the first as a \u201cfast-track budget reconciliation legislation to create a true Medicare for All option that\u2019s free for tens of millions\u201d:  Her plan states: Coverage under the new Medicare for All option will be immediately free for children under the age of 18 and for families making at or below 200% of the federal poverty level (about $51,000 for a family of four). For all others, the cost will be modest, and eventually, coverage under this plan will be free for everyone. Then, \u201cno later\u201d than her third year in office, Warren would \u201cfight to pass legislation that would complete the transition to full Medicare for All,\u201d essentially eliminating the need for private insurance: By this point, the American people will have experienced the full benefits of a true Medicare for All option, and they can see for themselves how that experience stacks up against high-priced care that requires them to fight tooth-and-nail against their insurance company. Per the terms of the Medicare for All Act, supplemental private insurance that doesn\u2019t duplicate the benefits of Medicare for All would still be available. But by avoiding duplicative insurance and integrating every American into the new program, the American people would save trillions of dollars on health costs. Warren believes that the methodical, step by step approach will result in \u201cmillions\u201d of Americans paying less in health care and claims they will see the \u201cquality of their current health coverage improve.\u201d \u201cAnd millions more Americans will have the choice to ditch their private insurance and enter a high-quality public plan,\u201d her plan states, reiterating that it will not result in an increased tax burden for middle class families. \u201cAnd, at each step, the changes in our health care system will be fully paid for without raising taxes one penny on middle class families,\u201d her plan claims. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves: every Democratic plan for expanding public health care coverage is a challenge to these industries\u2019 bottom lines \u2013 and every one of these plans is already being drowned in money to make sure it never happens,\u201d Warren wrote, adding in a jab to two of her fiercest Democrat critics, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D). \u201cAny candidate who believes more modest reforms will avoid the wrath of industry is not paying attention,\u201d she warned. Warren confirmed at a town hall meeting in Raleigh, North Carolina, this month that her Medicare for All plan will also cover illegal immigrants. \u201cMedicare for All, as I put this together, covers everyone, regardless of immigration status, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Warren told the crowd: ",

Pressley veered from her colleagues, throwing her weight behind Warren, who has also proposed ultra-far left proposals, including Medicare for All and an \u201cUltra-Millionaire\u201d tax. Obama continued, according to the Times: I don\u2019t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven\u2019t heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that\u2019s going to activate them. \u201cFor those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you I had a very robust primary,\u201d Obama added. \u201cI\u2019m confident that at the end of the process we will have a candidate that has been tested.\u201d Obama has yet to throw his support behind any of the current Democrat candidates, including his former running mate and vice president Joe Biden (D). Obama ally Deval Patrick (D), former governor of Massachusetts, recently jumped into the race \u00ad\u2013 a move Breitbart News\u2019s John Nolte described as a slap in the face to Biden: Well, Patrick and Obama\u00a0are close. In fact, Obama tried to talk Patrick into running last year, but was turned down. Patrick feared the ugliness of the race, his wife was ill, and he was probably thrilled to be making a pile of money giving women cancer. But Patrick is getting in now, isn\u2019t he? And it is more than fair to assume he\u2019s getting in because Obama begged him to. The reasons are obvious\u2026 As is being reported everywhere, the smoke-filled-room fellas, the leaders of the Democrat Party, the money men, the Obamas, etc., are terrified of Warren\u2019s socialistic tendencies, know Buttigieg is too young and too gay\u2026 But most of all they know Old Joe Biden just doesn\u2019t have the stuff. To be fair, Slow Joe never had the stuff. He\u2019s always been a terrible presidential candidate, and there are reports Obama tried to discourage him from running. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, another major Obama figure, is also reportedly considering a longshot presidential bid, further adding to the growing belief that establishment Democrats \u2013\u00a0Obama and Hillary Clinton included \u2013\u00a0are increasingly worried by what the current Democrat field has to offer.",

Modine\u2019s remark encompasses the growing frustration among many Democrats \u2014 Democrats who are not excited about Biden or confident in his ability to go head-to-head with President Trump in a general election matchup. The sentiment has been reflected in recent polls, showing Biden, who was once believed to be the secure, almost unbeatable frontrunner, slowly slipping into political oblivion. A George Washington University Politics Poll released last month showed Biden dropping to third place, behind both Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sanders. An Iowa poll released later in the month showed Biden flopping to fourth place in the Hawkeye State, behind Warren, Sanders, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has experienced a significant surge in the state in recent weeks. The most recent Economist/YouGov poll\u00a0shows Biden trailing Warren with 23 percent to Warren\u2019s 26 percent, while the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows the former vice president losing his once-held definitive lead, tying with Sanders with 19 percent support.   The Biden campaign\u2019s cash flow also speaks to the presidential hopeful\u2019s festering issues. His campaign only managed to raise $15.2 million in the third quarter \u2014 a number that paled in comparison to the $25.3 million raised by Sanders and $24.6 million touted by Warren \u2014 and reported just $9 million cash on hand. \u201cHis rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand,\u201d as Breitbart News noted.",

As much as I\u2019d like to reduce the involvement of insurers, banning them under a Medicare for All system is not the solution. This would only insert the government where insurers currently exist. The rationing, wait lists and tax increases associated with Medicare for All would not be worth any potential gains from turning the health care system into the Department of Motor Vehicles. We\u2019ve already seen how a similar system has led to preventable harm and death for our military veterans. A better solution would empower patients to pay for health care costs directly.

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " America First Policies, the president\u2019s official Super PAC, gave Breitbart News on Monday an exclusive sneak peek at findings from its focus group work nationwide in the last month. The organization has now conducted 18 separate focus groups in nine different American cities since late October. Those cities include Des Moines, Iowa, Orlando, Florida, Charlotte, North Carolina, Phoenix, Arizona, Miami, Florida, Atlanta, Georgia, Columbus, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. America First Policies has gathered 36 total hours of focus group data from the participants, all of whom are independents or swing voters in their respective cities. The biggest takeaway from all the groups, including one in Pittsburgh thatwas conducted after the first House Intelligence Committee public impeachment hearing last Wednesday that featured State Department officials Bill Taylor and George Kent, is that swing voters are not being moved in the slightest against Trump by the impeachment narrative Democrats are offering. America First Policies screened footage from these focus groups for Breitbart News at their headquarters\u00a0 just outside the nation\u2019s capital on Monday afternoon, including the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, group that was filmed after that first Democrat impeachment hearing. When the moderator asked the room if anyone thinks Donald Trump should be impeached, not a single person in the room\u2014all independents, most of whom do not like Trump\u2019s personality\u2014said they did. After a moment of silence when the focus group conductor asked the room of independents if Trump should be impeached, a man finally said: \u201cNot even close.\u201d The man continued when asked why the Democrats are pushing for impeachment: This is their platform. This is all they got\u2014and what they got is nothing. They want to keep to politics and Trump is not a politician. They are going to do everything they can because he bucked the system. He exposed what the draining the swamp and everything means. That\u2019s the thing\u2014they don\u2019t even have anything close to valid. It\u2019s just nothing. Instead of focusing on policies, they\u2019re trying to do this to win the election. When the moderator asks another man how House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has done handling the impeachment inquiry so far, he replies: \u201cI don\u2019t know because I can\u2019t believe half of what the media puts out because they\u2019re biased\u2014and there\u2019s been no proof on the table.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not all Trump\u2026 I\u2019m not a party voter,\u201d that man continues. \u201cBut he calls it like it is. He\u2019s a renegade\u2026 Do I respect the man? I don\u2019t. But I respect the office. But I don\u2019t see where they have enough to say he knew about it so\u2026\u201d Up next was a woman, who said she is not a Trump supporter but thinks the president is getting railroaded: I\u2019m not a Trump supporter by any means, but I totally disagree with what they\u2019re doing. I know he\u2019s not perfect, but by the same coin he\u2019s right there and he tells you how it is. I don\u2019t agree with all of the things. But at least he\u2019s trying to do things. After that another woman and another man\u2014both of whom are not Trump supporters\u2014made the case that Democrats\u2019 impeachment goals are meaningless because the Senate will clear Trump even if the House impeaches him. \u201cSadly, I don\u2019t feel\u2014just because they\u2019ll stick to party lines\u2014that this will go anywhere,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAnd they have to know that, so then you have to ask why they\u2019re doing this,\u201d the man added. \u201cCorrect,\u201d the woman concurred. \u201cIt\u2019s just a waste of the taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d Another man said he thinks the Democrats are doing it so Trump \u201chas an asterisk next to his name going into the next election.\u201d He went on: But another thing is I think it shows a weakness, or a lack of confidence, in the Democrat field and concern that their eventual candidate can\u2019t beat Donald Trump. Otherwise, why would you be doing this a year out from the election? This dismissal of impeachment was a consistent theme throughout the focus groups that America First Policies conducted throughout the country. Generally speaking, most of the focus groups\u2014video from all of which Breitbart News reviewed in America First\u2019s northern Virginia offices\u2014had no supporters of even the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. The handful of those that did support an actual inquiry\u2014because they want elected leaders like Trump to face scrutiny and they support investigations, not because they think he actually did anything wrong\u2014certainly do not think there is enough evidence to impeach, never mind convict Trump and remove him from office. A woman in the North Carolina focus group, for instance, said Democrats are \u201cwasting a lot of time and money\u201d pursuing Trump\u2019s impeachment and should instead \u201cget back to doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing, passing laws.\u201d A man in that group also summed up what independents are thinking, dismissing the Democrats\u2019 impeachment agenda: When the news of this first broke, I was sitting there thinking okay these are conversations that mostly went on and then you step back and look what they are\u2014from what media outlet\u2014and you go, okay, his personality is arrogant. We\u2019ve all seen him say something stupid. However, on the flip side of that, all this secrecy\u2014the smoke and mirrors\u2014the unwillingness to unmask the whistleblower out of fears of safety. Come on. What are you hiding? These sentiments on impeachment were not the only thing that America First\u2019s focus groups uncovered. Another consistent theme is that while these independent swing voters like President Trump\u2019s policies and what he\u2019s accomplished for the country, they do not like his personality or his tweets. Generally speaking, the swing voters wish Trump would tweet less attacks on opponents\u2014and not say certain things sometimes. But they did also reveal that while the voters find Trump\u2019s abrasive personality off-putting at times, they do like that he is a \u201cstreet fighter\u201d in the words of one and that he has exposed corruption in the federal government. Perhaps most importantly for Trump, the voters do not see him as part of the political system\u2014they do not consider Trump a \u201cpolitician,\u201d despite the fact he\u2019s been in office for nearly three years now\u2014and they still consider him an outsider or \u201crenegade,\u201d in the words of one Pittsburgh-area independent. What\u2019s more, America First\u2019s focus groups also uncovered a lot of sentiment among independents about several of the top Democrat presidential candidates. Regarding former Vice President Joe Biden, top terms focus group participants used were \u201ctoo old,\u201d \u201cforgetful,\u201d and \u201cObama\u2019s second hand.\u201d They also described Biden as a \u201ccreep\u201d who makes unwanted advances against young women and as \u201cthe swamp,\u201d a sign that America First Policies officials believe demonstrates that attacks on Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden are breaking through to voters nationwide. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is described as a \u201csocialist,\u201d \u201coutspoken,\u201d a \u201cliar,\u201d and \u201cacademic.\u201d Warren\u2019s history of falsely claiming to be a Native American has broken through, as several of the independent voters in the focus groups across the country called Warren \u201cPocahontas.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, meanwhile, was described as \u201ctoo old,\u201d \u201cangry,\u201d \u201ccrazy,\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d Another interesting finding from these focus groups is that these independent voters do not see much of a difference between any of the Democrats, even when there are actual policy-specific nuances separating them. For instance, when former Rep. Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) called for door-to-door gun confiscation and mandatory government-controlled buybacks of Americans\u2019 firearms before he later dropped out of the presidential race, one woman in a North Carolina focus group expressed outrage at the whole Democrat field over it. She said: \u201cI watched ten minutes of the Democratic debate and when I heard somebody talking about taking your guns I thought \u2018you just fucking killed yourself.\u2019 What was he talking about when he was saying he was going to take our guns?\u201d \u201cNo way in hell are they getting our guns,\u201d another woman said. The woman did not use the name \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke\u201d when expressing her frustrations with Democrats on gun confiscation, but just broadly spoke of all the Democrats like this. America First Policies officials told Breitbart News that generally speaking on issues like gun confiscation, illegal immigration, and healthcare\u2014particularly the backing of the government takeover of healthcare through \u201cMedicare For All\u201d\u2014these focus group voters do not see much nuance between the different Democrats\u2019 plans and policy visions, a problem for Democrats as swing voters are painting them all with a broad brush into radically leftist socialist positions. What\u2019s more, the only two Democrat candidates for president these focus group independent swing voters spoke highly of were Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and businessman Andrew Yang. The swing voters, the America First Policies officials told Breitbart News, like Gabbard\u2019s military service and the fight she just got in with 2016 Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. As for Yang, they said, the voters are intrigued by his different kinds of ideas like the universal basic income idea.",

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " The latest Pew Research Center survey finds that about six-in-ten moderate Democrat voters said they believe increased security along the United States-Mexico border is very or somewhat important \u2014 a policy that is opposed by leading 2020 Democrat presidential candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Among all Democrat and lean-Democrat voters, nearly half said they believe increased border and immigration controls are very or somewhat important \u2014 including nearly 40 percent of self-identified liberals. When it comes to deportations of illegal aliens, more than four-in-ten moderate Democrat voters said they support increasing the number of illegal aliens who are deported from the U.S. About 31 percent of all Democrat and lean-Democrat voters support increasing deportations. The findings are the latest instance where moderate and conservative Democrat voters have broken with 2020 Democrats\u2019 plans for opening the nation\u2019s borders to more illegal and legal immigration beyond the already historically high levels at which about 1.5 million foreign-born residents come to the U.S. every year. A New York Times/Siena College poll this month found that a majority of Biden\u2019s most conservative supporters want less immigration overall to the U.S. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of 54 percent of Biden voters who oppose Warren said they want legal immigration levels reduced. The Democrat Party\u2019s decades-long shift to support endless levels of immigration to the U.S. is primarily driven by white liberals who are plagued with \u201cwhite guilt\u201d and \u201cprivilege awareness,\u201d recent research has found. A July poll by\u00a0NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist showed that a plurality of moderate Democrats \u2014 47 percent \u2014 called providing free healthcare to all illegal aliens a \u201cbad idea.\u201d A majority of 56 percent of moderate voters said the same of the plan which has been endorsed by nearly all 2020 Democrat presidential candidates.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " A new CBS/YouGov survey released on Sunday confirmed as much, with the former vice president leading by nearly 30 percentage points in South Carolina.\u00a0Biden, who has led every single poll coming out of the Palmetto State since announcing his candidacy in April, commands 45 percent support among registered Democrats. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who ranks higher than Biden in several national and early state polls, garnered second place with 17 percent. Her position, however, is extremely tenuous as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is close behind in third place at 15 percent. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) rounded out the top five in South Carolina at eight percent and five percent respectively. Biden\u2019s positions seemed to strike a chord with those polled, 59 percent of whom self-identified as somewhat liberal or moderate. When asked to describe the candidates by their qualities, 60 percent of South Carolina Democrats claimed Biden was \u201csafe,\u201d while 55 percent said the former vice president was \u201cdown to earth.\u201d\u00a0A further 71 percent believed Biden\u2019s policy stances were \u201cabout right for defeating [President] Donald Trump\u201d in 2020. Warren, meanwhile, despite being described as the most exciting candidate of the top three, was also seen as \u201crisky\u201d by 40 percent of South Carolina. Likewise, 42 percent of voters in the Palmetto state said the same thing about Sanders, a self-avowed Democrat socialist. The poll, which was conducted November 6 through November 13 by surveying 933 registered Democrats in South Carolina, had a margin of error of +/- 4.2 percentage points. Biden\u2019s commanding position in South Carolina is due in part to his support within the black community. In South Carolina, as across the entire South, black voters are a substantial portion of the Democrat electorate. A recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from Monmouth Poll estimated that\u00a0more than six-in-ten of South Carolina\u2019s likely Democrat primary voters will be black in 2020. Although the CBS/YouGov did not break down the candidates\u2019 level of support by race, a poll conducted by Winthrop University in October found Biden being the favorite of 46 percent of black Democrats\u00a0across South Carolina. Such support, which has remained in tact even after contentious revelations about the former vice president\u2019s position on race throughout the years, gives Biden an upper hand over his Democrat rivals as the primary contest is in flux. In recent weeks the Democrat primary has been upended by several high profile developments. Biden, who once led the field by double digits, has dropped to fourth place in Iowa and been eclipsed nationally by Warren since the start of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. In particular, Biden has seen his popularity dip amid revelations that his youngest son Hunter\u2019s wheeling and dealing overseas may have presented conflicts of interest for the former vice president\u2019s political position. Biden\u2019s faltering in the polls has coincided with fundraising troubles\u00a0that forced his campaign into jettisoning its pledge not to accept help from Super PACs. As Biden\u2019s campaign has struggled to remain viable, Buttigieg\u2019s momentum has begun soaring in Iowa. Several polls released from the state last week show the mayor has catapulted over Biden, Sanders, and Warren into first place. A Des Moines Register poll from Saturday had Buttigieg leading Warren, 25 percent to 16 percent. The mayor\u2019s newfound frontrunner status in Iowa opens up the possibility of a fractured race coming out of the early contests, provided Warren continues leading in New Hampshire and Biden remains atop in South Carolina. Shaking up the race further is the addition of more candidates, at the time when historically the field is supposed to winnow. Most notably, former Gov. Deval Patrick (D-MA), an intimate of President Barack Obama, announced his candidacy last week after having declined earlier entreaties to enter the race. Patrick, despite lacking national name recognition and a campaign apparatus, is seen as a prolific orator, with even Obama being known to occasionally lift lines from the governor\u2019s speeches. Another likely late\u00a0entrant is former New York City Michael Bloomberg, who has promised to spend \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to win the nomination. Although Bloomberg is still officially just mulling a bid, the former mayor\u2019s decision to file for the Alabama and Arkansas Democrat primaries, as well as a public mea culpa for stop-and-frisk, seem to imply he\u2019s already running. As both Bloomberg and Patrick are seen as establishment-friendly Democrats, their decisions to enter the 2020 race are likely to have the most impact on Biden. The former vice president has been viewed as the moderate alternative to progressive firebrands like Sanders and Warren. His success in the race to date has been because other candidates in the same lane have neither the resources nor the national attention to properly compete. It is unclear, though, if either Bloomberg or Patrick will present a credible threat to Biden given the fractured state of the 2020 field and the former vice president\u2019s position in South Carolina. When respondents in the CBS/YouGov survey were asked if Bloomberg\u2019s potential candidacy would have any impact on those they were already supporting, 36 percent said it would not, while 43 percent said they didn\u2019t know enough about him to answer. Since Patrick was not an announced candidate at the time the poll was taken, CBS/YouGov did not include him on its survey.",

      "content": " Warren expressed her willingness to consider a UBI, which quite literally amounts to the government handing individuals and families a \u201cbasic\u201d income per month regardless of employment or income status, in a Washington Post survey that asked, \u201cShould the federal government pay a universal basic income to every American adult?\u201d Three candidates were listed as supporting the measure \u2013 Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Marianne Williamson (D), and Yang. Notably, two candidates were listed as \u201copen to it\u201d \u2013\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) and Warren. \u201cWe absolutely must raise wages and strengthen the social safety net so that every American has basic financial security. Universal basic income and universal living wages are options to consider,\u201d Warren told the Post, noting her push for a $15 minimum wage. She continued: To raise wages, I have pushed for a $15 minimum wage, stronger unions, and empowering American workers at big American corporations to elect no less than 40 percent of the company board members \u2014 giving workers a powerful voice in corporate decisions about wages and benefits. Her position is drastically different than Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-VT), who typically holds similar views to Warren. He has openly expressed skepticism of a universal basic income, contending that his federal jobs guarantee is better because \u201cpeople want to work.\u201d \u201cWe take a very different approach from Mr. Yang and that is I believe in a jobs guarantee,\u201d Sanders told Hill.TV in August. He continued: The challenge that we face is how do we use technology to improve the lives of working people. So if you have a really terrible job, a boring job and we make your job better and we enable you to work 20 hours a week rather than 40 hours a week, it\u2019s not a bad thing\u2026but it means to say you still need an income to live by, we can\u2019t cut your salaries in half.  He repeated that sentiment to the Post: Sanders believes that all Americans are entitled to economic rights. These include the right to a decent job with good pay, affordable housing, quality health care, a clean environment, and a secure retirement. We will guarantee a good-paying job to all Americans through a federal job guarantee program to ensure everyone has a decent quality of life. Furthermore, [Sanders] strongly supports the BOOST Act, introduced by Rep. [Rashida] Tlaib to guarantee all Americans an income. Yang, a strong proponent of the measure, addressed Sanders\u2019 critique. \u201cBernie ignores the facts that money in our hands would 1) create hundreds of thousands of local jobs and 2) recognize and reward the nurturing work being done in our homes and communities every day,\u201d he said. \u201cHe also assumes that everyone wants to work for the government, which isn\u2019t true,\u201d Yang continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange \u2013 he seemed open and warm to the idea of a Universal Basic Income not too long ago,\u201d he added. \u201cNow he seems irritated every time it comes up\u201d:  Yang has argued that a guaranteed income will \u201cAmericans will work even harder\u201d:  However, numerous studies and experiments have idicated that a UBI does not necessarily leave recipients better off. The Washington Post analyzed the experiment on the small scale, in which a non-profit gave \u201c20 African American single mothers living in public housing $1,000 each month for a year\u201d with no strings attached. While the women were able to buy necessities, they also spent money on nonessentials, with one woman noting that she \u201cblew all of it.\u201d Despite that, the Post did not necessarily deem the experiment a failure, blaming the lack of fruitful results on the participants\u2019 \u201clack of \u2018experience\u2019 in handling discretionary income,\u201d as Breitbart News reported.",

The survey, taken\u00a0November 13-18, 2019, among\u00a0255 likely Democratic primary voters, showed Buttigieg leading the pack with 25 percent support \u2013 a full ten points ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), both of whom garnered 15 percent support. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) came in fourth place with nine percent support. Due to the relatively small sampling, the margin of error is +/- 6.1 percent, although Buttigieg\u2019s lead is outside of statistical uncertainty. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) came in behind Sanders with six percent support, followed by billionaire Tom Steyer (D) with five percent support, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with three percent each. The remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who recently closed three offices in New Hampshire, is polling at just one percent in the Granite State:  The poll also showed that over three-fourths of Democrat voters, 77 percent, do not believe former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg should jump into the Democrat primary race. According to WMUR, \u201c62 percent would discourage former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick from running and 91 percent would discourage 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton from running again.\u201d The poll comes on the eve of the fifth Democrat primary debate in Atlanta, which will bring the top four contenders \u2013 Warren, Sanders, Biden, and Buttigieg \u2013 on the same stage once again.",

      "content": " For the first time, President Trump\u00a0is taking the lead ahead of four top Democrat candidates in potential head to head match-ups, according to a Wednesday poll conducted by\u00a0Marquette University Law School. According to the survey, only 40 percent of registered voters in\u00a0Wisconsin believe that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office. That percentage has dropped since last month, when 44 percent answered that the president should be impeached and removed. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how this story is going to end,\u201d said Marquette Poll director Charles Franklin. \u201cAt the moment just over half think there was an ask.\u201d It was also noted that in October \u2014 before the public\u00a0testimony began \u2014 the Marquette poll showed that among the respondents who said the president should be impeached, only 44 percent said that Trump should be removed from office, with 51 percent saying that he should not be removed. When it comes to the head to head match-ups, the president led former vice president Joe Biden by 47 percent to 44 percent (within the\u00a0margin of error), which turns the tables from August\u2019s survey results that\u00a0 showed Biden leading Trump by 51 percent to 42 percent. As for the other top Democrat candidates, Trump led Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders (D-VT) by 48 percent to 45 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) by\u00a048 percent to 43 percent, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg by 47 percent to 39 percent. \u201cCall it a small advantage to Trump,\u201d said Franklin. The survey also revealed that 52 percent of respondents believe President Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate his political rival, with 29 percent answering that he did not. Among those polled, 41 percent also said that they think President Trump withheld military aid to pressure\u00a0Zelensky, with 38 percent saying he did not. With regards to whether or not the president\u2019s alleged behavior had been erroneous, 42 percent thought President Trump did something seriously wrong, nine percent thought he did something wrong, and 38 percent believe that the president did not do something wrong. The poll was reportedly conducted using answers from 801 registered Wisconsin voters, and was taken through November 13 to 17, with the margin of error for the full sample being plus or minus 4.1 percent.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " \u201cI\u2019m leaving the fifth Democratic debate now,\u201d the former vice president wrote supporters. \u201cI hope I made you proud out there and I hope I made it clear to the world why our campaign is so important.\u201d Biden proceeds in the rest of the email to highlight his \u201cability to reach across the aisle,\u201d before ultimately ending with an appeal for political contributions for his campaign. Some members of the media, like Jess Bidgood of The Boston Globe, speculated that Biden\u2019s appeal to bipartisanship in the email may indicate he plans to focus his attacks on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) during Wednesday\u2019s debate.  Warren, until the recent rise of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, has been seen as Biden\u2019s biggest rival for the Democrat nomination. As such, the two have sparred openly over the direction of the Democrat Party. Biden, who claims to be the only Democrat able to win back the white working class in 2020, is campaigning as something of a moderate who will bring forth incremental change. The strategy is evident in the former vice president\u2019s policy platform, which is full of ideas that were seen as too radical during the Obama years but are now considered tepid when compared to those advocated by progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Warren, on the other hand, is a proponent of radical change, as exhibited by her endorsements of a wealth tax and the Green New Deal. The differences between the two have been evident in their recent back and forth on Medicare for All. Biden, who opposes the universal healthcare plan in favor of expanding the Affordable Care Act through a public option, has accused Warren and other supporters of Medicare for All of being dishonest. In particular, the former vice president has claimed Warren is lying about the true costs of Medicare for All and how she plans to fund the program. \u201cShe\u2019s making it up,\u201d the former vice president\u00a0told\u00a0PBS News Hour earlier this month\u00a0when asked about cost estimates Warren\u2019s campaign had released on the proposal: Look, nobody thinks it\u2019s $20 trillion. It\u2019s between 30 and $40 trillion. Every major independent study that\u2019s gone out there, that\u2019s taken a look at this, there is no way \u2014 even [Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)], who talks about the need to raise middle-class taxes, he can\u2019t even meet the cost of it. Warren has responded to such attacks by suggesting Biden was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d",

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " The latest Harvard/Harris Poll reveals that about six-in-ten U.S. voters said they are more likely to support 2020 presidential candidates who vow to strengthen the southern border \u201cto reduce illegal immigrants,\u201d among other things. Only about four-in-ten U.S. voters said they are more likely to vote for presidential candidates who promise to\u00a0open \u201cour borders to many more immigrants,\u201d as all leading 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidates have promised to do. As Breitbart News has noted, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have similar immigration plans \u2014 all designed to open the U.S.-Mexico border to more illegal immigration, provide big business with an endless flow of cheaper foreign labor, and increase foreign competition against America\u2019s working and middle class with increased legal immigration levels. Across all issues facing the nation, U.S. votes continue to say that health care and immigration remain the two most important problems in the upcoming 2020 election. For years, Trump has committed to reducing overall immigration to the country to boost wages and decrease labor market pressures for American workers. While Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d economy has resulted in record employment for nearly all demographic groups, there remains about 11.5 million Americans who are either unemployed, underemployed, or out of the labor market but all of whom want good-paying full-time employment.  Extensive research by economists like George Borjas and analyst Steven Camarota has found that the country\u2019s current legal immigration system \u2014 wherein 1.2 million mostly low-skilled workers are admitted annually \u2014 burdens U.S. taxpayers and America\u2019s working and middle class while redistributing about $500 billion\u00a0in wealth every year to major employers and newly arrived immigrants. Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, has found that every one-percent increase in the immigrant composition of American workers\u2019 occupations reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels. Every year, the U.S. admits about 1.2 million legal immigrants with the overwhelming majority, nearly 70 percent, coming through the process known as \u201cchain migration,\u201d whereby newly naturalized citizens are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign nationals to the country. The mass inflow of legal immigrants is in addition to the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who are added to the U.S. population annually. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

He said Biden had a great debate up until that point and said that gaffe was as bad as it could have gotten for the former vice president. 11:30 PM: The fifth Democratic debate has wrapped up! Warren spoke the most, followed by Buttigieg. Yang got the least speaking time. https://t.co/hThjmRLpvy pic.twitter.com/fbld4slcjZ \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) November 21, 2019  11:03 PM: Closing statements start. Booker says he has not qualified for the next debate and needs help. Booker says he saw John Lewis in the audience and says he is literally on the stage because a lawyer who decided to represent families who were discriminated against. \u00a0He says the lawyer told him he did so because he saw John Lewis being beaten by state trooper in Alabama. Booker says we have a \u201cmoral moment\u201d right now like in 1965 and he will cause, quoting John Lewis, \u201cgood trouble.\u201d He asks Americans to keep him on the stage. Steyer says everyone is more patriotic than the \u201ccriminal in the White House.\u201d He says he is different than everyone on stage because he knows government has been purchased by corporations and has spent a decade building coalitions to defeat those corporations. He says he is the only person talking about term limits. He says he has built international businesses and he is the only person who can say that \u201cMr. Trump\u201d is a fraud in his business dealings. He is making the electability argument. Gabbard talks about how everyone needs to be treated with respect\u2013 \u201cAloha\u201d values of inclusion, respect. She says Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii in 1959 and expressed his appreciation for the \u201cAloha spirit\u201d when it comes to racial justice. Gabbard said King said he saw the face of the future in Hawaii and says \u201clet\u2019s make Dr. King\u2019s dream a reality.\u201d\n\nYang says he is here with his wife and two kids. He says our children are not all right right now because of all of the economic disruptions, etc. Yang said he did not want to run for president but the people in Washington DC did not want to talk about issues like automation they did not understand and did not have solutions for. He says he is not running for president because he fantasized about running for president. He says he is running for president because he is a parent and patriot and sees the future and will not accept what he sees right now. Klobuchar says the election is about economics but it is also about patriotism and decency. She says people turned out in Virginia, Kentucky and says Democrats must also appeal to moderates who can\u2019t stomach Donald Trump. She again seems very jittery. Harris says we\u2019re in a fight for our rule of law, for our democracy, and for our system of justice. She says to fight this fight, Democrats must have the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump. She says she has taken on Sessions, Barr, Kavanaugh. She says she has never represented a corporation or special interests\u2026 she says justice (economic, reproductive, education) is on the ballot and America\u2019s promise will be unlocked if we overcome these injustices. Buttigieg talks about former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson and how he helped create the black middle class. He says he is not only running to beat Donald Trump but to also lead the era that comes after Trump. He says that era must be one of inclusion. He says he is inviting progressives, moderates, and future former Republicans to joint the movement he is building. Sanders says he is the son of an immigrant and stands with the undocumented immigrants. Says he spent a night in jail in the 1970s after protesting. He says he has received more campaign contributions at this point than any candidate in history. Warren says she hears a lot of great ideas. She says the majority of Americans are with Democrats on issues but corruption prevents issues from being solved. She says drug companies and big corporations benefits and talks about her anti-corruption plan. Biden says he hopes Warren wasn\u2019t talking about the \u201cspotless\u201d Obama administration when she was talking about corruption. Biden says we have the most productive workers and we are led by the power of our example. He says he is tired of people with the \u201cwoe is me\u201d attitude and repeats his stump speech. He talks about getting up and taking back the country: \u201cGet up and take it back.\u201d 11:02 PM: Steyer now talking about his Next Gen organization\u2019s ability to turn out voters in the 2020 so Democrats can have a \u201csweeping victory.\u201d 10:58 PM: Gabbard says Buttigieg\u2019s service is not enough for him to be Commander-in-Chief. Rips him for his \u201cinexperience\u201d and cites his recent \u201ccareless statement\u201d about how he would be sending troops to Mexico to fight to cartels. Buttigieg says his statement was taken out of context and was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. He now rips Gabbard for sitting down with a \u201cmurderous dictator like that\u201d (Assad). Gabbard says Buttigieg was asked if he would send troops to fight cartels and his answer was yes. Gabbard, responding to Assad criticisms, says Kennedy met with Kruschev, Reagan-Gorbachev. 10:57 PM: Buttigieg and Klobuchar spar over \u201cWashington experience\u201d after candidates discuss voting rights issues. He says there is over 100 years of Washington experience on the stage right now and asks where has that gotten us. 10:51 PM: Warren says abortion is a \u201chuman right\u201d and an \u201ceconomic right\u201d when asked if there is a room for a person like pro-life Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who just won re-election. She punts and when asked if there is room for someone like Edwards, she says she is not here to drive anyone out of the party. Sanders says this is the moment when men must stand up with women on abortion. Sanders says he is tired of conservatives who want government off the backs of Americans and don\u2019t understand that women, and not politicians, control their own bodies. 10:49 PM: Debate now turns to abortion. Klobuchar says we should \u201ccodify Roe v. Wade into law.\u201d She rips Trump for having said women and then doctors should go to jail. She says abortion will be a big issue in the general election. 10:42 PM: Booker rips Biden for not wanting to legalize marijuana at the federal level and he wondered if \u201che was high\u201d when he said it. Booker says marijuana is already legalize for the privileged. He says there are more African-Americans in prisons than slaves in 1850. Booker says Democrats need a candidate who will inspire black voters. But Booker and Harris aren\u2019t those candidates. Biden says marijuana should be decriminalized. \u201cEveryone gets out, records expunged,\u201d Biden says. Biden says he \u201ccomes out of the black community\u201d in terms of support and cites his endorsements from African American elected officials. Biden, talking about former Seantor Moseley Braun, says he has the support of the only African-American woman ever elected to the Senate. Harris jumps in and says: \u201cNope\u2026 The other one\u2019s here.\u201d Biden misspeaks and says he had support from \"the only African-American woman that had ever been elected to the United States Senate,\" before correcting that he meant \"first.\" Harris's reaction:pic.twitter.com/oIL1hcMfWS \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) November 21, 2019  10: 41 PM: Warren asked if she will use taxpayer money to take down parts of the border wall because she called the wall a monument to hate. Warren gives a confusing answer about taking parts down if they are not necessary and quickly shifts to children being caged in Amazon-like warehouses. 10:39 PM: Warren talking about student loan debt as an \u201ceconomic justice\u201d issue. She says black students are more likely to borrow money and more likely to be indebted. She says that is why everyone on the stage needs to embrace student loan forgiveness because it will \u201cclose the black-white\u201d income gap. 10:36 PM: Buttigieg says he his faith teaches him to care about those who are marginalized in society. He says though he does not have the experience of being a person of color, he sometimes has felt that he was a stranger in his own country. 10:35 PM: Harris given a chance to rip Buttigieg for his lack of support from black voters and she punts. Harris says Democrats for too long have taken black voters for granted. She says at some point, people get tired of being thanked for showing up and want politicians to show up for them. 10:32 PM: Biden asked about #MeToo. He says \u201cwe have to fundamentally change the culture\u201d re: how women are treated. He talks about the \u201cit\u2019s on us\u201d movement on college campuses that he help to spearhead to change the culture. Biden says no man has the right hit a women unless it is for self defense, which is rare. He then says we have to combat women\u2019s issues by keep \u201cpunching at it.\u201d 10:30 PM: Yang says white supremacist groups should be labelled as terrorist organizations so the federal government could get better data. Yang says we need to reach out boys who are susceptible to hate groups before they lose their way. 10:29 PM: Debate now turns to race. Candidates asked what they would do about white supremacism. Gabbard says leadership starts at the top and we \u201cset the record straight\u201d and correct the racial injustices that continue to exist. She says the war on drugs has disproportionately impacted people of color and the poor. She wants sentencing reforms and reforms to the money-bail system. 10: 23 PM: Warren, when asked about military issues, says she wants a force of 10,000 people to take care of and maintain national parks. 10:21 PM: Sanders says Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally. He says we have to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room and tell them the country is tired of spending billions because of their problems. He says the same goes for Israel-Palestinians. He says we need to be rethinking who are allies are around the world. Says he is pro-Israel but \u201cit is no longer good enough for us to be simply pro-Israel.\u201d He says America must treat Palestinians with \u201crespect.\u201d 10:18 PM: Biden, when asked about Saudi Arabia, says the Crown Prince should be punished and held accountable for\u00a0Khashoggi\u2019s murder. He says Saudi Arabia should be sold weapons and should be made a pariah. Klobuchar says China is in it for the long game and we need a president who has a long-term strategy on China. 10:17 PM: Booker rips Trump\u2019s \u201ctransactional\u201d foreign policy. He says Trump\u2019s scorecard on China is not good since it has become more authoritarian under Trump. He wants to check Putin, China and other countries trying undermine democracy. 10:15 PM: Yang says what he would say to Putin during their first phone call if he wins the White House. Yang says he will say he is sorry that \u201cI beat your guy.\u201d He will also tell him the the days of meddling in America\u2019s elections are over. Yang says he will tell him he will strengthen NATO. He says he will propose a new world data organization\u2013like the WTO for data. Yang also calls out China for human rights abuses. 10:12 PM: Sanders asked if he would cut a deal with the Taliban. Sanders takes the opening to say one of the differences between himself and Biden is that Biden supported the \u201cterrible war in Iraq\u201d while he voted against it. Sanders says we have to rethink the war on terror and if it necessary to cut a deal with the Taliban, he will do so. 10:10 PM: Mitchell asks Biden what he would do re: North Korea that Obama did not do in his eight years. Biden says that Kim Jong Un says he was a rabid dog that needed to be beaten with a stick. Biden says America needs to make clear to China that the country will move up its defenses and if they \u201cview that as a threat, it\u2019s an easy thing to respond to\u201d by putting pressure on North Korea. He says Trump has no idea what he\u2019s re: Korea. 10:09 PM: Mitchell asks Harris about North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un and nuclear concessions. Harris uses the question to say:\u00a0\u201cDonald Trump got punked.\u201d 10:07 PM: Sanders, taking a page out of AOC\u2019s playbook, says we don\u2019t have decades to solve the climate change problem. He says \u201cclimate refugees\u201d will cause national security problems all over the world. He says the fossil fuel industry is \u201ccriminally liable\u201d for lying about climate change and \u201cmaybe we should prosecute them as well.\u201d 10:03 PM: Maddow tees up a climate change question for Steyer. He says he is the only person on stage who will say climate is the number one priority. He says Biden won\u2019t say it. Warren won\u2019t say it. He says he will declare a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d and use the emergency powers of the presidency to combat climate change. He says it should be the top priority in his foreign policy. Biden says climate change is \u201cthe existential threat to humanity.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t need a \u201clecture from my friend\u201d on climate change issues. He now talks more gobbledygook and says Steyer was producing coal around the world than \u201call of Great Britain produces\u201d while he was passing climate legislation. Steyer says everyone needs to come to the same conclusion he did over a decade ago on climate. 10:02 PM: Gabbard talks about transitioning the country off of fossil fuels and ending the billions in subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry re: environmental threats. 10:01 PM: Buttigieg, asked if he would continue Trump\u2019s farm subsidies, says he has heard from many farmers that the subsidies are not making them whole. He rips Trump\u2019s \u201ctrade war\u201d that never should have been started. He talks about small refinery wavers that hurt ethanol producers. A very smart answer to appeal to Iowans. 9:54 PM: Booker now talks about gentrification and his ideas to use the tax law to empower renters as much as homeowners (mortgage interest deduction). 9:53 PM:\u00a0Warren says housing is how people build wealth and says the federal government has favored white people over blacks (redlining) and that still needs to be addressed. 9:50 PM: Julian Castro, who is not on the stage, said Democrats should talk about housing tonight. Welker asks Steyer why he is the best person to solve the housing crisis. Was he the best person to get this question? C\u2019mon. Steyer says resources need to be applied to build millions of units that are sustainable because it has a direct impact on climate. 9:46 PM: Klobuchar (proposing three months of paid family leave) and Harris (proposing six months) asked to explain their plans. Klobuchar says it is important that you pay for your plans because Trump lies and increases the debt while treating farmers and workers like \u201cpoker chips\u201d in a casino. She says Democrats have an obligation as a party to be fiscally responsible. Harris, when asked about her plan, tells people to go to her website to read all of her plans. She says it is no longer the case that people are not having children in their 20s. She says people are having kids in their 30s and 40s and they are now raising their kids and taking care of their aging parents. She says the burden falls on women to do that work and they have to make a difficult choice re: leaving good-paying jobs. She says six months is necessary for the reality of today. Liberal Democrats are going to love Harris\u2019s answer and was probably her best moment on policy in all of the debates. 9:45: Yang calls for paid family leave. He says the U.S. should not be on a list with Papua New Guinea (countries without paid family leave policies.) Yang takes the opportunity to tout his freedom dividend proposal that will allow families to pay for childcare or stay at home to raise their kids. 9:43 PM: Biden says Democrats should not say \u201clock him up\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s about civility\u201d and we need to restore the soul of the country. Sanders says more Americans are believing that Trump is in violation of the law after watching the impeachment hearings. Biden says Trump has \u201cindicted himself.\u201d Biden says there are two questions\u2013whether he should be impeached and removed and whether he should be prosecuted after he leaves office. He says the latter is a question for an attorney general. 9:41 PM: Maddow notes that people are now chanting \u201clock him up\u201d at the World Series and campaign events. She says that chant has been heard at two of Sanders\u2019 rallies and Maddow asks if Democrats should be okay with that. Sanders says nobody is above the law and if he did break the law, he should be prosecuted. 9:40 PM: Booker is asked if Trump communicated with Americans and tweeting all of his thoughts is a norm that should have been broken. Booker says Trump demeans and degrades the nation. A bizarre question that seemed to set up Booker to highlight that he used Twitter to communicated to citizens well before Trump but Booker whiffed. 9:39 PM: Biden basically says he will be a good president because he knows the names of all of the world\u2019s leaders. Sounds very establishment. 9:35 PM: Mitchell asks what Klobuchar meant when she implied Buttigieg would not be on the stage if he were a female. She says woman, though, are held to a higher standard and if not we would be able to play the game of naming our favorite female president. Klobuchar says she has passed over 100 bills and frames herself a consensus builder. It\u2019s misleading because she passes a lot of small bills that are often impossible not to get a consensus. Of course, moderators don\u2019t call her out on that. What huge bill is Klobuchar associated with? 9:33 PM: Buttigieg claims he has the right experience to take on Donald Trump. He says he \u201ccomes from the kind of communities\u201d that Trump claims he is helping. He says Trump claims to help people while traveling on private jets between golf courses. 9:32 PM: Yang finally gets a question. Parker says Yang has never served in the government and military and asks how he will be able to respond to terrorist attacks. Yang first praises Steyer for using his billions to fight climate change and says he should not criticized for doing so. Steyer replies: \u201cThank you, Andrew.\u201d Yang has says the next Commander-in-Chief should be focused on the threats of tomorrow. A good frame because Yang\u2019s whole campaign theme is that today\u2019s politician don\u2019t understand threat of the future like AI, etc. 9:31 PM: Klobuchar, contrasting herself with Steyer, says 9:30 PM: Worth noting that Yang is the only person who has not gotten a question. Bad form for MSNBC after a year of very strange omissions that has prompted even fairly neutral observers to call out the network: Why does @MSNBC keep leaving out @AndrewYang on their graphics (actually at 3% here)? This has happened on a number of occasions, I haven\u2019t seen with any other candidate. It\u2019s not just a slip up. Unacceptable. pic.twitter.com/2vJrYx5DKQ \u2014 ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) November 17, 2019  9:29 PM: Steyer gets a question. He talks about a broken government that is purchased by corporations. He says he has taken on a defeated tobacco companies, utilities, drug companies, etc. Will MSNBC ask him about his private equity deals? 9:25 PM: Gabbard is asked about what the \u201crot\u201d she she\u2019s in the Democratic party. Gabbard says the party continues to be influenced by the \u201cforeign policy establishment\u201d in Washington that Clinton represents along with the military industrial complex. She slams the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy doctrine. Interesting omission of Obama. Gabbard says as president she will end the regime-change wars and the new cold war. Harris is asked to respond and she says \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that we have someone on this stage\u201d who wants to be the party\u2019s nominee who spent years on Fox News criticizing Obama and \u201cbuddying up to Steve Bannon.\u201d Harris is months late on this comeback\u2013and it shows how unprepared she and her team were when Gabbard telegraphed her attacks against Harris a couple weeks ago. A day late and a dollar short. 9:22 PM: Welker asks Sanders if Obama is right when he said Americans don\u2019t want to tear the system down. Sanders says he isn\u2019t and then talks about a health care system that is \u201ccruel and dysfunctional.\u201d He says \u201csome of the people up here\u201d think should not take on the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. He\u2019s talking about Mayor Pete and Biden and maybe Booker. But he doesn\u2019t mention them by name. Dunce moderators do not ask Sanders which candidates he is talking about. Piss poor job of following up by this team so far. Out to lunch. 9:20 PM: Warren defends he Medicare for all plan. She says when people have had a chance to \u201cfeel it\u201d and \u201ctaste it\u201d after the third year, people are going to want it. Sanders, when finally brought into the discussion, says: \u201cThank you, I wrote the damn bill.\u201d 9:18 PM: Buttigieg says we are in a different environment than when Obama was president and claims that Democrats now have a majority on issues like guns and immigration if they can \u201cgalvanize\u201d and not \u201cpolarize.\u201d He pitches his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d plan and says Democrats should not be \u201ccommanding\u201d people to get Medicare. 9:14 PM: After Warren pitches her \u201ctwo cents\u201d wealth tax, Booker, backed by Wall Street, says he is for increasing the estate tax and does not agree with Warren\u2019s wealth tax. Booker says he wants a more just tax system and says the country needs to give more people opportunities to grow wealth. Booker, at the very end of the stage, gets a question before other candidates like Yang and Gabbard. It seems like MSNBC is trying its best to make Booker seem like the \u201cmoderate\u201d candidate Democrats should back. But there is a reason he is at the end of the stage. Warren says she is \u201ctired of freeloading billionaires\u201d and repeats her stump speech about everything a two-cent wealth tax can help accomplish. 9:11 PM: Harris is next and she says \u201cwe have a criminal in the White House.\u201d Harris is just a talking-point machine, re-upping some of her best anti-Trump lines from the trail. 9:08 PM: Mitchell asks Biden a good question. She mentions Biden has claimed Republicans will work again with Democrats if he becomes president. She asks how that will be possible when Republicans want him and his son investigated. \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t want me to be the nominee,\u201d Biden says, adding that he also found out Putin doesn\u2019t want him to be president from the hearings. Biden keeps stressing that he is the best person to beat Trump but never answers Mitchell\u2019s question. Mitchell doesn\u2019t follow up and lets Biden slide. Expect someone like Sanders to whack Biden on this later if given an opportunity. 9:07 PM: Buttigieg, asked the same question, says Trump\u2019s conduct should be central and claims Trump has already confessed his crimes on television. He says he will confront Trump for his wrongdoings but says he is also running to govern after Trump. He says when Trump is defeated, it will be a \u201ctender\u201d moment in a country when the sun will come up. He says the country will be more divided than ever and big issues still need to be addressed. 9:06 PM: Sanders says Trump is a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who is the \u201cmost corrupt president\u201d in modern history when asked how central Trump\u2019s conduct should be in the campaign. Sanders, stealing a bit from Yang, says Democrats cannot be consumed with Trump or they will lose the election. He says the American people understand that Congress can \u201cwalk and chew bubble gum at the same time\u201d by dealing with Trump\u2019s corruption and standing up for working families and fighting the corrupt political system and the \u201crigged economy.\u201d 9:04 PM: For some reason, Klobuchar is now given air time. She says she is for an impeachment inquiry but the jury is still out on the evidence. Won\u2019t commit to convicting and removing Trump like Warren. Klobuchar seems a bit jittery. 9:02 PM: Maddow begins with an impeachment question. Maddow asks Warren if she is willing to convince her Republican colleagues to convict Trump. What a softball question. Warren says of course. Warren now segues to money in politics, putting her against Democrats backed by big-money donors like Biden without mentioning anyone. Warren says ambassadorships should not be for sale. 9:00 PM: All candidates on stage as the debate is about to get started. Mitchell says they will cover a lot of topics, including \u201cnational security, race, and climate.\u201d 8:50 PM: Candidates about to take the stage. Chris Matthews says the impeachment hearings have shown that the Democrats are simply, more than anything, an \u201canti-Trump\u201d party. He says Democrats are more interested in bringing Trump down than they are about any of the presidential candidates and their platforms. 8:45 PM: A late entry into the race who obviously did not qualify for the debate: Governor @DevalPatrick was supposed to have an event at Morehouse College tonight. An organizer with the college who planned the event told CNN that Patrick cancelled the event when he arrived and learned that he would not have an audience.

Senator Warren has proposed an \u201cUltra-Millionaire Tax\u201d that would charge two cents for every dollar of household\u2019s wealth above $50 million. But her tax plans do not stop there. Warren would also create a billionaire\u2019s tax of 3 percent on fortunes over $1 billion. And recently she went back to the billionaire piggy bank, proposing an additional 3 percent tax on wealth over $1 billion. So for the ultra-wealthy, it is really a six-cent tax. Warren also supports a huge hike in payroll taxes. In her proposals, she has said she would\u00a0impose a 14.8 percent payroll tax on workers with incomes above $250,000. High-income households would also be hit by a 14.8 percent tax on investment incomes. What\u2019s more, Warren would tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for the top 1 percent of households. And she has said she would raise capital gains tax rates and lower the level of wealth that would be hit by the death tax.  ",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren falsely claimed the president broke the law \u201cagain and again and again,\u201d citing the Mueller report that found no evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, a moderator of Wednesday\u2019s Democrat debate, kicked off the evening by asking Warren if she will attempt to convince her Republican colleagues in the Senate to convict Trump. \u201cOf course I will,\u201d Warren stated. \u201cThe obvious answer is to say first, read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it. That shows you how the president tried to obstruct justice,\u201d she said, contending that Trump felt free to break the law \u201cagain and again and again, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened with Ukraine.\u201d \u201cWe have to have to establish the principle no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility and we need to meet it,\u201d she said. However, Warren\u2019s claim that the Mueller report showed clear obstruction of justice is false, as former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not make a determination. Attorney General William Barr ultimately concluded that \u201cthe evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.\u201d Mueller told\u00a0lawmakers over the summer: I want to add one correction to my testimony this morning. I wanted to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. [Ted Lieu (D-CA] \u2014 who said, and I quote, \u2018You didn\u2019t charge the president because of the [Office of Legal Counsel (OLC)] opinion.\u2019 That is not the correct way to say it. \u201cAs we say in the report and as I said in the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime,\u201d he added. Additionally, Warren\u2019s claim that the president broke the law \u201cagain and again and again\u201d \u2013\u00a0 particularly in regard to Ukraine \u2013 is false. On Wednesday, Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified before the House Intelligence Committee and stated that Trump told him, \u201cI want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.\u201d Sondland said: I finally called the president\u2026 I believe I just asked him an open-ended question, Mr. Chairman. What do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these different ideas and theories and this and that. What do you want? It was a very short abrupt conversation, he was not in a good mood, and he just said, \u2018I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing,\u2019 something to that effect. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) essentially dismantled the basis for the Democrats\u2019 entire impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, demonstrating that, despite Sondland\u2019s presumptions that a phone call, meeting, and aid were contingent on an announcement of an investigation into the 2016 elections and Burisma, the country received all three without any such pledge. \u201cI mean, you got all three of them wrong. They get the call, they get the meeting, they get the money. It\u2019s not 2+2. It\u2019s 0-3.\u00a0\u00a0I mean I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd you told Mr. Castor that the president never told you that the announcement had to happen to get anything. In fact. He didn\u2019t just not tell you that, he explicitly said the opposite,\u201d he added.",

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " \u201cThe real point here is that we need to stop this man-made crisis at the border,\u201d Warren said. \u201cTrump is the one who has created this crisis. \u2026 When I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families, I went down to the border.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men, and cages of little girls and little boys,\u201d Warren said. \u201cA great nation does not separate children from their families.\u201d As Breitbart News has chronicled, migrants are more often than not brutalized while making their journey to the U.S.-Mexico border. In a recent case, a federal immigration official said a pregnant migrant \u2014 saved by Border Patrol agents \u2014 was beaten by cartel smugglers because she did not pay her debt. After Border Patrol agents took her to a nearby hospital, the woman was treated for her injuries, while her child died as a result of the beating. Mexican drug cartels have profited\u00a0billions from America\u2019s open border through the drug trade and human trafficking, increasing their power in Mexico. Since 2009, there have been more than\u00a0250,000 homicides\u00a0in Mexico and at least 30,000 disappearances. In 2017, there were\u00a026,573 murders, 1,275 kidnappings, and 5,357 extortion cases in Mexico, marking the bloodiest year in the country in 20 years, despite these figures not capturing the scope of the cartel violence occurring\u00a0in Mexico. For Americans, the illegal immigration crisis is very real. In the last year alone, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested\u00a0more than 6,600 convicted murderers and convicted sex offenders who were in the United States illegally. Of that total, 4,975 of the illegal aliens arrested were convicted sex offenders. The other 1,641 illegal aliens had been convicted of homicide. Another 1,913 illegal aliens that were arrested by ICE had pending sex offense charges against them, while 387 illegal aliens had pending murder charges against them. For each one of these crimes, there are at least one or more American and legal immigrant victims. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at\u00a0@JxhnBinder.",

      "content": " All Democrats asked about it voiced support for impeaching Trump despite the House Democrats still conducting an impeachment inquiry to determine if they should advance articles of impeachment. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who was one of the first senators to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment, said she would try to convince her colleagues to impeach him, stating that Trump \u201cbroke the law\u201d in dealings with Ukraine. So far in the impeachment inquiry, none of the witnesses have testified they believe that Trump did anything illegal. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said it is \u201cvery clear\u201d Trump engaged in \u201cimpeachable conduct\u201d and added that Trump is \u201csucking up to Putin every minute of the day.\u201d She did not explain her comment. Trump actually approved giving Ukraine lethal weapons so that it could defend itself in its war with Russia. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) indicated that he supports impeaching Trump but tried to move beyond the issue. He said Democrats \u201ccannot simply be consumed\u201d by Trump because they would lose the election. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D-IN) also said there was \u201cimpeachable conduct\u201d that Trump has \u201calready confessed to on television,\u201d but he did not explain what he meant. He then attempted to pivot to other issues. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) called Trump a \u201ccriminal living in the White House, and that the \u201ccriminal enterprise\u201d involved Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. The debate moderators moved on to other questions after that. Follow Breitbart News\u2019\u00a0@Kristina_Wong.",

      "content": " \u201cThe Democrats on the stage tonight are shameless in their promotion of the ability to deny children the right to life,\u201d tweeted Stika, the bishop of Knoxville. The prelate also criticized the debate moderators for not pressing the candidates on how extreme they are on the issue, especially regarding sex-selective abortion. \u201cI wish they would be asked if they would support a woman\u2019s right to abort her daughter because she wanted a son,\u201d he said.  During the debate, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren reiterated her conviction that support for abortion is essential to the Democrats\u2019 identity as a party. \u201cProtecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party,\u201d she said, adding later that \u201cI believe that abortion rights are human rights.\u201d For her part, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar said she looks forward to debating President Trump and telling him that 70 percent of the public support Roe v. Wade. \u201cHe is off the track on this and he will hear from the women of America and this is how we\u2019re going to win this election,\u201d Klobuchar said. For his part, Bishop Stika has been an outspoken defender of the right to life of the unborn, decrying abortion as one of the great evils of our age. Last February, Stika slammed Democrats as \u201cthe party of infanticide\u201d for their blocking of anti-infanticide legislation in the Senate. The response of the Democrats \u201cdemonstrates that they are the Party of Infanticide,\u201d he tweeted, adding that history will one day judge them like the Democrats of the Civil War era \u201cwho believed slaves were not human.\u201d In September, the bishop denounced the hypocrisy of those who condemn the use of blackface years ago yet still support Planned Parenthood, which was founded to purge the world of \u201cinferior races.\u201d \u201cI just don\u2019t understand in this world of political correctness and so many attacking others because of blackface in the past,\u201d Stika tweeted. \u201cThe folks like the Democratic Party support Planned Parenthood. It was founded by a racists [sic] who who wanted to eliminate people of color and the poor.\u201d Stika said that he was appalled that Hillary Clinton had accepted the Margaret Sanger award, given Sanger\u2019s well-known racism. \u201cThis evil organization gives an award named for is racists [sic] founder that Hillary received and she said she was proud to receive it,\u201d the bishop said.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The poll, conducted November\u00a015-19, 2019, among 614 likely Democratic caucusgoers, showed Buttigieg firmly leading the pack with 26 percent support \u2013 a six-point jump from last month. Warren, who led the field with 28 percent support in last month\u2019s\u00a0Iowa State University/Civiqs poll, dropped nine points, putting her in second place with 19 percent support. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D) maintained their third and fourth place positions, with 18 percent support and 12 percent support, respectively. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) saw a slight uptick, coming in fifth place with five percent support. Andrew Yang (D), who saw the least amount of speaking time at Wednesday evening\u2019s Democrat debate, followed with four percent support. The remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.9 percent:  \u201cWarren has seen heightened scrutiny this past month, while Buttigieg has received mostly positive attention,\u201d Dave Peterson, the Whitaker Lindgren faculty fellow who organized the poll, stated. \u201cA little over 60% of the people who supported Warren in October still support her now, and those who switched went to Buttigieg,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat this tells me, is that there is a segment of Iowans backing the candidate getting the most positive coverage,\u201d Peterson added. \u201cIf we start seeing more scrutiny of Buttigieg, then his lead might prove to be temporary as well.\u201d Last month\u2019s results showed Warren leading with 28 percent support, followed by Buttigieg, Sanders, and Biden with 20 percent, 18 percent, and 12 percent, respectively:  Wednesday evening\u2019s debate was significant for Buttigieg, who was among the top in terms of speaking time. However, he faced backlash after suggesting that his sexuality, or being a gay \u201cstranger in my own country,\u201d will help him connect with and build support among black voters. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) described his comparison as \u201cmisdirected\u201d in a post-debate interview with Dana Bash. \u201cI don\u2019t \u2014I\u2019m never going to engage or allow anyone to engage in comparing struggles,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that is just misdirected.\u201d She continued: So we\u2019re going to now say that my pain is worse than your pain? We had 400 years of slavery in this country. We had years of lynching, which involved, black men in particular, being dragged from their homes and hung on a tree, often castrated. We\u2019ve had the years of Jim Crow and institutional racism that included redlining and systemic racism that lingers today. And then, you know, we also have our LGBTQ brothers and sisters who still, under the law, do not have full equality. These are all injustices, but to start comparing one group\u2019s pain to the other is misguided, and I think that anyone who wants to actually build the coalition around the country and bring people together should not be in the position of saying that one group\u2019s pain is equal to or less than or greater than another\u2019s.",

And I just hope everyone remembers what this looks like, there\u2019s like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men, and cages of little girls and little boys. In June 2018, Warren visited the McAllen Central Processing Center and has since continuously falsely accused Trump of holding \u201ccages of babies\u201d in detention at the southern border. Unmentioned by Warren is that the McAllen facility was opened in 2014 by Obama at the height of illegal immigration levels under the Obama administration. CNN reported on the opening of the facility in June 2014, noting that the processing center was a former\u00a0Gmark warehouse and was being converted into a detention center to help Border Patrol detain up to 1,000 Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) who arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border alone. Photos from 2014 \u2014 when Warren was silent about the facility \u2014 reveal that the detention center has largely operated in the same capacity from Obama to, now, Trump. Today, federal immigration officials said they have more aid and resources for border crossers in detention than previously thanks to humanitarian aid approved by Trump.

      "subtitle": "A majority of registered voters in Wisconsin oppose the impeachment and removal from office of President Trump, according to a poll released by Marquette University Law School Poll on Wednesday.",
      "author": "Michael Patrick Leahy",
      "content": " Fifty-three percent of poll respondents said they oppose the impeachment and removal from office of the president, while only 40 percent support it. The poll of 801 Wisconsin registered voters was conducted between November 13 and November 17. The poll of the key battleground state President Trump won in 2016 over Hillary Clinton by just 22,000 votes had more good news for the president. President Trump defeated five of the six 2020 Democrat presidential candidates polled against him in head-to-head matchups: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). Trump\u2019s lead ranged from three percent (against Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders) to five percent (Elizabeth Warren) to eight percent (against Pete Buttigieg) to 13 percent (against Amy Klobuchar). You can see the results of these five matchups here: President Trump 47 percent vs. Joe Biden 44 percent.\n\nPresident Trump 48 percent vs.\u00a0 Bernie Sanders 45 percent.\n\nPresident Trump 48 percent vs. Elizabeth Warren 43 percent.\n\nPresident Trump 47 percent vs. Pete Buttigieg 39 percent\n\nPresident Trump 50 percent vs. Amy Klobuchar 37 percent Surprisingly, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who is not among the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders in any national poll, is the only Democrat candidate who currently leads the president in Wisconsin, but that lead is a very narrow one. Booker has the support of 45 percent of poll respondents, compared to the 44 percent who support President Trump in a head-to-head matchup. The poll also has some good news for former Vice President Joe Biden, who is the number one choice of likely Democrat primary voters. Among likely voters in the April 7 Wisconsin Democrat primary voters, 30 percent say they would vote for Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders is in a distant second place with 17 percent, followed by Elizabeth Warren in third place with 15 percent and Pete Buttigieg in fourth place with 13 percent. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are tied for fifth place with three percent, while Andrew Yang and Kamala Harris are tied for seventh place with two percent. Wisconsin voters appear to not be all that interested in the details of the current impeachment investigation. Only 32 percent of respondents said they \u201cfollowed the news and testimony in the impeachment investigation by the House of Representatives\u201d very closely. Another 33 percent said they followed it fairly closely. Thirty-four percent said they followed it not closely or not at all. The Wisconsin poll was just the latest in a string of national and battleground state polls that have been favorable to the president. Wisconsin voters, though, appear to have a nuanced view of the president\u2019s conduct in office. Fifty-two percent of poll respondents believe President Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 29 percent do not, and 18 percent don\u2019t know. Forty-one percent of poll respondents believe President Trump\u00a0held up military aid to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 38 percent do not believe he held up the aid. On the bigger question of whether he did something \u201cseriously wrong\u201d in his dealings with Ukraine, a plurality of Wisconsin voters give President Trump the benefit of the doubt. While 42 percent of poll respondents believe the president did something \u201cseriously wrong\u201d in his dealings with Ukraine, 38 percent believe he did nothing wrong,\u00a0 while nine percent believe he did something wrong, but not seriously so. The president\u2019s job approval rating remains slightly under water with Wisconsin voters. Fifty-one percent of poll respondents disapprove of the president\u2019s job performance either \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat,\u201d while 47 percent approve of his job performance \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat.\u201d The president gets good ratings for his handling of the economy, with 55 percent approving his performance on that front and 40 percent disapproving it. Forty-five percent of poll respondents identified as Republican, 44 percent identified as Democrat, and ten percent identified as Independent.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren delivered a speech at the historically black university Thursday evening and stressed the need to pass Lee\u2019s reparations legislation, which \u201cestablishes the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: It\u2019s time for our government to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations,\u201d Warren wrote in a tweet containing a video of her remarks:  \u201cAmerica was founded on principles of liberty and built\u00a0on the backs of enslaved people.\u00a0[It\u2019s] time to adopt H.R. 40, Sheila Jackson Lee\u2019s reparations plan. [It\u2019s] time to do what\u2019s right, so that our nation can begin to heal,\u201d Warren stated. The commission, according to the summary, would examine slavery and discrimination from 1619 to the modern era and \u201crecommend appropriate remedies.\u201d While Warren said that would be a \u201cbig step,\u201d she suggested that more must be done. \u201cThis is a big step but slavery is not the only history we must confront. Jim Crow was the lived reality in American up through the 1960s,\u201d Warren said. She continued: Government redlining meant that too often, toxic waste dumps and polluting factories were located far away from white communities and right next to black communities. The 1994 crime bill exacerbated the mass incarceration that locked up millions of black men and women. So don\u2019t talk about race-neutral laws. The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active state-sponsored discrimination, and that means the federal government has a responsibility to fix it. The presidential hopeful argued that each of her plans has an element that will address what she considers racial injustice. For instance, she said her Green New Deal plan would \u201cput racial and environmental justice at the center of our response to climate change.\u201d \u201cMy health care plan will bring down the costs of prescription drugs and tackle the risks of black maternal mortality that is literally killing black women and their babies,\u201d she continued, seemingly ignoring her support for abortion and the impact that has had on the black community. \u201cMy public education plan will put 800 billion new dollars in federal money into our public schools and quadruple the funding or schools that teach low-income children. My student debt cancellation plan will help close the black-white wealth gap in America,\u201d she continued, triumphantly declaring that her plans are \u201call paid for.\u201d \u201cOne more thing about those plans: They are all paid for, not by raising taxes one penny on working families,\u201d she claimed. \u201cThey are all paid for by asking the wealthy and well-connected to just pay a fair share.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for a wealth tax in America. Two cents!\u201d she declared. This is not the first time Warren has signaled support for having a conversation on issuing reparations. She called for a \u201cnational, full-blown\u201d conversation\u201d in March:  However, when asked about the \u201cdirect transfers of money\u201d during a CNN town hall event in March, Warren dodged the question, instead stressing the need for further conversations. \u201cIf I could just follow up on Georgia\u2019s question, you said you\u2019re open to a conversation about reparations to the descendants of slaves and Native Americans? Might that include direct payments? Direct transfers of money?\u201d CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked. Warren replied: There\u2019s a lot of ways to think about the way they should be formed. And I noticed Georgia\u2019s question started with the frame of an apology and national recognition. We have a lot of experts around the country, a lot of activists that have a whole lot of different approaches to it and I think the best we can do right now \u201cI love the idea of this congressional commission, let\u2019s bring people together and let\u2019s open that conversation as Americans. Let\u2019s see what ideas people want to put on the table and let\u2019s talk them through,\u201d she continued. \u201cBecause I have to tell you, ignoring the problem is not working,\u201d she added, failing to answer the specific question.",

      "subtitle": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is more than recovering from his end-of-summer slump, surpassing Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and tying with Joe Biden (D) nationally, a National Emerson College poll released this week shows.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren, while still a top tier candidate, fell to third place in the latest Emerson poll, which was taken\u00a0November 17-20, 2019, among 1,029 registered voters. Both Sanders and Biden tied with 27 percent support each, followed by the Massachusetts senator, who garnered 20 percent support. The margin of error is +/- 2.9 percent, making her third-place status solid. The survey found that Sanders is continuing to hold on to his status as the preference for younger voters, as well as Hispanic or Latino voters. Per Emerson: Sanders continues to hold a strong lead with younger voters in the primary. Among voters under 50, Sanders received 37% support, followed by Warren with 22%, Biden with 15% and Yang with 7%. Among voters 50 and over, Biden continues to lead with 44% support, followed by Warren with 16%, Sanders with 13% and Buttigieg with 12%. \u2026 Sanders holds a lead among Hispanic or Latino voters with 36% support, followed by Biden with 23% and Warren with 22%. Sanders leads by a smaller margin with White voters with 29% support followed by Biden and Warren with 21%, and Buttigieg with 9%. Biden continues to lead with African American voters with 42% support, followed by Warren with 18%, Sanders with 17% and Buttigieg with 7%. No other candidate came close to Sanders, Biden, or Warren. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has been surging in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, came in fourth with seven percent support. Andrew Yang (D) overtook Sen Kamala Harris (D-CA) for fifth place with four percent to her three percent. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less:  \u201cBiden and Sanders continue to hold their bases, which should concern Warren, as she has waited for one of the front runners to slip these past few months \u2013 yet, their support seems to be crystalizing,\u201d Emerson Polling director Spencer Kimball said. The current Real Clear Politics average also reflects a steady Sanders surge, showing the socialist senator in second place with a 19.3 percent average compared to Warren\u2019s 18.5 percent. Notably, the Emerson poll was taken, largely, in the days leading up to Wednesday evening\u2019s Democrat presidential debate. It remains to be seen how much the debate shifted the needle among Democrat voters, although the debate saw the lowest ratings to date with just 6.5 million viewers tuning in.",

      "subtitle": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Thursday released an ad slamming politicians for rewarding big donors with ambassadorships, despite the fact that she supported the big donors former President Obama nominated, many of whom had no experience.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren answered a question about the ongoing partisan impeachment hearing during Wednesday evening\u2019s Democrat debate and mentioned Ambassador Gordon Sondland \u2013 a key witness of the Democrats who testified that Trump told him, \u201cI want nothing. I want no quid pro quo\u201d \u2013 and contended he landed his position due to his status as a big donor. She said: But I want to add one more part based on today\u2019s testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications, except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. And that tells us about what\u2019s happening in Washington, the corruption, how money buys its way into Washington. You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they\u2019re going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I\u2019ve taken a pledge. Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don\u2019t ask to be an ambassador, because I\u2019m not going to have that happen. I asked everyone who\u2019s running for president to join me in that and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder. She also released an ad, reiterating the point she made during the debate. Warren states in the ad: At the center of Donald Trump\u2019s crimes and chaos is the millionaire donor he made an ambassador Republicans and Democrats have been rewarding big donors with cushy ambassadorships like this for years. It\u2019s Washington corruption at its worst. When I\u2019m president, that stops. I\u2019m the only candidate running who\u2019s made this promise. I\u2019ll never give ambassadorships to\u00a0unqualified donors just because they wrote me fat checks.  However, Warren did not seem to take issue with the concept during Obama\u2019s tenure, confirming his nominees who held no diplomatic experience. One of those nominees included Hollywood producer\u00a0Colleen Bell, whose experience amounted to raising $2 million for Obama\u2019s campaigns. Despite that, he nominated her to be the ambassador to Hungary. \u201cDuring her confirmation hearing, Bell\u00a0failed\u00a0to name a single strategic interest the United States has in Hungary,\u201d as the Washington Free Beacon reported. Nevertheless, Warren confirmed her. More via Free Beacon: Warren was a senator, for example, when Obama nominated Noah Bryson Mamet to be U.S. ambassador to Argentina\u2014Mamet was a\u00a0political operative\u00a0with no diplomatic experience who\u00a0raised millions of dollars\u00a0for Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns. It was revealed during Mamet\u2019s confirmation hearing that he had\u00a0never been to Argentina. Warren voted to\u00a0confirm\u00a0Mamet, who passed through the Senate with 50 votes and none from Republicans. \u2026 Warren also voted to\u00a0confirm\u00a0Crystal Nix-Hines, who\u00a0wrote scripts\u00a0for ABC\u2019s\u00a0Alias\u00a0and\u00a0raised over $1 million\u00a0for Obama, to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. An analysis by the\u00a0Center for Public Integrity\u00a0found that Obama rewarded 31 of his campaign bundlers with ambassador posts during his second term. Another 39 ambassador nominees \u201ceither gave him campaign money or are known political allies.\u201d Warren has yet to publicly address the reasoning behind her previous votes that directly contradict the position she outlines in her presidential platform.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren released her education plan in October, which called to eliminate school\u00a0vouchers, tuition tax credits, and federally funded expansions of charter schools, as Breitbart News reported. \u201cWe should stop the diversion of public dollars from traditional public schools through vouchers or tuition tax credits \u2013 which are vouchers by another name,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cWe should fight back against the privatization, corporatization, and profiteering in our nation\u2019s schools,\u201d she continued. A school choice activist confronted Warren at a campaign event in Atlanta, Georgia, on Thursday, the same activist who reportedly led the protest against the presidential candidate during her speech at\u00a0Clark-Atlanta University the same day. \u201cWe are going to have the same choice that you had for your kids because I read that your children went to private schools,\u201d the activist, Sarah Carpenter told Warren. \u201cMy children went to public schools,\u201d Warren told her:   However, according to the Free Beacon, Warren sent her son Alex to a private school: A school yearbook obtained by the\u00a0Washington Free Beacon\u00a0indicates, however, that Warren\u2019s son, Alex Warren, attended the Kirby Hall School for at least the 1986-1987 school year,\u00a0Warren\u2019s final year as a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. The college preparatory school is known for its \u201cacademically advanced curriculum\u201d and offers small class sizes for students in grades K-12. The yearbook indicates that Alex Warren attended as a fifth grader. Warren\u2019s campaign confirmed that her son went to private school \u2013 a private school that currently costs roughly $15,000 per year. \u201cAccording to the\u00a0Austin American-Statesman, Kirby Hall\u2019s tuition was $4,700 a year in 1995, the earliest record of the school\u2019s tuition costs reviewed by the\u00a0Washington Free Beacon,\u201d the outlet reported. \u201cElizabeth\u2019s daughter went to public school. Her son went to public school until 5th grade,\u201d Warren communications director Kristen Orthman said in a statement to both Free Beacon and Fox News. She added: Elizabeth wants every kid to get a great education regardless of where they live, which is why her plan makes a historic investment in our public schools. Every public school should be a great school. Her plan does not affect funding for existing non-profit charter schools, but she believes we should not put public dollars behind a further expansion of charters until they are subject to the same accountability requirements as public schools. Warren\u2019s current stance stands in stark contrast to the position she held during her 2012 senatorial campaign. At the time, she emphatically supported charter schools and school vouchers. During an interview with Fox Business in May 2011, she said: The point is, we have a private school system now, only the way it\u2019s doled out is instead of paying tuition, you buy a house in a certain zip code and pay taxes and keep everyone locked out who\u2019s not in that zip code. We call those public schools. But look at the financing for them. If every child in the state of Massachusetts \u2014 every child in this country \u2014 got a ticket, and the ticket was funded by taxpayers, because I believe in public education, but it could be used at any school regardless of what kind of house parents can afford to buy,\u00a0it would first take the pressure off parents in terms of having to buy those houses, and second would mean that those schools now compete with each other for offering the kind of education that really produces results and parents can buy into and believe in. Warren\u2019s current education plan also includes a proposition for \u201cfree\u201d universal pre-k, the cancellation of student lunch debt, and\u00a0enhanced protections for illegal immigrant students.",

Big structural change can\u2019t wait, and we\u2019ll fight for it\u2014together.\u201d Warren announced on Twitter:  Haaland, one of two Native American women in Congress, faced backlash for endorsing Warren, given the presidential hopeful\u2019s past of falsely claiming Native American heritage. \u201cWhat the hell,\u201d says one of the most liked comments on Haaland\u2019s Instagram post announcing the endorsement. \u201c[Warren has] made her career by trivializing who we are for her own gain.\u201d The commenter, a Native American whose sentiment is echoed by many other replies, is referring to Warren\u2019s contentious claims of possessing indigenous heritage.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT), 78, born in September 1941, remains the oldest candidate by about five months. President Donald Trump, 72, was born in 1946 and was 69 years old when he launched his presidential campaign. Democrats now have four major candidates in their seventies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) turned 70 in June this year. In contrast, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is only 37 years old \u2014 roughly half the age of the three national frontrunners. (He leads the latest polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two first states to vote in the primary process.) In an announcement on his campaign website, Bloomberg declared: We cannot afford four more years of President Trump\u2019s reckless and unethical actions. He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage. The stakes could not be higher. We must win this election. And we must begin rebuilding America. I believe my unique set of experiences in business, government, and philanthropy will enable me to win and lead. As a candidate, I\u2019ll rally a broad and diverse coalition of Americans to win. And as president, I have the skills to fix what is broken in our great nation. And there is a lot broken. Bloomberg is apparently going to skip the four early primaries and spend heavily on advertising in the hope of picking up a large number of delegates on Super Tuesday, March 3, 2020. Joel B.
