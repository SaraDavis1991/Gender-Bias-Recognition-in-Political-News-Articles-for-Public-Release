      "content": " Warren said, \u201c40,000 Americans died last year from gun violence.\u201d Warren\u2019s claim is actually a loose reference to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention numbers for 2017\u2013the most recent numbers\u2013which show 39,773 people died in a firearm-related death. However, Warren did not mention that nearly two-thirds of those deaths were due to suicide, not \u201cgun violence.\u201d In fact, the surge in the gun deaths was the result of a surge in suicides. And the Chicago Tribune\u2019s\u00a0Steven Chapman\u00a0notes\u00a0that \u201cthe increase was actually greater for the non-firearm suicide rate than for the firearm suicide rate.\u201d But Warren presented it all as due to \u201cgun violence,\u201d before pledging to more gun control, which included a promise to reduce the number of \u201cgun violence\u201d deaths by 80 percent.

      "subtitle": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has been speaking to Hillary Clinton behind the scenes throughout her presidential bid, according to sources who spoke with NBC News.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " It was widely\u00a0reported\u00a0Clinton met with several potential 2020 candidates at the beginning of the year, including former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D), Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). However, the failed presidential candidate has been speaking to Warren in recent months,\u00a0according to sources who spoke to NBC News. Sources are not sure how many conversations Warren has had with Clinton, and neither has made obvious attempts to make their conversations nor the nature of them known to the general public. NBC News reports: One source was aware of just one additional call between Warren and Clinton since then. But a person who is close to Clinton said the contact has been substantial enough to merit attention, describing a conversation between the two as seemingly recent because it was \u201cfront of mind\u201d for her. \u201cThat has clearly not gone unnoticed, and I think she really appreciates that,\u201d the person close to Clinton said. It is established both women want President Trump out of the White House, though it is possible that Warren has failed to make her points of contact explicitly known due to the optics, as Clinton \u2013 another female who attempted to break the glass ceiling \u2013 lost handily to Trump in 2016. \u201cTo the extent that Democratic primary voters fear a repeat scenario in 2020 \u2014 and to the extent that she\u2019s competing with Sanders for the votes of progressives \u2014 there may be good reason for Warren to keep her distance from Clinton publicly,\u201d NBC News reports. It notes Clinton could be a valuable asset in the event Warren \u201cfinds herself battling for delegates and superdelegates\u201d at next year\u2019s Democratic National Convention in\u00a0Milwaukee, Wisconsin\u2013 the same state Clinton lost in 2016. \u201cHillary Clinton would absolutely have influence over a number of delegates to this convention,\u201d Deb Kozikowski, the vice chair of the Massachusetts Democratic Party, told NBC News. \u201cIt would be counterproductive for the first woman nominee of the party to not be supportive of a woman who may go over that threshold,\u201d Kozikowski added. According to a Democrat strategist who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity, Clinton admires Warren\u2019s campaign. \u201cShe has applauded her about being serious and disciplined and loves that she is sticking to her guns,\u201d the strategist said. Warren\u2019s team would not provide NBC News with details on Clinton and Warren\u2019s relationship or their conversations, but the outlet admits that the\u00a0duo\u2019s contact \u201cappears to have been more than a courtesy call or a trip to the principal\u2019s office.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "A California poll of Democrat primary voters in the state has Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) surging past favorite daughter Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and former Vice President Joe Biden in the Golden State ahead of the second debates upcoming at the end of July.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " The tracking survey of 4,050 respondents, conducted by Capitol Weekly, has Warren at 24.8 percent in California, while Harris is at 20.3 percent and Biden is at 19.6 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is at 15.6 percent and South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg is down at 7.7 percent. The only other candidate to break the 2 percent threshold, at 2.4 percent, is former Rep. Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke (D-TX).  The fact that Warren is leading Harris and Biden in California, one of the biggest states in the union and an important early battleground state should the race last longer than just Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, is particularly important and interesting. It suggests that Harris, who led a different survey out this week in California by one point over Warren, is having difficulty locking up her home state. It also suggests Biden is on the decline in a big way in key Democrat states, and will need to lock in some solid victories ahead of California in states like Iowa or South Carolina if he is to win the nomination. South Carolina polling has had Biden with consistent strong leads over the rest of the field. The previous California survey, from Change Research, had Biden down in fourth place in California at 17 percent, with Harris out in front at 23 percent and Warren right behind her at 22 percent. Sanders came in third in that survey at 20 percent. While Warren is out in front in the new Capitol Weekly poll, there are also some interesting data points when it comes to survey respondents\u2019 second choice\u2013with regard to both Harris and Warren. \u201cWhile the initial vote is the most watched metric, there are underlying measures that can also be extremely valuable to track over time.\u00a0 One of these is the \u2018second choice\u2019 of voters \u2013 those candidates who are consistently viewed as a backup option for voters as their primary choice might falter later in the process,\u201d Capitol Weekly wrote in a piece about the survey data. \u201cOn this metric, we see Harris and Warren consistently at the top of the rankings. Within the CA120 tracking infographic you can actually select any candidate to identify whose voters are likely to support as a second choice. Harris is the second choice of backers of every single candidate in the poll (including the recently exited Congressman Eric Swalwell) except for those who prefer Sanders, whose support goes to Warren as a second choice.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "CLAIM: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) \u201cdidn\u2019t have 20,000 people\u201d at her rally in Manhattan on Monday night, according to President Donald Trump.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " As Trump suggested Tuesday, Warren appears to have exaggerated the size of her rally crowd in Washington Square on Monday night \u2014 apparently the third time she has done so in recent weeks. Warren\u2019s campaign claimed that 20,000 people had shown up for the event. However, as Breitbart News reported, New York City Parks said that the park did not hold more than 10,000 \u2014 the maximum permitted for the event. Last month, in Minnesota, the Warren campaign claimed that she had drawn a crowd of 12,000 to the campus of\u00a0Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. But college officials told Breitbart News that the field only had capacity for 3,000, with some \u201cspillover.\u201d Given that the event had been moved outdoors out of concern that the largest indoor hall, at a capacity of 4,000, would be too small, a generous estimate would have put the crowd at 6,000. Nevertheless, many media outlets reported the 12,000 figure, though the only source for that claim was the Warren campaign, and there was no official count from local police, campus officials, or fire marshals. In New Hampshire, the Warren campaign claimed that a crowd of 700 people attended an outdoor town hall event on a farm in Franconia. But Breitbart News \u2014 which was there \u2014 judged the crowd at \u201cover 300,\u201d based on a visual estimate. The pattern appears to be that the Warren campaign claims twice the attendance that can actually be confirmed. There is no doubt that Warren is drawing the largest crowd of any Democratic candidate right now \u2014 certainly larger than frontrunner Joe Biden. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is also filling halls but has shied away from larger arenas. Warren\u2019s aim appears to be to compare her crowd sizes not with those of her Democratic rivals, but with those of President Donald Trump, who regularly draws numbers in the tens of thousands. The message Warren is sending to Democratic voters is that she will be the most competitive general election candidate against Trump. It is an indirect attack on the \u201celectability\u201d argument that Biden has made to the Democratic Party primary electorate. The media seem eager to oblige her claims \u2014 and they have been caught underestimating Trump\u2019s crowd sizes. Last month, he broke an attendance record at the SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire, but mainstream outlets ran inaccurate stories about empty seats. But Trump has been known to exaggerate crowd size in the past. In this case, Warren is learning from the master. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "subtitle": "The tide may be turning in Iowa, where Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has taken a huge lead, according to an\u00a0Iowa Starting Line-Change Research poll released Thursday.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The poll, taken August 9\u201311, surveyed 621\u00a0likely Iowa Democrat caucus-goers. Of those, 28 percent said they support Warren, putting her 11 points ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Joe Biden (D), who garnered 17 percent support each. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) toppled Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) for fourth place, with 13 percent support to Harris\u2019s eight. Both Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) saw three percent support. The remaining candidates garnered two percent or less. The poll\u2019s margin of error is +/- 3.9 percent. Warren \u2013 by far \u2013 has experienced the biggest jump in the Hawkeye State, seeing a 16 point gain since May. As Iowa Starting Line pointed out: May Poll (change to August)\n\nJoe Biden: 24% (-7)\n\nBernie Sanders: 24% (-7)\n\nPete Buttigieg: 14% (-1)\n\nElizabeth Warren: 12% (+16)\n\nKamala Harris: 10% (-2)\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke: 5% (-2) This follows Sanders\u2019 surge in the early primary state New Hampshire. A Gravis Marketing poll released last week showed the socialist senator leading the pack, six points ahead of Biden, who dropped to second place. As Breitbart News reported: Sanders leads the pack with 21 percent support, followed by Joe Biden (D) with 15 percent support, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) with 12 percent. Warren\u2019s failure to capture second place is significant, as she and Sanders share similar far-left ideologies and represent New England states neighboring New Hampshire. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in with eight percent, one point above Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s (D-CA) seven percent support, further signifying the loss of the momentum she sufferred after the first Democrat debate. However, Biden is still the fan favorite in South Carolina, another crucial early primary state. As Breitbart News reported: A survey\u00a0released\u00a0by Change Research and\u00a0The Post and Courier\u00a0on Wednesday shows Biden leading in South Carolina by double digits. Conducted between August 9 through August 12 by surveying 521 likely primary voters, the poll is one of the first out of the Palmetto State since the second Democrat presidential debate. When stacked up against candidates in the field of 2020 Democrats, Biden takes first place with 36 percent support \u2014 an advantage of 19 points over his nearest challenger. Coming in second place was Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at 17 percent, although she narrowly beat out Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), who landed in third place with 16 percent support, for the spot. Typically, a candidate who wins two of the three early primary states \u2013 New Hampshire, Iowa, and South Carolina \u2013 tends to secure the nomination. However, it will make for an interesting primary if Sanders maintains his lead in the Granite State and Warren\u2019s support grows in Iowa.",

Students were asked, \u201cRegardless of who you may support in the upcoming 2020 presidential election, who would you most like to be the Democratic nominee for President?\u201d The latest update, on October 15, showed Warren leaping to first place with 32 percent to Sanders\u2019 27 percent. This is significant, as Sanders has dominated as the frontrunner since the tracker\u2019s formal launch in March. On March 26, Warren only had six percent support in the poll compared to Sanders\u2019 33 percent. The \u201cgender gap\u201d on the two candidates is hitting an \u201call-time high,\u201d according to College Pulse. Among female college students, Warren leads 34 percent to 27 percent, while Sanders leads among male college students with 31 percent to Warren\u2019s 21 percent. No other candidate comes close to Warren or Sanders, with Joe Biden (D) falling to a distant third with just ten percent support among Democrat and Democrat-leaning college students\u2013 a long fall from the 22 percent he garnered in March. Andrew Yang (D) falls closely behind Biden with nine percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), Beto O\u2019Rourke (D), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), with seven percent, four percent, and three percent, respectively. The margin of error was not immediately available. Harris\u2019s three percent support marks an \u201call-time low\u201d for the candidate,\u201d College Pulse assessed. The poll also found that the majority of college students, 54 percent, have an unfavorable view of Biden. Only 45 percent have a favorable view of the former vice president, whose role in the questionable foreign business dealings of his son has been a topic of controversy in recent weeks.

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " What is this all about? One thing, and one thing only. Should she win the Democrat nomination for president, the last thing she wants is the spectacle of American Indians protesting the fact that for decades, and as a means to advance her academic and political fortunes, The Whitest Woman In The World falsely identified herself as a Cherokee Indian. And this fraud extend through last year, until Warren was 69-years-old. Because it was just last year, in a cynical and audaciously dishonest effort to prove she was indeed a member of Cherokee Nation, Warren lied about the results of her DNA test; a DNA test that actually proved she has no more Native blood than any other white person. In fact, because her genome could range from 1/64 to 1/1024 \u201cNative,\u201d she probably has less. So now, in order to buy off the American Indian, she\u2019s offering billions of our tax dollars for something called the Honoring Promises to Native Nations Act. Worse, in keeping with her tradition of speaking with forked tongue, while appearing before an American Indian advocacy group in Iowa this week, she offered up 1/1024th of an apology for decades and decades of identity fraud and lies. Like anyone who\u2019s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes. I am sorry for harm I have caused. I have listened and I have learned a lot, and I am grateful for the many conversations we have had together. What is she talking about\u2026? What is she apologizing for\u2026? Does anyone know? I don\u2019t understand the words that are coming out her mouth because she has never once admitted to doing anything wrong\u2026 I this an apology for littering? For filling up her gas tank and taking off? Did she engage in some underage drinking? Did she cheat on her husband, kick a puppy, run with scissors, cheat at Monopoly, shoot a man in Reno just to watch him die? What the hell is she apologizing for\u2026? And how can she apologize when she refuses to admit there has been no wrongdoing? Elizabeth Warren has admitted to NO mistakes, but she thinks she can apologize without admitting to those mistakes, without telling us what those mistakes were. Sorry, no, it doesn\u2019t work that way. Here she is in front of a group of American Indians looking to buy their support, silence, and souls with the apology-equivalent of glass beads. Listen, I am all in favor of second chances, of accepting apologies, of moving on, and if Warren had half a brain in that shrill, neurotic head of hers, she would have used that DNA test as an out, as a way to say, \u201cYou know what, I was wrong. I should not have depended on family lore. I apologize.\u201d But no, instead she counted on the fake news media to shove the lie through, to make it stick, but made the mistake of doing so in an era when that is no longer possible. Hey, 50 years ago the fake news media could convince the public that Ted Kennedy leaving a woman to die was just another \u201cKennedy family tragedy,\u201d but in the reality of today\u2019s New Media, those days are long gone. And now she\u2019s doubling down, obfuscating, dissembling, apologizing while not apologizing, which means nothing has changed. Until last year \u2014 keep that in mind \u2014 until just last year, this whiter than white woman sought to exploit the identity of the American Indian for her own personal gain, and she is still doing it \u2014 still exploiting the Indian; looking to buy them off with empty promises, with a non-apology-apology, with rhetorical trinkets.

      "content": " YouGov surveyed 1500 U.S. adults (1127 of which are registered voters) August 10\u201313 and asked likely Democrat primary voters, \u201cIf the Democratic presidential primary or caucus in your state were held today, who would you vote for?\u201d Biden came in with 21 percent support among Democrat primary voters. Warren \u2013 who has found herself on Biden\u2019s heels in recent weeks \u2013 came right up behind him with 20 percent support. With a margin of error of +/-\u00a02.6 percent (when adjusted for weighting) and +/- 3 percent (for registered voters), the two are statistically tied for first place. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) came in third place with 16 percent support \u2013 a gain of three percent in one week. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) came in with eight percent support, followed by Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who garnered five percent each. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) came in right behind them with two percent support. The remaining candidates garnered one percent support or less. Eleven percent said they were \u201cnot sure\u201d whom they would choose:  The poll echoes the findings of additional national surveys, showing Sanders and Warren on the rise and Harris at a stalemate, losing most of the momentum she gained after her fiery performance at the first debate in June. It is true that the candidate who wins two of the three early primary states \u2013 New Hampshire, Iowa, and South Carolina \u2013 tends to secure the nomination, but Biden does not have all three locked up. While the former vice president seems to have an iron grip on the early primary state of South Carolina, a recent poll shows Sanders surging in New Hampshire, topping Biden by six percent:  Biden is leading in Iowa by less than ten points, with Warren firmly in second place.",

He\u2019s sworn to serve the people of the United States, but he only serves himself and his partners in corruption,\u201d she said, accusing him of dividing people based on religion, race, and gender. \u201cHe tries to divide us. White against black, Christian against Muslim, straight against queer and trans, and everyone against Democrats,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBecause if we\u2019re all busy fighting each other, no one will notice that he and his buddies are stealing more and more our country\u2019s wealth and destroying the future for everyone else,\u201d she added:  Warren also used the opportunity to resurrect the Muller report \u2013 which found no evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2013 and called for Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cAnd yeah. When we\u2019re talking corruption, we need to call it out in the Oval Office,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI read all 448 pages of the Mueller report. No one is above the law, not even the United States president.\u201d \u201cImpeachment is our Constitutional duty,\u201d she added. Warren\u2019s campaign has touted the Washington Square Park event as her biggest rally to date, with 20,000 in attendance. However, NYC Parks told Breitbart News that it could not corroborate the campaign\u2019s estimates and that it issued a permit for 8,000 \u2013 10,000, with the park\u2019s capacity at roughy 10,000.",

      "author": "Allum Bokhari",
      "content": " In March, Warren called out Facebook for its \u201cability to shut down a debate.\u201d The context was Facebook\u2019s decision to temporarily take down several of her posts that called for the breakup of\u00a0 the tech giant.  The text of her proposal to break up big tech calls for the designation of major tech platforms as \u201cplatform utilities,\u201d that would be required to \u201cmeet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users\u201d \u2014 if this was meant in good faith, it would mean that users couldn\u2019t be discriminated against on the basis of their political viewpoints or opinions. But Warren doesn\u2019t actually believe that. Far from opposing big tech\u2019s ability to, in her words, \u201cshut down a debate,\u201d she fully supports it \u2014 when the debate has been started by someone she disagrees with. Warren recently called on big tech to crack down on speech she disagrees with, after black Twitter user Ali Alexander questioned whether Kamala Harris, a second-generation Jamaican-Indian, could fully lay claim to the American black identity. Warren today took to Twitter called the insinuation \u201cracist and ugly\u201d and reminded tech companies that they could \u201cstop these vile lies dead in their tracks.\u201d Instead of simply challenging or denouncing the claim in an open marketplace of ideas, Warren went further \u2014 she wants tech companies to exercise greater control over that marketplace, so that rogue ideas can never spread in the first place.  In other words, Warren doesn\u2019t really oppose corporate censorship. Like many of her Democrat colleagues, she simply wants the\u00a0right kind\u00a0of corporate censorship.

      "subtitle": "FRANCONIA, Grafton County, New Hampshire \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday defended her false claim last week that 18-year-old Michael Brown had been \u201cmurdered\u201d by police in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Speaking to reporters after a town hall event in Franconia, New Hampshire, Warren said that Brown had been unarmed when he was shot \u201cin the middle of the street, by police officers, and left to die.\u201d The 18-year-old Brown, who was unarmed at the time, was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson on August 9, 2014. That much is true. However, left-wing activists falsely claimed at the time that Brown was innocent of any crime; had been shot in the back; and had put his hands over his head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d (hence the slogan, \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot!\u201d). None of those claims turned out to be true \u2014 though they were circulated by Democrats and mainstream journalists. Screenshot / CNN via The Right Scoop The incident revitalized the\u00a0\u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement, bringing focus to claims of police brutality \u2014 but also bringing unrest to many American cities, and prompting police to pull back from fighting crime in black neighborhoods. Race relations, according to Gallup polls, suffered a decline from which they have not recovered. The U.S. Department of Justice under President Barack Obama, after an extensive investigation, found evidence that Brown had not been murdered, and that he had probably attacked Wilson first, reaching for his gun (and shooting his own thumb during the scuffle). Brown had also been charging Wilson later when the shots were fired. The Department of Justice concluded that Officer Wilson\u2019s use of force could not be described as \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d It added: \u201cAccordingly \u2026 it is not appropriate to present this matter to a federal grand jury for indictment, and it should therefore be closed without prosecution. \u201d When a local grand jury likewise declined to induct Wilson, a riot ensued, damaging many minority-owned businesses in Ferguson. The neighborhood has struggled ever since. Warren tweeted last Friday:  Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), also running for president, made a similar claim in a tweet of her own on Friday.\u00a0The\u00a0Washington Post\u2018s left-leaning fact-checker awarded Warren and Harris\u2019s claim that Brown was murdered \u201cFour Pinnochios.\u201d In addition, in response to Warren\u2019s tweet, the\u00a0Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association wrote\u00a0a sharply critical letter, arguing, \u201cYour reckless tweet will only serve to create hatred towards Police Officers and place them in danger of more assaults and perhaps death.\u201d Asked by a reporter for ABC News at a press gaggle after the town hall if she still thought Brown was \u201cmurdered,\u201d Warren refused to retract her claim or to apologize: What happened is that a man was shot \u2014 an unarmed man, in the middle of the street, by police officers, and left to die. And I think that\u2019s where our focus should be. It is the fifth anniversary of that occurring, and we need to talk about how to make real change in this country. I have a more comprehensive plan coming out just a little bit later. Warren, who spoke to a crowd of over 300 in Franconia, is scheduled to continue campaigning in New Hampshire through Wednesday evening. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Of those surveyed, 31 percent named Warren as their Democrat nominee of choice. Joe Biden (D) came in second place with 25 percent support, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) with 17 percent support. The results demonstrate a five-point gain for Warren, who had 26 percent to Biden\u2019s 25 percent in the YouGovUS/CBS News poll taken August 28 \u2013 September 4, 2019. The remaining candidates fell below the well-established top tier. The survey shows Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) down by double digits, with seven percent support. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fifth place with five percent support, and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) came in right behind with four percent support. The remaining candidates saw one percent support or less. The margin of error is +/-\u00a01.6 percent:   Warren also saw a boost in individual states. YouGov surveyed 506 registered Democrats in New Hampshire. Thirty-two percent of those respondents chose Warren as their first choice, followed by Biden with 24 percent and Sanders with 17 percent. The margin of error is +/- 5.4 percent:  The survey showed a tighter race in the early caucus state, Iowa. Of the 729 registered Democrats surveyed, 22 percent chose both Warren and Biden. Sanders came in a close third with 21 percent support, followed by Buttigieg with 14 percent support. The margin of error for the Hawkeye State results is +/- 4.6 percent:  Biden, however, continues to hold a strong lead in South Carolina, with 43 percent of the 915 registered Democrats surveyed choosing the former vice president. He topped his closest competitor, Warren, by 25 percent. She garnered 18 percent, followed by Sanders with 16 percent. The margin of error is +/-3.9 percent:  While Biden still holds the greatest electability, he has experienced a ten-point drop in the last month, falling from 77 percent to 67 percent. Warren\u2019s electability, however, has slightly grown, jumping from 55 percent in September to 56 percent in October. Biden and Warren will face each other on the debate stage alongside ten other candidates at\u00a0Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday evening.",

The science is settled: Elizabeth Warren is a fake Indian. Here\u2019s a quick list of the headlines Warren is dealing with today: Washington Post: \u201cElizabeth Warren angers prominent Native Americans with politically fraught DNA test\u201d CNN: \u201cElizabeth Warren might have actually made things worse with her DNA gambit\u201d CBS News: \u201cElizabeth Warren criticized for releasing DNA report\u201d Politico (Politico!): \u201cWarren stumbles with \u2018Native American\u2019 rollout\u201d HuffPost: \u201cWhy White Americans Love To Claim Native Ancestry\u201d The Hill: \u201cDem strategist says Warren taking DNA test was \u2018tone deaf'\u201d New York Times: Elizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA Results Draw Rebuke from Trump and Raise Questions USA Today: \u201cCherokee Nation slams Sen. Elizabeth Warren DNA test as \u2018inappropriate and wrong'\u201d Boston Globe: Elizabeth Warren Defends Decision to Release DNA Test Compare those headlines to the headlines Monday morning when Warren rolled out her carefully planned assault on Trump using her DNA results. Keep in mind that part of Team Warren\u2019s careful planning involved alerting the media beforehand. This allowed every establishment media outlet to coordinate and execute a plan that would spin this into vindication and a big victory for Warren over Trump. Remember, our establishment media is the communication arm of the Democrat Party, so all of them got the talking points ahead of time and tried diligently to stick to them. All of this is painfully obvious in these Monday morning headlines: ABC News: \u201cElizabeth Warren reveals proof of Native American ancestry\u201d AP: \u201cWarren DNA shows Native American heritage\u201d CNN: \u201cElizabeth Warren releases DNA test with \u2018strong evidence\u2019 of Native American ancestry\u201d BBC: \u201cElizabeth Warren: DNA test finds \u2018strong evidence\u2019 of Native American blood\u201d USA Today: \u201cWarren DNA shows Native American heritage\u201d NBC News: \u201cElizabeth Warren releases DNA results indicating she has Native American heritage\u201d Boston Globe: \u201cWarren Reveals test Confirming Ancestry\u201d Here is my favorite flip-flop\u2026 The far-left Daily Beast on Monday: \u201cBREAKING: Elizabeth Warren releases her DNA test: Yes, she is Native American\u201d The far-left Daily Beast on Wednesday: \u201cElizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA Stunt Alienates Native Americans\u201d Try to imagine Warren on Sunday night. Picture her so excited she cannot sleep, excited because she has planned this out like the invasion of Normandy. She\u2019s got the DNA test proving she might only be 1023/1024 white. She has a slick video that will own Drumpf. She has the establishment media all lined up to do her bidding. The Boston Globe has even agreed to botch the math in her favor. So there she is, lying in the dark grinning, rubbing her hands together, because she can see 2020 from her wigwam. Better still, in her mind\u2019s eye she can see President Trump on defense for days as the media pummel him as an Indian giver over his $1 million bet. Oh, yes, at long last someone will get the best of Drumpf, and it will be me! Me, I tell you! ME! And I will leap to the top of the presidential polls, and destroy Trump in 2020, and be the first woman president and the first Cherokee president and redistribute the wampum and, and, and\u2026 In the immortal words of Bugs Bunny: \u201cSheesh, what a maroon.\u201d Let me tell you the mistake Warren made. Oh, yes, she made quite a few, but here is the Big One \u2013the only one that mattered\u2026 Warren believes she still lives in a world where the establishment media can set the narrative. There is no other explanation for this fiasco. She actually thought that if she lined up the dinosaurs \u2014 the\u00a0Boston Globe, CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post and the rest \u2014 that she could magically get away with passing her junk science off as proof she is not a godless liar. Ten years ago, she probably would have gotten away with it. Today? No way. New Media is just too good at what we do. And it certainly helps when we have the facts on our side, and in the case of Warren\u2019s DNA test, the facts are not only devastating to Warren, they are fatal to her 2020 presidential aspirations. The truth is that Warren\u2019s DNA test \u2014 just like all the documentary evidence of the past \u2014 only proved Warren a liar, a liar with no more Native blood in her than the average white American. She might even have less. And even that is not exactly true because \u2014 get this \u2014 her DNA test did not even use American Indian samples. The samples came from Peru, Mexico, and Colombia. Sure, back in \u201908, just as the media was able to shoot down Barack Obama known associations with racists and domestic terrorists, just as they were able to wrist flick his illegal drug use, they might have been able to put this controversy to bed for Warren \u2014 to declare it old and settled news. But it is not 2008 anymore, and if Warren is incapable of grasping that simple fact, she has no business running for president. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

      "subtitle": "Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) confirmed in a Thursday interview with the New York Times that she supports slavery reparations for American blacks.",
      "author": "Katherine Rodriguez",
      "content": " The New York Times reported that Warren expressed her support for a policy that would pay money to black Americans who have been affected by slavery. Warren\u2019s campaign staff declined to elaborate on how she would support reparations, but the calls for reparations came after she said the federal government should provide financial assistance to residents in poor communities affected by \u201credlining,\u201d a practice where lenders refuse mortgages to people in financially risky areas. Warren is not the first 2020 presidential candidate to call for reparations. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) announced in a Monday radio interview with New York City\u2019s Power 105.1\u2019s \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d that \u201csome type of\u201d reparations should be provided to black Americans impacted by slavery. Harris confirmed her comments calling for reparation in the radio interview with the Times on Thursday. \u201cWe have to be honest that people in this country do not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities,\u201d Harris said in the statement. \u201cI\u2019m serious about taking an approach that would change policies and structures and make real investments in black communities.\u201d Other Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, have not expressed support for this policy. Warren has received a lot of pushback on the campaign trail for her exaggerated claims of Native American ancestry. One heckler at Warren\u2019s campaign rally in Georgia on Saturday yelled, \u201cWhy did you lie?\u201d and held up a \u201c1/2020th\u201d sign before being escorted out of the campaign event. The Massachusetts Democrat released results of a 2018 DNA test which\u00a0revealed\u00a0that she had between 1/64th and 1/1,1024th Native American ancestry after President Donald Trump and other Republicans criticized her for falsely claiming Native American ancestry. Trump has frequently called Warren \u201cPocahontas,\u201d most recently\u00a0using\u00a0the term to refer to Warren after she launched her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination this month. The Massachusetts Democrat\u00a0issued\u00a0an apology in January to the Cherokee Nation for taking the DNA test shortly after the results of the DNA test went public because Cherokee leaders thought modern DNA tests undermined centuries-old laws and traditions defining tribal heritage.",

It has\u00a0dipped from 12.3 percent participation to 10.5 percent over the last decade, according to Illinois Public Media.

In 2012, union membership hit its lowest point since the current data series began in the early 1980s, falling below 14.4 million, before turning modestly upward.

And it\u2019s what I believed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a person of color,\u201d she then conceded. \u201cI\u2019m not a citizen of a tribe and I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Charlamagne, interrupting Warren, then asked if she would claim Native American heritage again if she could do it again. \u201cI can\u2019t go back,\u201d Warren repeated. \u201cBut, I shouldn\u2019t. But what I do is try to be a good partner. And that\u2019s what I do every day.\u201d Warren went on to name drop issues such as health care, student loan debt, and the housing crisis. However, the Breakfast Club hosts were unfazed by Warren\u2019s attempt to pivot away from the controversial subject and continued to press her. \u201cSo what? Your family told you were Native American,\u201d\u00a0DJ Envy asked. \u201cYeah!\u201d Warren exclaimed. \u201cHow long did you hold on to that?\u201d\u00a0Charlamagne asked. \u201cBecause there were some reports that said you were Native American on your Texas Bar license and that you said you were Native American, also documents when you were a professor at Harvard\u2013like, why did you do that?\u201d Warren repeated her initiation response, claiming that she learned of her now-debunked lineage from her family. She failed to provide any date and time on when exactly she found out about her true heritage. Charlamagne\u2019s next, key question went entirely unanswered: \u201cWhen did you find out you weren\u2019t?\u201d Warren sputtered, then replied: \u201cI\u2019m not a person of color. I\u2019m not a citizen of a tribe and tribal citizenship is an important distinction, and not something I am. So\u2026\u201d She left that final sentence unfinished, waiting for another question. \u201cWas there any benefits to that?\u201d\u00a0Charlamagne tha God shot back. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, finding her footing again in a prepared line. \u201cBoston Globe did a full investigation, it never affected anything about my family. It never affected any job I ever got.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the original Rachel\u00a0Dolezal a little bit,\u201d\u00a0Charlamagne quipped. \u201cRachel\u00a0Dolezal is a white woman pretending to be black.\u201d \u201cWell, this is what I learned from my family,\u201d Warren replied, throwing her hands up.",

      "author": "AWR Hawkins",
      "content": " Her gun control, made public in August on Medium, shows Warren believes the current ten percent excise tax on firearms is too low. She wants to raise that tax to 30 percent while increasing the tax on ammunition to 50 percent. Because excise taxes are paid directly by the consumer\u2013the taxes are added to the price of the goods\u2013this means a $500 gun would immediately cost $650 and the price for a $20 box of ammo would immediately rise to $30. Warren claims this taxation policy would \u201cbring in new federal revenue\u201d that can used for \u201cgun violence prevention.\u201d And she simultaneously suggests the tax would raise the price on guns and ammo to a level sufficient to stifle sales. She does not explain how reducing sales via tax policy can bring in new revenue. Rather, she cites\u201dfederal excise tax on cigarettes, domestic wine, or even airline tickets,\u201d to try to bolster justify pushing for more taxes on firearms and bullets.

It\u2019s a danger to the air we breathe. It causes earthquakes. It\u2019s highly explosive. Safe fracking is, like clean coal, pure fiction,\u201d Sanders said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cBut, most importantly, methane from natural gas contributes to climate change and is setting us on a path to disaster,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen we are in the White House, we will end the era of fossil fuels, and that includes fracking\u201d:  Ten Democrat candidates participated in CNN\u2019s seven-hour climate change town hall Wednesday, and many\u00a0signaled support for the implementation of a carbon tax as well as plastic straw bans, actions on meat consumption, and the end of fracking. \u201cThere\u2019s no question I\u2019m in favor of banning fracking,\u201d Sen.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",

Politico reports: Aides to three rival candidates confirmed in interviews they\u2019re revving up opposition research on Warren in preparation for the next debate on Sept. 12. Still others privately complained she\u2019s gotten fawning treatment in the media as she unveiled a litany of ambitious plans without being pressed on where the money would come from to pay for them. Warren\u2019s supporters said the gripes amount to sour grapes from campaigns who didn\u2019t take her seriously until she shot up in the polls, and are now watching with envy the organization she\u2019s amassed while they were busy attacking each other. Her competitors do not want to alienate potential voters in the process. Campaign aides, though, have signaled that their candidates will be ready to attack if Warren chooses to go on offense: An adviser to a competing campaign, who spoke on condition of anonymity, echoed some of that sentiment. If Warren attacks someone else\u2019s record on the debate stage, the person said, she will get it back in return. \u201cNobody else here has been a Republican before,\u201d the adviser said. As Breitbart News previously reported, Warren has been using Sanders as somewhat of a human shield, agreeing with his aggressive proposals \u2013 like Medicare for All and a Green New Deal plan \u2013 but allowing him to take the brunt of the questions and criticisms. As Breitbart News reported: While it is true that most criticisms of Medicare for All have been geared toward Sanders, he has been demonstratively more vocal and honest about his efforts. Warren, however, has yet to provide details of her comprehensive plan, which may explain why she has not had as much of a target on her back. Nonetheless, some campaigns believe that Warren\u2019s momentum will slow, much like Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable: What goes up must come down. It\u2019s the law of political physics,\u201d Joe Biden (D) organizer Dick Harpootlian said, according to Politico. Warren is currently averaging 16.5 percent in the polls and will face nine candidates \u2013\u00a0including Biden, Harris, and Sanders \u2013 on the debate stage in Houston, Texas, September 12.",

      "content": " Colbert asked Warren, a strong advocate for a government-run health care system, if Medicare for All would result in higher taxes for the middle class \u2014 a question she has faced before but has continually refused to answer directly:  \u201cYou keep being asked in the debates \u2018how are you going to pay for it. Are you going to be raising the middle class taxes?'\u201d\u00a0The Late Show host said. \u201cHow are you going to pay for it? Are you going to be raising the middle class taxes?\u201d \u201cSo, here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to do this,\u201d Warren said. \u201cCosts are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations\u2026 and hard-working middle class\u00a0families are going to see their costs going down.\u201d \u201cBut will their taxes go up?\u201d Colbert asked, before offering a suggestion to the presidential candidate on how to better frame the \u201cradical\u201d proposal. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to these answers a few times before, and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you\u2019re not mentioning in your sentence,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cIsn\u2019t Medicare for All like public school? There might be taxes for it, but you certainly save a lot of money sending your kids to school and do you want to live in a world where your kids aren\u2019t educated? Do you want to live in a world where your fellow citizens are dying, even if it costs a little bit of money?\u201d he asked. Despite Colbert\u2019s suggestion, Warren would not directly say if the proposal would result in higher taxes on the middle class. \u201cSo, I accept your point and I believe in your point. Health care is a basic human right. We fight for basic human rights, and that\u2019s Medicare for All. Everyone gets covered,\u201d she said before detailing her history of studying \u201cwhy families go broke\u201d and naming health care costs as one of the primary factors. She continued: I am so deeply grateful to President Obama who moved this country to say, \u2018We as a country want every person here to have health care coverage.\u2019 And now it\u2019s time to take the next step and say let\u2019s do that in the most effective way possible,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAnd what every study shows is that Medicare for All is the cheapest way to do that. And it\u2019s the way to make sure that those who have more will pay more, but that hardworking families will pay less. Nobody has to go bankrupt over health care if we get Medicare for All. Warren dodged a similar question posed during the third Democrat primary debate in Houston, Texas, last week, refusing to say if Medicare for All would result in higher taxes for the middle class. \u201cMiddle class families are going to pay less,\u201d she said during the debate, referring to health care costs, specifically:  \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is what\u2019s going to happen in families\u2019 pockets, what\u2019s going to happen in their budgets, and the answer is, on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations,\u201d the Massachusetts senator continued. \u201cBut for hardworking families across this country costs are going to go down, and that\u2019s how it should work under Medicare for All,\u201d she added.",

We just need to be in a different position on this,\u201d she said, downplaying the number of criminals and drug traffickers who take advantage of the porous border. \u201cIt\u2019s really important on immigration that we concentrate our resources on the people who pose threats to us, and that\u2019s not children,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not mamas fleeing terror from gangs down in Central America. It\u2019s not people trying to build a life who have family here,\u201d she added:  Recent\u00a0U.S. Customs and Border Protection data revealed that two caravans that arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border, in October 2018 and January 2019,\u00a0included \u201c1,520 previously deported illegal aliens who had been convicted of crimes in the U.S.,\u201d Breitbart News reported. Of those: That data only reflects the illegal aliens from those two caravans alone. There are countless stories of illegal alien crime, although many of the stories are largely ignored by the establishment media. In January,\u00a0U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested more than 100 immigration violators in New York. The vast majority of the illegal aliens were convicted criminals. Breitbart News reported:  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) made 188 arrests from January 14-18. Of those arrested, 107 were convicted criminals or facing charges, and 55 failed to leave the country after a final order of removal or were previously removed and returned to the U.S. The following month, a story emerged of an illegal alien mother of nine, Celia Ruiz-Ochoa, who ran a massive drug trafficking ring after settling in the states and passed it down to her son in 2016. She is serving 17 years in federal prison: Federal authorities say Ruiz-Ochoa often trafficked the\u00a0drugs into the U.S. by air and by land. She was so successful that\u00a0she rose to the top of an international drug trafficking ring which contributed to the opioid crisis in Ohio, WCPO\u00a0reported\u00a0Thursday. Additionally, the majority of\u00a0working-class Americans say current immigration policies are driving up crime in the U.S. Breitbart News reported:  The latest Gallup survey finds that among Americans with less than a college degree, more than one-in-two, or 51 percent, said immigration to the U.S. has made crime across the country worse. About 41 percent said immigration has not had much impact on crime, and only seven percent said immigration has decreased crime. Overall, more Americans say immigration is driving up crime than those who say immigration is decreasing crime. About 42 percent of Americans said immigration makes crime worse, while about 50 percent said immigration has no impact on crime. Only seven percent of Americans believe immigration decreases crime. The \u201ccriminal offense\u201d topic bubbled up during the recent Democrat debate, with former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) hitting Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) over his purported support of\u00a0Section 1325. \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear. The reason that they\u2019re separating these little children from their families is that they\u2019re using Section 1325 of that act, which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the parents and then separate them,\u201d Castro said on the debate stage. \u201cSome of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it. Some, like Congressman O\u2019Rourke, have not,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I want to challenge all of the candidates to do that.\u201d Voters can add Warren \u2013 a top tier Democrat candidate \u2013 to the list of candidates who support decriminalizing illegal entry into the United States.

      "subtitle": "Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers assailed proposals from presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to impose a wealth tax.",
      "author": "John Carney",
      "content": " A tax on the wealth of the richest Americans would raise far less money than its proponents claim and would likely exacerbate any problems with the wealthy exercising too much influence over politics, Summers said Thursday at an event at the Peterson Institute for Interna Summers was Treasury Secretary in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration and a top economic adviser to Barack Obama. That makes his critique of the wealth tax proposals from Warren and Sanders particularly relevant for Democrats. Summers said the data put forth by a pair of economists,\u00a0Berkeley professors Emmanuel\u00a0Saez\u00a0and Gabriel Zucman, to support the case for a wealth tax is \u201csubstantially misleading\u201d and \u201csubstantially inaccurate.\u201d He argued on Thursday that it was likely that the wealthy could avoid much of the tax by spreading their wealth around to relatives and by donating it to organizations that would pursue their goals. This could increase their political influence because some of those organizations would likely lobby for policies their donors approve of, Summers said.  \u201cIf you had a successful wealth tax that forced people to react the way they normally would by giving away their money to organizations that share their values and spent money in pursuit of their values, you would in all likelihood increase, rather than decrease, the influence of the views of the wealthy,\u201d Summers argued. Warren has proposed a 2 percent tax\u00a0on wealth that exceeds $50 million, and 3 percent on the amount above $1 billion. \u201cThe arguments around political power have almost no validity,\u201d Summers said. \u201cThe truth is you can become one of the most powerful money people around the Democratic Party or the Republican Party for four or five million dollars a year. Nothing in this world is going to be able stop the wealthiest people in America from being able to come up with a vast multiple of that.\u201d ",

      "subtitle": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday unveiled her plan to address \u201cenvironmental injustice\u201d and \u201cenvironmental racism,\u201d which includes a $1 trillion investment into minority communities affected by \u201cindustrial pollution.\u201d",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren argues that \u201cjustice\u201d plays a massive role in properly addressing the climate change \u201ccrisis,\u201d citing studies that suggest that black and Hispanic families are disproportionately affected by air pollution caused by white people: A more recent study found that while whites largely cause air pollution, Blacks and Latinxs are more likely to breathe it in. Unsurprisingly, these groups also experience higher rates of childhood asthma. And many more low-income and minority communities are exposed to toxins in their water \u2013 including lead and chemicals from industrial and agricultural run-off. Warren calls this phenomenon \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d and concludes that \u201cenvironmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long.\u201d She previewed her plan in a video clip featuring far-left \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). \u201cWe need a government that\u2019s on the side of families\u2014not giant corporations polluting our communities. @RashidaTlaib and I walked through 48217, the most polluted zip code in Michigan, and talked with the families living every day with the effects of pollution,\u201d Warren tweeted alongside the clip:  Like Warren\u2019s other proposals, her environmental injustice plan weaves in aspects of her other campaign promises. For instance, Warren says her housing plan will provide an assistance program, aimed to get impoverished families out of poor, pollution-ridden neighborhoods and into the \u201cneighborhood of their choice.\u201d She also pledges to invest one-third \u2013 or $1 trillion\u00a0\u2013 of her climate change investment \u201cinto the most vulnerable communities,\u201d although she does not specify what the $1 trillion will be spent on, specifically. Like most of Warren\u2019s plans, her environmental injustice proposal involves the implementation of another tax. In this instance, it is the \u201cSuperfund Waste Tax.\u201d Her plan states: There are over 1300 remaining Superfund sites across the country, many located in or adjacent to frontline communities. So-called \u201corphan\u201d toxic waste clean-ups were originally funded by a series of excise taxes on the petroleum and chemical industries. But thanks to Big Oil and other industry lobbyists, when that tax authority expired in 1995 it was not renewed. Polluters must pay for the consequences of their actions \u2013 not leave them for the communities to clean up. I\u2019ll work with Congress to reinstate and then triple the Superfund tax, generating needed revenue to clean up the mess. The presidential hopeful even weaves in Medicare for All as part of her broader proposal, arguing such a system will \u201cmake it easier for the federal government to quickly tailor health care responses to specific environmental disasters in affected communities when they occur.\u201d Warren also reiterates her pledge to \u201censure that employers and our government honor the promises they made to workers in fossil fuel industries.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve fought for years to protect pensions and health benefits for retired coal workers, and I\u2019ll continue fighting to maintain the solvency of multi-employer pension plans,\u201d she said. \u201cAs president, I\u2019ll protect those benefits that fossil fuel workers have earned.\u201d However, Warren\u2019s role in crafting a petition to the Supreme Court on behalf of LTV Steel \u2013 which helped the company\u2019s \u201cfight against a congressional requirement\u00a0 that it pay millions of dollars into a fund for its retired coal miners\u2019 health care\u201d \u2013\u00a0calls her promise into question. \u201cAs I\u2019ve traveled this country, I\u2019ve heard the human stories from frontline communities. Families where many people have cancer. Coastal communities facing the threat of rising sea levels. Ruined land and poisoned water,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cThese communities need justice\u2014and I will stand with them,\u201d she added:    ",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Warren, who is rapidly moving up through the ranks of Democratic Party presidential contenders, has taken increasingly anti-Israel stances in the past several years. She boycotted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress in 2015, and accused Netanyahu of corruption and \u201cembracing right-wing extremism\u201d earlier this year. An activist from the radical left-wing group IfNotNow named Becca Lubow approached Warren in New Hampshire on Monday after a town hall and asked Warren if she would commit to pushing \u201cthe Israeli government to end Occupation.\u201d Warren answered, \u201cYes. Yes. So I\u2019m there.\u201d  In a statement, IfNotNow described, and applauded, what it described as Warren\u2019s increasingly \u201cprogressive\u201d stance on Israel:  The word \u201coccupation\u201d was not defined. Some anti-Israel activists consider the very existence of Israel to be an \u201coccupation.\u201d IfNotNow is a fringe group that began in the midst of Israel\u2019s war against the Palestinian terror group Hamas in 2014 \u2014 a war for which Hamas was almost universally blamed, and in which Hamas fired rockets at civilian population centers. As Breitbart News noted earlier this year (original links): IfNotNow seeks to disrupt the connections that many American Jewish organizations have with Israel. It blames American Jewish support for Israel for the persistence of the Israeli occupation of Judea and Samaria (the West Bank), though most Palestinians in that territory live under the administration of the Palestinian Authority. In addition to staging sit-ins and protests, members of IfNotNow attempt to infiltrate Jewish summer camps and tours of Israel, where they launch demonstrations or expose the mainstream Jewish community to anti-Israel propaganda. In one episode in 2018, members of IfNotNow were arrested while reciting the Kaddish \u2014 the traditional Jewish prayer for the dead \u2014 near the offices of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, memorializing Palestinians killed in \u201cprotests\u201d at the Gaza border. (The vast majority of Palestinians killed were members of Hamas, and they were trying to infiltrate Israel to carry out attacks, not stage a non-violent protest against Israeli policies.) Recently, IfNotNow supported Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) after she repeatedly used antisemitic rhetoric. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The DC Council approved of the \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day Emergency Declaration Act of 2019\u201d last week, which temporarily replaces Columbus Day with \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day\u201d in the city this year. However, it is not a permanent measure:  Council member David Grosso said last week: \u201cColumbus Day was officially designated as a federal holiday in 1937, despite the fact Columbus did not discover North America, despite the fact millions of people were already living in North America upon his arrival to the Americas, and despite the fact Columbus never set foot on the shores of the current United States. \u2026 Columbus enslaved, colonized, mutilated, and massacred thousands of Indigenous People in the Americas. Warren, who falsely claimed Native American heritage throughout her academic career, embraced the temporary replacement. \u201cThe story of America\u2019s mistreatment of indigenous peoples is long and painful. And yet, Native communities have proven resilient,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cWe owe them our respect\u2014and we must honor our government\u2019s commitments and promises to them,\u201d she added with the hashtag, \u201c#IndigenousPeoplesDay\u201d:  Warren also\u00a0provided a link to her extensive plan focused on \u201chonoring and empowering tribal nations and Indigenous peoples\u201d:  The presidential hopeful unveiled her comprehensive plan to \u201cempower\u201d tribal nations in August, which included key pieces from her other plans. She promised to expand federally protected land, sign a \u201cset of executive orders to hold private contractors accountable for pay equity,\u201d and provide Medicare for All. Warren has faced scrutiny for falsely claiming Native American heritage in the past. The results of her DNA test made public last year showed that she possessed between 1/64th and 1/1,024 Native American ancestry (or between 0.1 percent to 1.56 percent). The results called her past claims of Native American heritage \u2013 Cherokee heritage, specifically \u2013 into question. Not only had Warren identified as a minority professor for years, she also claimed Native American\u00a0heritage on her\u00a0Texas Bar registration card and once cited her high cheekbones as proof of her native roots. A clip of an interview from 2012 shows the presidential hopeful telling a reporter that she had pictures proving her Native American family history, but she refused to show them. \u201cI have plenty of pictures. They\u2019re not for you,\u201d Warren told the reporter:  As Breitbart News reported, Warren\u2019s DNA results did not show a direct association with Native American tribes in the U.S., further debunking her claims of Cherokee heritage. Warren has failed to explain why she went so many years claiming minority status without checking her family history, but she has since admitted that she is \u201cnot a citizen of a tribe\u201d and issued a general\u00a0apology for making what she described as a \u201cmistake.\u201d \u201cLike anyone who\u2019s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,\u201d Warren\u00a0said\u00a0at the Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, in August. \u201cI am sorry for harm I have caused.\u201d Warren will join 11 other candidates on the debate stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday evening. The Massachusetts senator\u2019s false claims of Native American heritage have yet to become a topic of conversation at any of the primary debates.",

County records published by the Washington Free Beacon on Monday confirm that Warren resigned and was never fired. The Free Beacon\u2019s Collin Anderson reported: RIVERDALE, N.J.\u2014The Riverdale Board of Education approved a\u00a0second-year teaching contract\u00a0for a young Elizabeth Warren, documents show, contradicting the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s repeated claims that she was asked not to return to teaching\u00a0after a\u00a0single\u00a0year because she was \u201cvisibly pregnant.\u201d Minutes of an April 21, 1971, Riverdale Board of Education meeting obtained by the Washington Free Beacon show that\u00a0the board voted unanimously on a motion to extend Warren a \u201c2nd year\u201d contract for a two-days-per-week teaching job. That job is similar to the one she held the previous year, her first year of teaching. Minutes from a board meeting held two months later, on June 16, 1971, indicate that Warren\u2019s resignation was \u201caccepted with regret.\u201d In fact, the minutes show that far from being fired, Warren had been unanimously approved for a second year:  The minutes also confirm a key detail from the 2007 interview: namely, that Warren was hired on an \u201cemergency\u201d basis because she lacked the necessary education qualifications, despite graduating from George Washington University with a degree in speech pathology, and supposedly pursuing a lifelong dream of being a public school teacher. In the course of her presidential campaign, Warren has repeatedly told the nation a very different story \u2014 one in which an old-fashioned male principal discriminated against her because of her pregnancy. In the second presidential debate in Detroit, for example, Warren said: \u201c[A]t the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant.

So, when I\u2019m president, she\u2019ll be gone.\u201d Before closing, Warren indicated that she would like to have Jacob vet who she chooses as the secretary of education in her administration. \u201cI want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story, and then I want you to tell me if you think that\u2019s the right person and then we\u2019ll make the deal,\u201d Warren said. Jacob smiled and gave Warren a thumbs up as he took his seat. Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.",

He has made one racist remark after another. He has put in place racist policies, and we\u2019ve seen the consequences of it,\u201d she continued, seemingly bashing Trump supporters by calling those who \u201ccelebrate\u201d and support the president \u201chateful.\u201d \u201cPeople who are hateful feel like they are now in power,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThey are protected. They celebrate this president.\u201d \u201cThis has turned America in a terrible direction, and Donald Trump keeps it going,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be clear. A Republican Congress, Republican leadership in Washington \u2013 they got nothing to say about it. And that means they just help strengthen it. They help it keep moving right along,\u201d she added. While she agreed with Lemon that Trump needs to be more \u201cforceful\u201d in condemning white supremacy, she was among critics who dismissed Trump\u2019s most recent forceful rebuke. \u201cIt is the responsibility to the President of the United States to help fight back against that\u2013 not to wink and nod and smile at it,\u201d she said:   Despite Warren\u2019s assertion, Trump did not \u201cwink and nod and smile\u201d at the carnage that shook the two communities over the weekend. He addressed the American people Monday morning and forcefully condemned \u201csinister ideologies\u201d like white supremacism and racism, just as Warren requested. \u201cIn one voice our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThese sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America\u201d:  While it is true that the El Paso gunman allegedly posted an anti-immigration manifesto filled with bigoted vitriol, the writer said his twisted thoughts predated Trump. The Dayton shooter, on the other hand, was an avowed leftist who seemingly supported Antifa and held anti-ICE, anti-police, and anti-Second Amendment views, according to a Twitter account linked to the gunman. He also had a liking for Warren herself, writing in one tweet that he would \u201chappily\u201d vote for the Massachusetts senator. Warren has not delved into the Dayton shooter\u2019s purported support for her.\u00a0Rather, the mainstream media have rallied behind her, urging critics to refrain from implicating Warren. Warren is not the only candidate to dismiss Trump\u2019s swift condemnation. Fellow 2020 candidates pounced following his remarks, continuing to accuse him of fostering a negative environment conducive to white supremacy:    ",

And yes, a famous geneticist analyzed my DNA and concluded that it contains Native American ancestry.\u00a0pic.twitter.com/r3SNzP22f8 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren)\u00a0October 15, 2018    The DNA results did not bode well for Warren, despite her initial victory lap. The results showed that she possessed between\u00a01/64th and 1/1024th Native American ancestry, or\u00a0between 0.1 percent to 1.56 percent. Additionally, the results indicated that Warren\u2019s minuscule Native American links were not associated with tribes in the United States, further casting doubt on her claims of Cherokee heritage. President Trump pounced on the results. \u201cPocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed,\u201d he wrote on October 16, 2018. \u201cShe took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her, \u2018DNA test is useless.\u2019 Even they don\u2019t want her. Phony!\u201d he added:  \u201cA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship,\u201d Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. said. \u201cCurrent DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person\u2019s ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\u201d: Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. It makes a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is prove. Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage. The results followed Warren\u2019s years of false Native American claims. She listed herself as a minority professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Harvard Law School and claimed Native American\u00a0heritage on her\u00a0Texas Bar registration card. She continued to tout false claims of Native American heritage into her 2012 senatorial bid, telling a reporter that she had pictures that reflected her Native American heritage but added, \u201cI have plenty of pictures. They\u2019re not for you,\u201d leaving the purported evidence shrouded in mystery:  That same year, Warren told the story of her parents, claiming that her father\u2019s parent\u2019s disapproved of her mother because she \u2013 as Warren claimed \u2013 was part Cherokee and Delaware. \u201cIf your family heritage had an African American like you have, the grandfather or great grandparent who was a Cherokee, would you call yourself a black, and expect African Americans to accept that?\u201d New England Cable News\u2019s Jim Braude asked Warren. \u201cIf that same ancestor was black and not Cherokee,\u201d he added. \u201cIf my Father\u2019s parents had said, \u2018You can\u2019t marry her because she\u2019s black, and that had been part of our family growing up, that we had two different families?\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou would be comfortable with saying you\u2019re black?\u201d Braude asked. \u201cIt would be part of identification,\u201d Warren quipped:  While Warren has failed to offer an explicit and thorough explanation for her years of misleading claims, she has vaguely apologized for making a \u201cmistake\u201d and admitted that she is \u201cnot a person of color\u201d and \u201cnot a citizen of a tribe.\u201d \u201cLike anyone who\u2019s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,\u201d Warren said at the Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, in August. \u201cI am sorry for harm I have caused\u201d:  Warren\u2019s campaign deleted the results of her DNA test from her campaign website in August.",
