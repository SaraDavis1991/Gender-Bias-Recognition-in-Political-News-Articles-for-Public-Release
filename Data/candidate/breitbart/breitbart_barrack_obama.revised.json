      "subtitle": "Actor R. Lee Ermey, who died at 74 of pneumonia Sunday morning, was Exhibit A in the New Hollywood Blacklist. After criticizing Barack Obama in 2010, Ermey\u2019s thriving film career immediately dried up. Even after apologizing, he was ostracized, fired by GEICO insurance and never did another commercial. After disappearing completely for a few years, he managed to appear in a couple of C-grade reality shows in the last few years of his life.",
      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " Iconic and talented, Ermey was a walking-talking example of left-wing Hollywood\u2019s intolerance toward those they condemn as thought criminals. Ermey, who was known to his friends as \u201cGunny,\u201d enlisted in the Marines in 1961 when he was only 17, and spent 14 months in Vietnam before earning a honorable discharge after 11 years of service. His screen career began in 1978 with a small role as a drill instructor in The Boys In Company C. He also appeared as a helicopter pilot in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s Apocalypse Now (1979). Some lean years followed, but Ermey\u2019s career exploded in 1987 with Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Full Metal Jacket where Ermey was unforgettable (to say the least) as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, a drill instructor who pushes a recruit (Vincent D\u2019 Onfrio) too far.  Ermey was only supposed to be a technical advisor for Kubrick, but he asked for an audition and not only nailed the role, the famously finicky and precise director went so far as to allow Ermey to improvise. Inside Kubrick\u2019s intentionally sterile and hypnotic world that is the first half of Full Metal Jacket,\u00a0Ermey\u2019s masterpiece of a performance is not only a harbinger of the hell to come in the second half, but the first half\u2019s humanity \u2014 in ways both good and bad, funny and menacing, father figure and monster. Ermey says he voted for Barack Obama in 2008, but in 2010 he was blacklisted in Hollywood (no one disputes this)\u00a0for souring on and then publicly criticizing the president. Over his personal political opinion, he was also fired as a commercial spokesman for GEICO insurance. Here is what Ermey said that cost him his career. While you\u2019re reading this, remember all the vile things Hollywood has said about Trump, including Avengers director Joss Whedon wishing Trump dead: We\u2019re having a big problem this year. The economy really sucks. Now I really hate to point fingers at anybody, but the present [Obama] administration probably has a lot to do with it. And the way I see, they aren\u2019t going to quit doing it until they bring this country to its knees. So I think we should all rise up and we should stop this administration from what they\u2019re doing, because they are destroying this country.\u00a0 They\u2019re driving us into bankruptcy so that they can impose socialism on us. That\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re doing, and I\u2019m sick and damn tired of it and I know you are too. But I know the Maince Corps\u2019 gunna be here forever and this administration won\u2019t. \u00a0\u00a0\u2013 December 10, 2010 \u2013 video. On his website, Ermey apologized for these comments the following month. \u201cI regret that I delivered a monologue that was inappropriately critical of the President. My comments were misguided and emotionally biased, and for that I am truly sorry,\u201d he wrote. But it was too late. Intolerant Hollywood would never forgive him. His film career immediately dried up. What followed were two reality shows, one on the Outdoor Channel, the other on Lifetime. The good news is that before left-wing Hollywood blacklisted him, Ermey had a pretty good run., including Mississippi Burning (1988), Toy Soldiers (1990), Toy Story 1,2,3 (1995 \u2013 2010), The Frighteners (1996), a hilarious turn in the horribly under-appreciated\u00a0Saving Silverman (2000), Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), and countless television appearances. Here are some of his best personal quotes. \u201cIf you\u2019re a conservative in this town [Hollywood], you better watch out.\u201d \u2013 video. \u201cI\u2019m an Independent, but I said something bad about the president. I had something unsavory to say about the president\u2019s administration, and even though I did vote for him the first time around, I was blackballed \u2026 \u00a0Do you realize I have not done a movie in five to six years? Why? Because I was totally blackballed by the\u2026 liberals in Hollywood. They can destroy you. They\u2019re hateful people [who] don\u2019t just not like you, they want to take away your livelihood\u2026 that\u2019s why I live up in the desert on a dirt road\u2026 I don\u2019t have to put up with their crap.\u201d \u2013 video. \u201cI don\u2019t have any respect at all for the scum-bags who went to Canada to avoid the draft or to avoid doing their fair share.\u201d \u201cYou can take a man out of the Corps, but you can\u2019t take the Corps out of the man.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty fun ride, to tell you the truth.\u201d \u201d I know that if Trump were to be elected, I know that our Second Amendment rights are solid as a rock for four years, or whatever his term might be. Donny Trump is on my shooting team, by the way.\u00a0 He\u2019s a heckuva shot. \u201d \u2013 video. Ermey is survived by his wife of 43 years, Nila, who he referred to as \u201cMrs. Gunny.\u201d They had four children. Ermey is also survived by a second-to-none performance in Full Metal Jacket that will be remembered long after the fascist monsters who blacklisted him are worm food.

      "content": "  A partial transcript is as follows: CNN HOST JOHN BERMAN: There was a lot of focus of things that took place in the eight years when [former President Obama] was in office, and he was not necessarily painted in a flattering way [during\u00a0Wednesday\u2019s Democrat debate]. One of the things you hear this morning is if Barack Obama was too far right or not connected to today\u2019s Democratic Party; what does it say about today\u2019s Democratic Party? I\u2019m just telling you what we\u2019re hearing. SEN. CORY BOOKER: Well, first of all, I miss Obama.\u00a0And I miss her husband, too. Look, he [Obama] is our statesman\u2026 He ain\u2019t perfect. Nobody\u2019s ever pulled that off. Nobody has ever pulled that off. And I\u2019m sure if Barack Obama was sitting here \u2014 and I hope he\u2019s sleeping this morning\u00a0\u2014 he would tell you, \u201cI\u2019ve made some mistakes\u2026\u201d Donald Trump\u00a0is a guy that my Republican colleagues can\u2019t even criticize when he\u2019s preaching racism\u2026 We are having an honest conversation about an administration that was incredible. I would take him back.\u00a0Heck, if [Obama] was running for president for a third term, I wouldn\u2019t be running. The reality is we have a situation right now where the president is doing things to this country that are perverting our very values and ideals, and talking about what our plans would be, different from the previous president; different from the current president, is not a bad thing.",

      "subtitle": "Former President Barack Obama derided the American nationalism of President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters as rooted in a \u201chatred\u201d of foreigners, offering his remarks on Tuesday at Rice University in Houston, Texas. He joined former Secretary of State James Baker and presidential biographer Jon Meacham.",
      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " Obama said: We did not adapt quickly enough to the fact that there were people being left behind [by globalization] and that frustrations were going to flare up and that all these changes were happening really quickly, and you had to address them and speak to them. In those environments, you then start getting a different kind of politics. You start getting politics that\u2019s based on, \u201cThat person\u2019s not like me, and it must be their fault,\u201d and you start getting a politics based on a nationalism that\u2019s not pride in country, but hatred for somebody on the other side of the border, and you start getting the kind of politics that does not allow for compromise because it\u2019s based on passions and emotions and identities. When I hear people say they don\u2019t like identity politics, I think it\u2019s important to remember that identity politics doesn\u2019t just apply when it\u2019s black people or gay people or women. The folks who really originated identity politics were the folks who sad three-fifths clause and all that stuff. That was identity politics. That\u2019s still out there. Jim Crow was identity politics. That\u2019s where it started. WATCH:  Obama lamented the news media diversification following the rise of the Internet. He said a \u201ccommon set of facts\u201d \u2014 previously delivered by consensus via the Associated Press, Washington Post, New York Times, ABC, CBS, and NBC \u2014 was lost following the arrival of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News on the news media landscape. He said: There are a range of reasons why [\u201cthe overlapping ideological spectrum in each party\u201d] changed. Some of it had to do with, frankly, the shift in the media because in 1981, your news cycle was still governed by the stories that were going to be filed by AP, the Washington Post, maybe the New York Times, and the three broadcast stations. Whether it was Cronkite or Brinkley, or what have you, there was a common set of facts, a baseline around which both parties had to adapt and respond to, and by the time I take office, what you increasingly have is a media environment in which if you are a Fox News viewer, you have an entirely different reality than if you are a New York Times reader. It means the basis of each respective party [has] become more ideological. WATCH:  Obama also said Trump lacks \u201creverence\u201d for the Oval Office: When I walked into the Oval Office, there\u2019s a reverence there for that office that is independent of you, and if you don\u2019t feel that, then you shouldn\u2019t be there because a lot of fights, a lot of sacrifices, a lot of bloodshed is represented in that office \u2014 not just soldiers in Iwo Jima. It\u2019s maids in Selma, workers in a coal mine. It\u2019s farmers in the Dust Bowl. You\u2019re carrying that vessel, and I never lost that reverence for that office, and every day I would come, and I would say, \u201cI\u2019m going to make mistakes. There are going to be decisions that are compromises.\u201d \u2026 Through all those ups and downs, you had to have a part of you \u2014 and the Bushes had that, and Ronald Reagan had that, and Bill Clinton had that \u2014 that sense of, \u201cThis is sacred. This is important.\u201d And there\u2019s a civic religion and a set of ideals and principles that we won\u2019t get perfect, but we should strive to perfect, and that is something I never lost throughout the time I was there. Both Meacham and Obama refused to say Trump\u2019s name, despite both referring to him implicitly. \u201cHe\u2019s Voldemort. I\u2019m not going to say his name,\u201d Meacham said of Trump while asking Obama a question about Trump\u2019s presidency. Neither Baker nor Meacham challenged Obama\u2019s comments.

      "content": " \u201cPresident Obama has long said that selecting Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made,\u201d Obama said in a statement released through his spokeswoman Katie Hill. \u201cHe relied on the Vice president\u2019s knowledge, insight, and judgment throughout both campaign and the entire presidency. The two forged a special bond over the last 10 years and remain close today.\u201d Biden formally joined the crowded Democrat presidential contest on Thursday, declaring the soul of the nation at stake if President Donald Trump wins re-election. In a\u00a0video posted on Twitter, Biden focused on the 2017 deadly clash between white supremacists and far-left counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia. He repeated the hoax claim that President Trump praised the former group as \u201cvery fine people.\u201d  \u201cWe are in the battle for the soul of this nation,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation \u2014 who we are. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen.\u201d The 76-year-old Biden becomes an instant front-runner alongside Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is leading many polls and has proved to be\u00a0a successful fundraiser. Despite his status within crowded Democrat field, the former vice president already faces several challenges, including fundraising and flaring tensions within his campaign. The New York Times\u00a0reported this week that Biden will enter the race with zero campaign dollars and will need to raise at least $100,000 per day until Christmas if he wants to match the amount of cash that Sanders (I-VT) banked by April 1st. Team Biden is said to be concerned that the 76-year-old may not be able to raise the type of money Sanders and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) did in the first days of their campaigns \u2014 roughly $6 million each. According to the TIME\u00a0magazine, some close to Biden are worried that his 2020 preparations had thus far largely been a failure.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything so half-assed,\u201d one former Biden aide\u00a0said last week.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re improvising and doing last-minute planning. The guy has been running for President since 1987 and can\u2019t figure the basics out, like where to stand on his first day? This should make everyone very nervous.\u201d The AP contributed to this report.",

      "content": " While the state of the Democratic Party in 2020 may make some Republicans cringe, it could pay off in the long run for Republicans according to Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL). During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio\u2019s WVNN on Thursday, Rogers speculated that if former President Barack Obama were one of the candidates in the 2020 Democratic presidential field, he would not win the party nomination for not being \u201csocialist enough.\u201d \u201cI hear it everywhere I go in my district \u2013 people do see them as the face of the future Democrat Party, and they see these presidential debates, and they see how far left they\u2019re going with their rhetoric,\u201d Rogers said on \u201cThe Jeff Poor Show.\u201d \u201cI just spoke to a civic group in Alex City today at lunch, and I told them \u2013 and I really mean this \u2013 Barack Obama could not win the nomination in this year\u2019s Democrat field. He is not socialist enough to win. That\u2019s how far left they\u2019ve moved. So yeah, when I hear Omar and AOC and Tlaib all talking, I want them to keep it up because it is turning off Americans from coast to coast.\u201d Rogers was still optimistic about Republicans chances of picking up the House in 2020 and warned not to read too much into the recent wave of Republican retirements. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any effect on it,\u201d he added. \u201cOne of the things that drives me nuts about the national news media is they spin these things to support a narrative they\u2019re promoting. The fact that is we\u2019re not having a larger retirement than we usually have.\u00a0 If you take the last three-and-a-half years and you compare it to the previous three-and-a-half years, it\u2019s the same percentage. Every August recess, we have a lot of people announce they\u2019re retiring in part because they get back home in August and realize \u2018I like being home. I don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\u2019 It\u2019s a tough way of life. There\u2019s a lot of time away from your family. A lot of time spent fundraising. Social media has made it just a nightmare to have to be in these jobs because people just beat the crap out of you constantly, cable news. A lot of folks just don\u2019t want to do this for a long time.\u201d \u201cBut this is nothing out of the ordinary,\u201d he continued. \u201cOne of the things I would urge your audience to look at in the future because I\u2019ve been doing this 17 years now, and I\u2019ve seen this pattern: Every August, especially right at the end of August you get a lot of people announce they\u2019re retiring because they\u2019ve been home for a month and they like being out of Washington and back home. And then after every Christmas break, we have a wave of announcements for the same reason \u2013 people are back home with their family. They realize they like the private life and they want to go back to it. So there is nothing unusual about what\u2019s happening right now.\u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",

Architects\u00a0Tod Williams and Billie Tsien noted that Obama declined to do a lot of fundraising for the center while in office, and said the reason the center would be so expensive was because of the high cost of building both a library and a museum. The architects say the originally estimated cost of the buildings at $200 million is more likely to be closer to $300 million. Another reason for the higher price tag is because recent federal regulations require that former presidents have larger endowments to pay for annual operating costs at the libraries. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about preserving the past.

But more than what we did, I\u2019m proud of how they\u2019re continuing to fight for an America that\u2019s better,\u201d Obama, who has largely remained silent about the Trump presidency, wrote on Twitter.  In a\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0op-ed published Friday, the ex-Obama administration members wrote they \u201cwitnessed firsthand the relentless attacks on the legitimacy of President Barack Obama and his family\u201d from their \u201cfront-row seats to America\u2019s first black presidency.\u201d The op-ed reads: Witnessing racism surge in our country, both during and after Obama\u2019s service and ours, has been a shattering reality, to say the least. But it has also provided jet-fuel for our activism, especially in moments such as these. We\u2019ve heard this before. Go back where you came from. Go back to Africa.

They are part of a pattern in our country designed to denigrate us as well as keep us separate and afraid. The Obama-era officials then expressed support for the four progressive lawmakers, accusing President Trump of being\u00a0\u201ccomplicit in the poisoning of our democracy.\u201d \u201cWe stand with congresswomen Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, as well as all those currently under attack by President Trump. There is truly nothing more un-American than calling on fellow citizens to leave our country,\u201d the wrote. Earlier this month, President Trump challenged the \u201cSquad\u201d to leave the U.S., citing their frequent verbal attacks on the country, writing on Twitter: \u201cWhy don\u2019t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done.\u201d During a recent campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, President Trump\u2019s supporters broke out into a \u201csend her back\u201d chant about Omar, sending Democrats and the establishment media into a tizzy. The president later said he was \u201cnot happy\u201d about the chants, and Vice President Mike Pence suggested the president may stop them in the future. Absent from the op-ed was any mention of various inflammatory and antisemitic comments made by the \u201cSquad.\u201d Omar has repeatedly sparked political firestorms for her anti-Israel comments and pushing anti-Jewish tropes. The Minnesota Democrat has suggested pro-Israel advocacy groups bribe members of Congress to support the Jewish state. In a 2012 tweet, Omar claimed\u00a0Israel\u00a0had \u201chypnotized the world.\u201d Tlaib has attacked opponents of the anti-Israel BDS movement by claiming, \u201cthey forgot what country they represent,\u201d inferring they hold foreign allegiances. In May, the Michigan Democrat\u00a0said\u00a0Palestinians provided \u201csafe haven\u201d for Jews following the Holocaust. However, it is widely known\u00a0Palestinian leaders, including former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Hajj Muhammad Amin Al-Husseini, collaborated openly with Adolf Hitler. She has also met with Abbas Hamideh, a Hezbollah supporter who has described Israel as a \u201cterrorist entity.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez has come under fire for trivializing the Holocaust by comparing immigrant detention centers to concentration camps. Senior White House advisor Stephen Miller, who is Jewish, recently criticized the New York Democrat for likening the two, saying they\u00a0minimized the \u201cdeath of six million of my Jewish brothers and sisters.\u201d",

      "author": "AWR Hawkins",
      "content": " Obama offered his thoughts during a May 30, 2019, speech while participating in\u00a0VTEX DAY in San Paulo, Brazil. The Daily Mail quoted Obama saying, \u201cGun laws in the United States don\u2019t make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon, anytime without, you know, without much if any regulation. They can buy over the Internet. They can buy machine guns.\u201d There are\u00a0 number of problems with Obama\u2019s claims. The first is the assertion anybody \u201ccan buy any weapon, anytime\u2026without much if any regulation.\u201d This is simply untrue. Firearms are highly regulated in the U.S. via background checks for retail point of sales, registration requirements in states like California and New York, and mandated waiting periods for gun purchases in numerous states as well. Down Range with AWR Hawkins.  Sign up today! Moreover, possession of a firearm is highly regulated requiring Firearm Owners Identication (FOID) cards or other licensing schemes in various states. One cannot even possess a gun in his home without such a card in states like Illinois or without first getting a certificate from the government in states like California. Obama\u2019s claim that guns can be purchased over the internet is spurious as well as it is legal for retailers to advertise and accept payment for a gun over the internet but they cannot ship a gun directly to a buyer. Rather, the gun has to be shipped to a Federal Firearm License holder (FFL) near the buyer so a background check can be performed before the buyer is allowed to take possession of the gun. Lastly, Obama suggested it is easy to buy machine guns in the U.S. He made this statement in the context of talking about the December 14, 2012, attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School, in which machine guns were not used. Nevertheless, Obama broached the subject but did not mention that machine guns are regulated under the National Firearms Act (1934), which means the purchase of one requires a background check, the submission of fingerprints and photographs, the payment of a $200 federal tax, and registering with the weapon with the federal bureaucracy. This process takes eight to nine months to complete. Moreover, the only machine guns that legally be purchased are those built prior to May 1986, therefore there is a limited number of them available. This means the cost of such a weapon often runs in the tens of thousands. Obama did not mention any of these things when suggesting machine guns are too easy to buy in America.

Trump thanked Mexico for stepping up to help enforce the borders, sending 15,000 troops. \u201cI just want to thank Mexico, they\u2019ve really done a great job,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe appreciate what they are doing.\u201d The president again asked Democrats to help close the asylum loopholes that were encouraging migrants to cross into the United States for economic reasons. \u201cPeople want to flow up to the United States, but you just can\u2019t do it that way, you have to do it legally,\u201d he said.",

Trump also noted Obama backing down from his infamous \u201cred line\u201d on the use of chemical weapons in Syria and his failure to keep Russia from annexing Crimea. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming him, but a lot of bad things happened with President Putin and President Obama,\u201d Trump said.

Trump said he was willing to welcome Putin back to the summit, despite past aggressive actions in Europe, and said that other world leaders agreed with him. \u201cI think it would better to have Russia inside the tent than outside the tent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDo we live either way? Yes, we live either way.\u201d",

Trump said he thought Obama was \u201chiding\u201d and raised the possibility that Obama was aware of the efforts from former FBI agents Lisa Page and Peter Strzok to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Partial transcript as follows: you know, I want to ask a question that I haven\u2019t heard you answer. And that is, where is Barack Obama in all this? Why haven\u2019t we heard from him? I mean, in the beginning of your administration, he wouldn\u2019t stop talking. And now, he\u2019s nowhere to be heard. Where is he? TRUMP: I think he\u2019s hiding. PIRRO: Why? TRUMP: I think he knows all about it. And we are talking about investigate the investigators. We\u2019re talking about the beginning. And it was really before I took office. It was \u2014 if you look at the insurance policy with Strzok and Page, just in case she should lose, we\u2019ve got an insurance policy. That\u2019s what all this stuff has been about, the insurance policy. These are bad people. These are evil people. And this was the insurance policy. The two lovers, Strzok and Page. Two beauties. (LAUGHTER) PIRRO: Well, you know \u2026 TRUMP: And it\u2019s a terrible thing, what they do to this country. Terrible. But we are winning. And we\u2019re winning big. And the American public knows it. And that\u2019s why I think they want to stay away. But they can do whatever they want. But they want to stay away. If you look at what\u2019s happening, Jeanine, if you take a look, the electricity for the Republican Party, they are so angry at what has taken place. Because, as an example, everybody knows that Schiff \u2014 we call him \u201cshifty Schiff\u201d \u2014 he made up the story. He made up my phone call. PIRRO: Right. TRUMP: And based on that phone call, this is what this whole thing is about. It\u2019s all about a phone call. And the call is perfect. I have given that call to everybody to read it.

      "content": " In other news, what we have here is yet another example of just how determined the Washington Post and the rest of the media are to live in their own heads; because they don\u2019t even realize what a dazzling self-own this report is. Seriously, think about it: the Washington Post \u201cbombshell\u201d on President Trump updating Obama\u2019s golf simulator, and doing so with his own money, just proves once again how useless and corrupt the establishment media are. Gee, what a crack team of inspiring investigative journalists America is blessed with. At long last, even though he has been out of office for two years, we have finally been told Barry had a golf simulator installed in the White House. And this is real news, because it is a first. Before Barry, there had never been a golf simulator in the White House. So it was Bill Ayers\u2019 Friend who set a national precedent, and thanks to a dogged and persistent Washington Post, we now know this truth, we finally have all the facts, because democracy dies in darkness n\u2019 stuff. But with its stupid bombshell about Trump\u2019s golf simulator, all the far-left Post is doing is admitting it did not report on Obama\u2019s golf simulator, is admitting that were it not for the Post\u2019s obsessive hatred of Trump, the public never would have learned about Obama\u2019s golf simulator. Jimmy Carter made a point of posing as a workaholic and look at the job he did, so as someone who only cares about results and could not care less about how much time a Obama or Trump play golf or vacation or enjoy \u201cexecutive time,\u201d my only takeaway from the from the Post bombshell was: Look at what it takes to force the corrupt media to report on something they did not want us to know about Obama. If the installation of golf simulators at the White House is such a big deal \u2014 and anyone looking at today\u2019s media coverage can only assume it is a Watergate-level Big Deal \u2014 why are we just finding out now that Obama not only enjoyed a golf simulator but was the first president in history to install one? We all know the answer: the Washington Post, along with the rest of the unethical and inept corporate media, had no curiosity when it comes to Obama; and when the media did accidently discover something out about Obama they did not want the public to know, the media covered it up \u2014 like this photo of Obama hanging out with anti-Semitic hate preacher Louis Farrakhan. My guess, and it is a safe one, is that almost everyone in the national political media knew about Obama\u2019s golf simulator but chose to not report because they knew his critics would have a field day with it. And so, if you read between the lines. all the Washington Post reported on yesterday, all the Washington Post revealed with its big scoop about Trump\u2019s golf simulator, is just how awful, unreliable, biased, lazy, and worthless the media have always been.

      "content": " Biden, speaking at\u00a0Dartmouth College in Hanover, was comparing Obama to Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated by Palestinian radical Sirhan Sirhan on June 6, 1968, mere moments after winning the California Democratic Primary, virtually assuring him the party\u2019s nomination. He also drew parallels to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1968. According to the New York Times, Biden\u2019s full quote was as follows: I think of where we are at the moment. You know, none of you men are old \u2014 women are old enough, but a couple of you guys are old enough to remember. I graduated in 1968. Everybody before me was, drop out, go to Haight-Ashbury, don\u2019t trust anybody over 30, everybody not getting involved. I\u2019m serious, I know no woman will shake their head and acknowledge it, but you guys know what I\u2019m talking about. Right? But then what happened? Dr. Ki\u2014 I only have two political heroes. I have one hero who was my dad, but I have two political heroes were Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy. My senior semester they were both shot and killed. Imagine what would have happened if, God forbid, Barack Obama had been assassinated after becoming the de facto nominee. What would have happened in America? Biden also compared the eassassinations of Kennedy and King to the election of President Donald Trump in 2016 in terms of the effect those events had on inspiring left-wing activists. \u201cUnless I\u2019m mistaken, Donald Trump did for your generation what the loss of two of my heroes did for mine,\u201d he said, according to the Times, adding, \u201cWhat they did was make you realize, my God, we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Biden also came under criticism Friday for a gaffe in which he accidentally said his health care policy would not offer quality.

      "subtitle": "Left-wing pundits have accused President Donald Trump of using his tweets last weekend to launch a divisive re-election campaign.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " David Axelrod, former adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted: \u201cWith his deliberate, racist outburst, @realDonaldTrump wants to raise the profile of his targets, drive Dems to defend them and make them emblematic of the entire party. It\u2019s a cold, hard strategy.\u201d That is debatable \u2014 but if so, Axelrod should know; Obama did it first. By 2011, Obama knew that re-election would be difficult. The Tea Party had just led the Republicans to a historic victory in the 2010 midterm elections, winning the House and nearly taking the Senate. The economy was only growing sluggishly, and Obama\u2019s stimulus had failed to keep unemployment below eight percent, as projected. Moreover, the passage of Obamacare had provoked a backlash against Obama\u2019s state-centered model of American society. Facing a similar situation in the mid-1990s, President Bill Clinton had \u201ctriangulated,\u201d moving back toward the middle, frustrating the GOP by taking up their issues, such as welfare reform. But Obama rejected that approach. Having watched his icon, Chicago mayor Harold Washington, settle for an incremental approach when faced with opposition in the 1980s, only to die of a sudden heart attack before fulfilling his potential, Obama chose the path of hard-left policy \u2014 and divide-and-rule politics. The first hint of his strategy emerged during the debt ceiling negotiations in the summer of August 2011. As Bob Woodward recounted in his book about the crisis,\u00a0The Price of Politics, then-Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) had wanted to reach a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with the president on long-term spending cuts. But Obama blew up that agreement by demanding $400 billion in new taxes, to his aides\u2019 surprise. Obama wanted an opponent, not a deal. (Last week, Boehner told\u00a0Breitbart News Tonight that Obama\u2019s decision was his worst disappointment in 35 years of politics.) In the fall of 2011, a new left-wing movement, Occupy Wall Street, was launched. A mix of communists, anarchists, and digital pranksters, the Occupy movement\u00a0cast American society as a struggle between the \u201c99 percent\u201d and the \u201cone percent.\u201d Obama and then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) embraced the movement \u2014 and failed to distance themselves from it even as it collapsed into violence, sexual assault, and confrontations with police. Instead, Obama picked up on Occupy\u2019s themes and used them to shape his campaign. In December 2011, Obama gave a speech at Osawatomie, Kansas \u2014 a place steeped in radical symbolism \u2014 at which he doubled down on his left-wing policies. He focused on the issue of economic inequality, and attacked the idea that the free market could lift the middle class to prosperity. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about class warfare. This is about the nation\u2019s welfare,\u201d he insisted. Then, in the spring of 2012, Obama made a controversial play on race. When a black teen, Trayvon Martin, was killed in Florida during a scuffle with neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, Al Sharprton \u2014 who was serving as an informal adviser to Obama at the time \u2014 made the local crime story into a national racial controversy. Obama, following Sharpton\u2019s lead, weighed in:\u00a0\u201cIf I had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon,\u201d Obama said at the time. Poll numbers suggest that race relations, which had been improving, dropped precipitously after that. But to Obama, it was worth it: the campaign needed to find a way to motivate minority voters. (Vice President Joe Biden did his part, telling black voters that GOP nominee Mitt Romney was \u201cgonna put y\u2019all in chains.\u201d) Trump is pushing a non-racial, nationalist message. But if he actually wanted to divide America for political gain, he could learn from the master. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The former vice president, who has worried even the staunchest of allies\u00a0with his frequent lapses on the campaign trail, made the slip-up when arguing there were \u201cnatural limits\u201d on constitutional rights like the Second Amendment. \u201cI\u2019m the only guy that\u2019s beaten the NRA, and my state is a big gun-owning state because of hunting,\u201d Biden told voters in Laconia, New Hampshire, before touting decades-long support for gun control. In particular, Biden highlighted his work authoring the initial assault weapons ban, which was part of his controversial 1994 crime bill. \u201cI\u2019m the only guy that\u2019s beaten them twice. I got assault weapons banned for ten years, it had to be reauthorized because of hanging chads in Florida,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last president said no, I\u2019m not going to reauthorize it.\u201d The statement struck many as confusing, since the most recent former occupant of the White House, Obama, was an avid supporter of gun control, especially prohibitions on firearms utilizing high-capacity magazines. Biden was likely referencing President George W. Bush, who in 2004 signaled he would not make renewing the 10-year-old ban a priority in an election year. Despite having publicly supported the ban in the past, Bush\u2019s lack of enthusiasm doomed efforts at reauthorization in the then-Republican controlled Congress.  This is the second time in less than a month that Biden has appeared to forget Obama, a man he has often fondly called his \u201cbrother,\u201d while campaigning. In August, Biden could not remember Obama\u2019s name when invoking his administration\u2019s legacy in dealing with Russia. \u201cThey invaded a significant portion of another country and annexed a significant portion of it called Crimea,\u201d Biden said when discussing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine with voters in South Carolina. \u201cHe\u2019s saying it was President \u2014 my boss \u2014 it was his fault.\u201d The 76-year-old former vice president has also shown an inability to recollect\u00a0dates and places to the chagrin of some of his most prominent backers. Earlier this summer, Biden shocked the media establishment when he\u00a0claimed\u00a0to be vice president at the time of the\u00a0mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \u201cThose kids in Parkland came up to see me when I was vice president,\u201d Biden said during a huddle with reporters in Iowa, before claiming that when the survivors visited Congress, lawmakers were \u201cbasically cowering, not wanting to see them. They did not want to face it on camera.\u201d The statement was quickly disproved as the shooting,\u00a0which resulted in 17 fatalities and over a dozen injuries, actually occurred on February 14, 2018 \u2014 more than a year after Biden left office. In response, Biden\u2019s team claimed the candidate had simply misspoken and pivoted to attacking the media for pushing it\u2019s own \u201cnarrative\u201d around the gaffes. \u201cThis is a press narrative, not a voter narrative,\u201d Biden\u2019s spokeswoman, Symone Sanders, asserted during an appearance on MSNBC. Sanders even went to the extent of lecturing the media on what it should and should not prioritize to \u201celevate the conversation\u201d surrounding the election. \u201cWe cannot allow this election to devolve in a tit for tat over name-calling and \u2018gaffes,\u2019 something that does not matter,\u201d she said. That argument, however, did not appear to sway many, including some of the left\u2019s most venerated journalists. Some, like Jamil Smith, a senior writer for\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0magazine, have even called on the former vice president\u2019s campaign to \u201cstep forward\u201d and explain \u201cwhat is going on with him.\u201d  In the last week alone, such suggestions have flourished as Biden\u2019s campaign struggles to dismiss controversy surrounding his fabrication of an emotional story about the war in Afghanistan. The controversy began when Biden told a story to more than 400 New Hampshire voters last month about how\u00a0he was asked\u00a0to travel to Afghanistan to honor a Navy captain during his tenure as vice president. As Biden recollected, he was asked by a four star general to travel to Kunar province in Afghanistan \u2014 \u201ca dangerous foray into \u2018godforsaken country\u2019\u201d \u2014 to honor an officer that \u201crappelled down a 60-foot ravine under fire and retrieved the body\u201d of a fallen comrade. When some suggested it might be too dangerous to send a sitting vice president into a war zone, Biden brushed away concerns for his own safety. \u201cWe can lose a vice president,\u201d he claimed to have said in response to such worries. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose many more of these kids. Not a joke.\u201d Apart from Biden supposedly putting his own life in jeopardy, the story was made more complicated as the officer in question did not want the honor being bestowed by his superiors. According to Biden, the captain was refusing the medal, a Silver Star, because he felt like a \u201cfailure\u201d because the comrade he was attempting to save died during the mission. \u201cHe said, \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t want the damn thing!\u2019\u201d Biden, his jaw clenched and nearly shouting, relayed to the audience in New Hampshire. \u201c\u2019Do not pin it on me, Sir! Please, Sir. Do not do that! He died. He died!\u2019\u201d Biden\u2019s emotional telling of the story left those in the audience \u201csilent\u201d and visibly moved. Unfortunately for the former vice president, though,\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0found \u201calmost every detail of the story\u201d to be \u201cincorrect\u201d upon closer investigation. Biden visited Kunar province in 2008 as a U.S. senator, not as vice president. The service member who performed the celebrated rescue that Biden described was a 20-year-old Army specialist, not a much older Navy captain. And that soldier, Kyle J. White, never had a Silver Star, or any other medal, pinned on him by Biden. At a White House ceremony six years after Biden\u2019s visit, White stood at attention as President Barack Obama placed a Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest award for valor, around his neck. In fact, the paper concluded that Biden had conflated three separate stories, including one in which he actually \u201cdid pin a medal on a heartbroken soldier, Army Staff Sgt. Chad Workman, who didn\u2019t believe he deserved the award.\u201d \u201cIn the space of three minutes, Biden got the time period, the location, the heroic act, the type of medal, the military branch and the rank of the recipient wrong, as well as his own role in the ceremony,\u201d the\u00a0Post\u00a0reported. Upon the story breaking, Biden\u2019s team immediately sought to downplay and dismiss the controversy. Biden, himself, asserted the central points of his story were accurate, even if the details were not. He even went to\u00a0 claim details are not an important part within the confines of the presidency. \u201cThe details are irrelevant in terms of decision-making,\u201d Biden explained to NPR this past week when asked if his fuzziness with specifics was problematic for anyone aspiring to be commander in chief. All of this has left Biden\u2019s surrogates and allies wondering if the former vice president would be benefited by fewer public appearances and less speaking time on the stump. \u201cI think Vice President Biden needs to speak less, and listen more, and let people talk,\u201d Iowa State Senator Tony Bisignano, one of the former vice president\u2019s top backers, told Politico on Friday.",

      "content": " History is already revealing him to be one of the worst presidents in history, certainly in my lifetime (and I lived through the Carter years), but that he was a brilliant politician is not in doubt. I\u2019ll never forget the moment I knew Obama would be president. It was right after his Republican rival, Sen. John McCain, lost his ever-loving mind and quit the presidential campaign to go and save the economy. Immediately after McCain jumped on his white horse with nowhere to go, Obama called a press conference. But Obama was cool, you see. In his remarks, he said nothing about McCain. Then he opened things up for questions knowing McCain\u2019s madness would be the first question, and it was, and this is when Obama dropped the nuke: \u201cI think it is going to be part of the president\u2019s job to be able to deal with more than one thing at once.\u2019\u2019 That\u2019s how you win presidential elections. Obama did the same thing to Romney; time and again and again, Obama and his campaign emasculated the former Massachusetts governor. Romney almost constantly allowed himself to be on defense, to look weak and in a crouch. And whenever Romney tried to launch an offensive, he sounded shrill and desperate. Obama was a godawful president, but he played the role of president brilliantly. No question. Now watch the fake Hispanic Beto O\u2019Rourke launch his presidential campaign. The guy\u2019s a spaz, and how awkward is it watching his heiress wife count Beto\u2019s ear hairs:  More spaz-o-rama:  Forget about the drivel coming out of his mouth and watch him: watch Beto\u2019s body language, listen to the world salad\u2026 Obama always came off as calm, collected, No Drama Obama. O\u2019Rourke behaves like a male cheerleader at a college game. He\u2019s the ultimate beta male. And just so no one can accuse me of political bias, Marco Rubio had much of the same problem in 2016. Believe it or not, becoming president has nothing to do with policy, experience, or character or any of that stuff\u2026 Those things are addressed in the primaries. Sure, there are partisans on both sides who will vote for their guy no matter what, but it is still the 15 to 25 percent of the unaffiliated who choose our president \u2014 and going back to John F. Kennedy, to 1960 when television took over the messaging of political campaigns, it is the alpha male who has always won the presidency. By the way, this doesn\u2019t mean a woman can\u2019t become president. \u201cAlpha male\u201d is a figure of speech, shorthand for the poise, command, unflappable, and in charge. Hillary probably would have stomped all over Rubio or John Kasich. Her problem was that Donald Trump beat her soundly in that facet of the campaign. Don\u2019t confuse this observation with a 2020 prediction, an election that will almost certainly be decided in the same way all presidential re-election campaigns are decided \u2014 on the state of the economy. If we hit a recession next year, Boy George could probably beat Trump. What\u2019s more, O\u2019Rourke could toughen up during the primary, work on his presentation\u2026 My only point is that this worshipful comparing O\u2019Rourke to Obama is a more than a tad delusional right now. Yes, they share some of the same qualities, but the key one, the one that wins all the marbles is, to say the least, lacking. Obama was many things, but he was no spaz. Beto is a total spaz.

Obama commented on his understanding of the founding of the United States during the\u00a0VTEXDAY 2019 conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Wednesday. Obama said that the Constitution gave America the means of inclusion through Democracy. \u201cThe more people we included, the more successful we became,\u201d he said. Obama used a basketball analogy to illustrate his point, pointing out that the NBA was better than ever by including more international players like Giannis Antetokounmpo, a Nigerian from Greece who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks. \u201cNow he\u2019s one of the best players in the world,\u201d Obama said, pointing out that if the NBA did not include international players, they were leaving talent on the field. \u201cIf you don\u2019t include women, you are leaving talent on the field,\u201d Obama said, saying it was in every country\u2019s interest to \u201cinclude everyone.\u201d He admitted that \u201cperfect equality\u201d was difficult to achieve, because of natural talent and work ethic. \u201cThe issue is not perfect equality, the issue is, are those of us who are successful willing to give back enough to provide a ladder of opportunity for others that are coming behind us,\u201d he said. Obama continued with a discussion about the wealthy, asserting after a family obtained enough money to eat, buy a house, send their kids to college, and take a vacation once in a while, additional financial wealth would not make people happy. He acknowledged that he now had more money than he ever had in his life, and claimed he could not spend it all if he tried. \u201cIt\u2019s not money that is making me happy, but we teach ourselves that our measure of success is the more we have, the harder we hang onto it, the better we must be, the higher our status is,\u201d he said. Obama said that the concept of wealth and status in the United States was what made societies less equal. \u201cWe have to redesign our minds to say that we\u2019re at our most powerful and influential when we\u2019re able to help others,\u201d he concluded. Obama clarified that he still supported the concept of capitalism but called for a \u201crevolution of values\u201d to create a better, more equal society that was more environmentally stable. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to do us much good to have really wonderful apps and great virtual reality when the actual reality of the planet is getting hotter, and the oceans are rising, and the forests are getting cut down, and we can\u2019t breathe,\u201d he said.",

Obama\u2019s former secretary for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Julian Castro criticized Obama\u2019s former Department of Homeland Secretary, saying that his concern about decriminalizing crossing the border illegally was merely a \u201cright-wing talking point.\u201d He also criticized the Obama administration for high rates of deportation of illegal immigrants, challenging Joe Biden for failing to intervene. De Blasio also pressed Biden on why he did not advise Obama to slow deportation during the administration. \u201cDid you say those deportations were a good idea or did you go to the president and say, \u2018this is a mistake, we shouldn\u2019t do it,'\u201d he said. \u201cWhich one?\u201d Biden defended Obama for trying to pass comprehensive immigration reform but vowed that he would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d resume similar deportation rates as the Obama administration. Castro also joined the criticism of the Obama administration, suggesting that the former president had made mistakes in office. \u201cFirst of all, Mr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn\u2019t,\u201d he said to Biden. Biden reminded Castro that he also served in the Obama administration. \u201cI never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary,\u201d he said pointedly. But even Biden found himself implicitly criticizing Obama\u2019s proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal, which Trump killed, when asked if he would rejoin the proposed trade agreement with Asian nations. \u201cI would not rejoin the TPP as it was initially put forward,\u201d he said. Biden also criticized the surge of troops in Afghanistan, which took place in 2009 under President Obama. \u201cI opposed the surge in Afghanistan,\u201d he said, adding that he felt going into Afghanistan was a mistake. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard also criticized both parties for allowing the war in Afghanistan to continue. \u201cFor too long, we\u2019ve had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence, the toll that it takes on our service members, on their families,\u201d she said. Ultimately, Biden reminded his political rivals that Obama was the one that chose him as the vice president. \u201cEverybody is talking about how terrible I am on these issues. Barack Obama knew exactly who I was,\u201d he said, noting that he was fully vetted as vice president. \u201cHe chose me, and he said it was the best decision he made. I\u2019ll take his judgment.\u201d After the debate, Obama\u2019s former Attorney General Eric Holder cautioned Democrats for their attacks against the Obama administration. \u201cTo my fellow Democrats. Be wary of attacking the Obama record,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cBuild on it. Expand it.

Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and former special assistant to President Ronald Reagan, told Campus Reform that Obama\u2019s popularity with college students is due, at least in part, to their familiarity with the 44th president. \u201cPeople are best able to judge politicians with whom they are familiar,\u201d Bandow said in a brief comment. \u201cObama was an attractive personality and path-breaking president. He would look like the obvious choice for a lot of folks of university age if they weren\u2019t policy geeks focused on issues where they disagreed with his approach.\u201d Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus trends.",

      "content": " A new book claims that Obama endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton instead of Biden in 2016 because he was \u201cjust another white guy.\u201d \u201cJoe, despite his many virtues, was just another white guy, one in a long line of American presidents \u2014 hardly the symbol of the Teutonic change that Obama hoped would mark his place in the history books,\u201d wrote author Steven Levingston in a new book, according to the Daily Mail. Levingston is the nonfiction editor of the Washington Post,\u00a0and has authored books about former President John F. Kennedy. His new book,\u00a0Barack and Joe: The Making of an Extraordinary Partnership\u00a0is scheduled for release on October 8. \u201cBarack had placed his bet on Hillary, the one he believed would confirm his revolutionary stamp on American\u2019s political culture \u2013 the first black president passing the baton to the first woman president,\u201d he wrote. The book notes that Obama did not endorse Biden for president in 2020 either, marking a blow to his former vice president who routinely cites Obama\u2019s legacy on the campaign trail. Biden was also stung by the fact that Obama was meeting with potential presidential candidates such as former Rep. Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke, according to Livingston. The New York Times also reported in August that Obama told Biden, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Joe,\u201d referring to a conversation he had with his former vice president, and asked Biden\u2019s aids to not let the former vice president embarrass himself. The book also details an anecdote about Obama as a newly elected senator\u00a0emailing one of his advisers, \u201cShoot. Me. Now.\u201d as Biden droned on during a speech.",

The most famous African-American politician did not mention Trudeau\u2019s blackface scandal that threatened to crater his chances at re-election. \u201cI was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President,\u201d Obama continued. \u201cHe\u2019s a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change.\u201d Obama\u2019s endorsement was also surprising because of his decision to engage in international politics, choosing to meddle in a foreign election. More pointedly, Obama has not endorsed his former vice president, Joe Biden, in his presidential race. Trudeau and Obama got along well during their brief time together, before the former president left office. \u201cThe first call I made to him, I said, \u2018Justin, congratulations. You and your family look great. I know Canadians are incredibly inspired by your message of hope and change,\u2019\u201d Obama said when they met in 2015. ",
