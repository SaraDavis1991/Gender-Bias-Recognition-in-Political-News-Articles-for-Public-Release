      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " The Daily Mail reports that this latest money grab from the Clintons managed to attract only 3,300 in a stadium that holds 19,800 \u2014 which works out to 83 percent empty. This figure is made even more embarrassing by the fact that as the date of the event neared, the venue was not able to give tickets away at just $6.55 each. Ticket prices started between $200 and $53 Canadian. On top of that, in the middle of the event, Hillary had one of her famous coughing fits, which was caught on video.  While the aging Clintons spent much of the night bashing President Trump, they did so in front of a nearly empty room that proves just how out of touch they have both become. The belief they could fill a hockey arena is the worst kind of vanity. Had the event taken place at a smaller venue, the Clintons\u2019 diminishing appeal would not have been quite so obvious. Meanwhile, Hillary\u2019s nemesis, one Donald Trump, continues to draw crowds who wait in line all day and then fill arenas up to the rafters. The Clinton tour is promoted by Live Nation and promoted as a one-of-a-kind conversation with a former president and secretary of state. But with questions\u00a0such as,\u00a0\u201cWhy does Putin hate you so much? You seem like a very nice person,\u201d do people really want to leave their homes and spend good money to watch what appears to be just another cable news segment? As the American Thinker points out, \u201cWhile 3300 tickets sold at prices ranging from $53 to over $200 still yields a healthy payday, even after expenses, the optics are terrible,\u201d which is something even the far-left CNN is pointing out. \u201cI just think the optics of going to an event where people are paying to see them, and they are financially gaining from this, I am not sure that is the right way to reingratiate them back into the public sphere,\u201d said a former Clinton aide. \u201cThey haven\u2019t gone away, and I don\u2019t want them to go away, but I am not sure this is the right venue from an optics standpoint.\u201d The Toronto Star\u2019s review of the night earned the headline, \u201cHillary and Bill Just Won\u2019t Go Away.\u201d If this were a free tour, or a tour where all the profits went to charity, the optics would be much better. As it is, especially when you remember the Clintons are already worth hundreds of millions of dollars, it looks like just another cynical cash grab for two people who already have more money than they could ever hope to spend.

      "content": " One key to stopping this long international nightmare of Islamic terrorism will be reminding American voters every single day between now and November that the foreign policy decisions of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton caused the rise of ISIS. The history is very clear. When Barack Obama took office in 2008 with Hillary Clinton as his Secretary of State, one of his first moves on foreign policy was his New Beginning speech in Cairo, Egypt. With members of the Muslim Brotherhood in attendance, Pres. Obama claimed a new era had begun in America\u2019s attitude toward Islam. What followed was the \u201cArab Spring\u201d uprisings throughout the region. Even though people initially hailed these as bold moves by people desperate for freedom, the \u201cArab Spring\u201d was, in fact, a way for Islamists to dethrone the region\u2019s more secular military dictators. Cairo itself made this clear: just months after Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton declared a new beginning, rebels removed Hosni Mubarak from office, and the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood came to power and installed brutal sharia law. The single biggest factor that led to the rise of ISIS was the failed attempt to overthrow Syrian Pres. Bashar al-Assad. The United States openly called for the overthrow of Assad, even though it was clear that the result of that overthrow would be Islamist groups taking over. Syria proved to be resistant to the Obama/Clinton calls for regime change. Instead of the quick overthrow that happened in Egypt, Assad, aided by the Russians and opposed by the U.S., held on \u2013 even as the United States was giving weapons to the so-called \u201crebels\u201d that would eventually find their way into the hands of Islamist groups. This power vacuum in Syria created the conditions for ISIS to rise. In Iraq, the continued withdrawals that happened under Hillary Clinton\u2019s watch created another power vacuum that led to ISIS gaining more land and resources. This interview, which I did with Clare Lopez from the Center for Security Policy,\u00a0gives even more detail \u2014\u00a0in just five minutes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eziEBvzbOU The mainstream media has done nothing to explain this to the American people. However, simply complaining about the mainstream media is not enough. The stakes are too high to let mere grumbling suffice. No, what needs to happen is that the Donald Trump campaign and the Republican Party need to realize that the ball is in their court when it comes to bringing Americans the truth. Trump, his surrogates, his supporters, and every single Republican politician needs to take this responsibility seriously and lay out a factual case for the American people, as often as possible. The real danger here is that Republicans are so used to losing the public relations battle that they give it up before it even starts. After years of being battered by the institutional left media complex, Republicans are too used to cowering and surrendering. There needs to be an immediate commitment to clear-eyed truth-telling by the GOP\u2026 otherwise, America is in for four years of Clinton once again setting foreign policy.",

      "author": "Charlie Spiering",
      "content": " The former Secretary of State spoke at an event at Georgetown University and said she had spoken to \u201cmany\u201d of the 2020 Democrat presidential candidates and left each of them with an ominous warning. \u201cYou can run the best campaign, you can have the best plans, you can get the nomination, you can win the popular vote, and you can lose the electoral college and therefore the election,\u201d she warned. Clinton said she told every candidate that they would get their emails hacked, referring to her campaign manager John Podesta who fell for a phishing attempt to get access to his private Gmail address. \u201cIf you have not had your personal and campaign emails hacked, they will be,\u201d she warned, adding that the information would be \u201cstolen and weaponized against you in the most pernicious ways.\u201d \u201cRemember Pizzagate? WikiLeaks?\u201d she added wryly, referring to the \u201chorrible kinds of outcomes we saw before when people believed pizzagate.\u201d She demanded the press and the public immediately discredit weaponized hacked information in future elections. Clinton also warned of \u201cphony false online news stories\u201d that migrated to the \u201cso-called mainstream media.\u201d She pointed to the \u201cso-called deep-fake\u201d videos online such as the one of Nancy Pelosi appearing drunk in a video that Facebook declined to take down, as they believed social media users could decide for themselves whether it was true or not. \u201cHow can you decide for yourself when what is presented is blatantly false and manufactured?\u201d she asked with exasperation. Trump and some online media outlets, she insisted, were creating a crisis in the United States. \u201cRacist and white supremacist views are lifted up in the media and in the White House,\u201d she said. She warned of \u201cdisturbing\u201d efforts by the president\u2019s campaign to distribute \u201cpropaganda\u201d on social media. \u201cThe Trump campaign is already spending hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars on Facebook each week to spread fake endorsements and outright lies about the Democrats,\u201d she said. Clinton cited \u201cvoter suppression\u201d in the 2018 midterm elections where Stacy Abrams \u201cshould be the governor\u201d of Georgia and Andrew Gillum lost his race for Florida Governor because the election \u201cneither free nor fair, and certainly not transparent.\u201d She cited a study from 2016, noting that anywhere between 27,000 to 200,000 Wisconsin voters were turned away from the polls on election day for having incorrect voting information, suggesting that\u2019s why she lost in 2016. Clinton also claimed that the suppression of the black vote was also part of the reason she lost. \u201cI was the first person who ran for president in more than 50 years without the protection of the Voting Rights act and let me tell you, it makes a difference.\u201d She also brought up a case where Russians had accessed two online voting systems in Florida, as evidence that foreign powers could directly change voting tallies in the state. \u201cThink about that. A direct assault by a foreign advisory on a state\u2019s election system and citizens of that state and our country can\u2019t know about it?\u201d she asked. Clinton said the reports she mentioned were only the \u201cbare minimum\u201d of what really happened in the election, citing the Mueller report as evidence of widespread Russian interference in the election. She theorized that her support for \u201cfree and fair elections\u201d when she was Secretary of State was part of the reason that Vladimir Putin hated her so much. Clinton also alluded that authorities leaders like Putin, Mussolini, and Hitler \u201cchanged the rules\u201d of elections to keep themselves in power, hinting that Republicans were doing the same things. \u201cThey believed in elections all right, they believed \u2018one and you\u2019re done,\u2019 get in, change the rules to perpetuate your own power to grow your own authoritarian rule,\u201d she said.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Freeman, the assistant editor of the WSJ\u2019s editorial page, noted\u00a0that Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley (IA) and Ron Johnson (WI) wrote\u00a0Monday morning to Attorney General William Barr, asking if he has come up with any answers to the question of whether the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign used the government of Ukraine \u201cfor the express purpose of finding negative information on then-candidate Trump in order to undermine his campaign.\u201d Grassley originally wrote in July 2017 regarding whether the DNC and the Clinton campaign had used the Ukraine government in order to sabotage the Trump campaign. The senators continued: That letter also highlighted news reports that, during the 2016 presidential election, \u201cUkrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump\u201d and did so by \u201cdisseminat[ing] documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggest[ing] they were investigating the matter[.]\u201d Ukrainian officials also reportedly \u201chelped Clinton\u2019s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers.\u201d The plan involved\u00a0Alexandra Chalupa, reportedly a \u201cUkrainian-American operative\u201d consulting for the DNC. Chalupa \u201creportedly met with Ukrainian officials during the presidential election for the express purpose of exposing alleged ties between then-candidate Donald Trump, Paul Manafort, and Russia,\u201d Grassley and Johnson wrote to Barr. \u201cThe quotations come from a 2017 story in Politico, hardly a pro-Trump outfit,\u201d Freeman, co-author of Borrowed Time, observed, noting the headline, \u201cUkrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire.\u201d \u201cKiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president-elect after quietly working to boost Clinton,\u201d was the subheading, he pointed out. Politico\u00a0authors Kenneth Vogel and David Stern wrote in that article: Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton\u2019s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico\u00a0investigation found. The goal of Ukraine\u2019s reported aid to Clinton was to advance \u201cthe narrative that Trump\u2019s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine\u2019s foe to the east, Russia.\u201d Freeman noted: With the benefit of hindsight and the results of the Mueller investigation, it\u2019s now clear that there was no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia. What is not clear and what demands further investigation is how this baseless claim managed to consume the first two years of an American presidency. Though the idea of such an effort by Ukraine appeared unlikely to some, Vogel and Stern insisted: Politico\u2019s investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another\u2019s elections. Freeman concluded the Politico\u00a0investigation \u201cmay be helpful in figuring out exactly how the surveillance tools of America\u2019s national security apparatus were turned against the party out of power in 2016.\u201d",

So, don\u2019t tell me about words,\u201d Trump said. Fact-Check: TRUE In the mid-1980s, journalist Roy Reed interviewed Hillary Clinton, and\u00a0a tape of that interview has been uploaded to YouTube and is available in the Special Collections Department of the University of Arkansas libraries. \u201cHe took a lie detector test!

Kathy Shelton was just 12 years old when a 41-year-old drifter raped her on the side of a desolate Arkansas road in 1975. Now, four decades later, she has agreed to be named and pictured for the first time in this Daily Mail Online exclusive because she is furious that her rapist\u2019s defense attorney \u2013 Hillary Clinton \u2013 has been portraying herself as a lifelong advocate of women and girls on the campaign trail. \u2018It\u2019s put a lot of anger back in me,\u2019 said Shelton, now 54, in an exclusive interview at her Springdale, Arkansas, home in August. \u2018Every time I see [Clinton] on TV I just want to reach in there and grab her, but I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 In 1975, Clinton served as the defense lawyer for Thomas Alfred Taylor, a 41-year-old factory worker accused of raping Shelton after luring her to his car. Taylor pleaded down to \u2018unlawful fondling of a minor\u2019 and served less than a year in prison after Clinton was able to block the admission of forensic evidence that linked her client to the crime. Shelton also tweeted about her suffering at Hillary\u2019s hands.      ",

Clinton stated at the event:\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s also critical to understand that, as I\u2019ve been telling candidates who have come to see me, you can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you.\u201d One huge scandal that appeared to negatively affect Clinton during the 2016 presidential race was cybersecurity-related; the investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email servers by the former FBI Director James Comey. Clinton denied any wrongdoing in the matter but it was discovered that while acting as Secretary of State, Clinton sent classified material from an unsecured server located in her basement. After the server was wiped of all data, Clinton and her team faced suspicions of concealing evidence. Clinton attempted to defend herself from accusations by claiming incompetence in tech matters; when asked if her team had wiped the server she replied:\u00a0\u201cWhat, like with a cloth or something?\u201d She added:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know how it works digitally at all.\u201d Clinton will be the keynote speaker at the Cyber Defense Summit 2019 which takes place starting October 9.

So, maybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again. But, just seriously, I don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.

      "content": " Clinton, the defeated 2016 Democratic Party nominee for president, appeared on MSNBC\u2019s\u00a0Rachel Maddow Show\u00a0on May 1, 2019.\u00a0She repeated Trump\u2019s joke from July 2016 \u2014 which was taken seriously enough by President Barack Obama and the intelligence community to provide a pretext for eavesdropping on the Trump campaign \u2014 in which he said, \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 [Clinton] e-mails that are missing.\u201d As Breitbart News reported in May, the former secretary of state told Maddow that since Senate Republicans declined to pass Democrat-sponsored bills to secure American elections against foreign interference, the left should openly enlist the aid of Chinese espionage (transcript via MSNBC): Hillary Clinton:\u00a0The Republicans in the Senate wouldn\u2019t at all go forward with some of the\u00a0bipartisan legislation that was meant to secure our elections under orders\u00a0from the White House. \u2026 Imagine, Rachel, that you had one of the Democratic nominees for 2020 on\u00a0your show, and that person said, you know, the only other adversary of ours\u00a0who is anywhere near as good as the Russians is China. So, why should\u00a0Russia have all the fun?\u00a0 And since Russia is clearly backing Republicans,\u00a0why don\u2019t we ask China to back us. Rachel Maddow:\u00a0I hereby tonight ask China \u2013 Hillary Clinton:\u00a0 That`s right. And not only that, China, if you\u2019re listening, why\u00a0don\u2019t you get Trump\u2019s tax returns.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure our media would richly reward\u00a0you. Now according to the Mueller report, that is not conspiracy because it\u2019s\u00a0done right out in the open. So, if after this hypothetical Democratic candidate says this on your show,\u00a0within hours, all of a sudden, the IRS offices are bombarded with\u00a0incredibly sophisticated cyber tools looking for Trump\u2019s tax returns, and\u00a0then extracts and them and then passes them to whatever the new WikiLeaks\u00a0happens to be and they start being unraveled and disclosed \u2013 nothing wrong\u00a0with that. I mean, if you`re going let Russia get away with what they did and are\u00a0still doing according to Christopher Wray, the current FBI director, who\u00a0said that last week, they\u2019re in our election systems.\u00a0 We\u2019re worried about\u00a02020, he said. So, hey, let`s have a great power contest, and let\u2019s get the Chinese in on\u00a0the side of somebody else.\u00a0 Just saying that shows how absurd the situation\u00a0we find ourselves in. No one called for Clinton to be investigated, much less prosecuted. This week, however, Democrats and journalists alike declared that Trump deserved to be impeached for calling, openly, for China and Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption tied to former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate for the Democratic Party nomination. Democrats have been searching for Trump\u2019s old tax returns for years, convinced that they contain incriminating or at least politically embarrassing information. In 2017, Maddow produced his 2005 tax return \u2014 which showed he paid a significant amount in taxes. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

She has also blamed Sanders, who begrudgingly endorsed her, declaring at the time that she \u201cwill make an outstanding president.\u201d Though Sanders did not endorse Clinton as quickly or enthusiastically as she may have liked, he did not attack her during the primary as strongly as he could have. The socialist senator defended his opponent\u2019s illegal use of an unsecured \u201chomebrew\u201d email server to conduct official business as Secretary of State, and he largely declined to pick up on \u201cpay-to-play\u201d allegations surrounding the Clinton Foundation \u2014 particularly Clinton\u2019s involvement in the sale of 20% of America\u2019s uranium to Russia. Judging by the Vermont senator\u2019s recent remarks, there looks to be no love lost between him and Clinton. When Meghan McCain of\u00a0The View\u00a0asked this March whether the two had met to discuss the 2020 race,\u00a0Sanders bluntly replied, \u201cI suspect not.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not interested in any advice from her?\u201d McCain followed up. \u201cI think not,\u201d he responded.

      "content": " Breitbart News spoke to over a dozen Hillary Clinton fans outside the Truckee Meadows Community College. None knew exactly what the \u201calt-right\u201d is; a few had a vague idea that it referred to Republicans, or that Democrats were trying to\u00a0connect it with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Most simply had not heard of the \u201calt-right,\u201d and some misidentified it completely. (Breitbart covered it here.) They simply did not know\u00a0what the \u201calt-right\u201d was until later, when Hillary Clinton told them, and told them it was bad. (Some were willing to believe in advance that it was bad, merely because they knew she would tell them it was.) The video below shows the interviews in exact chronological order. Only one interview was omitted, at the interviewee\u2019s request, when she was embarrassed that she could not answer the question, and asked Breitbart News to delete the video of her response. The video is below:  A local press representative for the Hillary Clinton campaign declined to answer questions about the alt-right. The mood outside was festive, occasionally punctured by protests from about a dozen anti-Hillary Clinton protesters. In her remarks, Hillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump and Breitbart News in particular, attempting to associate both with a \u201cfringe\u201d that includes the \u201calt-right\u201d and figures like David Duke of the Ku Klux Klan. \u201cThe de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump Campaign represents a landmark achievement for the \u2018Alt-Right,'\u201d Clinton claimed, referring to the recent appointment of Breitbart chairman Stephen K. Bannon as CEO of the Trump campaign. (Bannon is on leave from Breitbart until after the election.) \u201cA fringe element has effectively taken over the Republican Party,\u201d she added. The accusation of \u201cextremism\u201d is a frequent refrain for Democrats. In 2011, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY)\u00a0was caught on a hot mic telling others that he would begin referring to the Tea Party as \u201cextreme\u201d because \u201cthat\u2019s what the caucus instructed me to do the other week.\u201d Trump responded:  Joel B.

HILLARY CLINTON:\u00a0You know, Judy, this is the goal of the Trump strategy: It is to raise questions. There is no evidence that either one of them did anything wrong. Could there be a question of judgment about his son? Well, that\u2019s fair game. But there is absolutely no evidence, and there will not be any evidence, that Joe Biden did anything wrong. Enough with these wild unfounded conspiracy theories. Using the help of foreign governments to interfere in our election and to undermine people who have been in the public eye for a long time and I hope the American people reject this, as they should. In recent days, President Donald Trump has suggested China and Ukraine investigate alleged corruption committed by the Biden family.\u00a0As Breitbart News extensively reported, Hunter Biden\u2019s investment company scored a\u00a0$1.5 billion investment deal\u00a0with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013. Further,\u00a0then-vice president\u00a0Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating the gas giant Burisma Holdings, which was paying Hunter Biden $83,000 monthly as a member of its board, despite his lack of expertise in the energy sector. Biden later\u00a0boasted\u00a0before the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. Clinton may have a personal dog in this fight, as the Biden allegations first came from a book by Peter Schweizer \u2014 investigative journalist, president of the Government Accountability Institute, and senior contributor to Breitbart News \u2014 called Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends. The book functions as a spiritual sequel to Schweizer\u2019s\u00a0Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich. That book\u2019s findings, confirmed even by Democrat-friendly corporate media, became a major problem for her campaign and may have helped in the decline of The Clinton Foundation.",

She did not mention Clinton. But on Friday, Gabbard let loose:    Gabbard, who supported Sen.

The left has long resented Clinton for voting to authorize the Iraq War. She also took credit for the war in Libya \u2014 a war that had disastrous results, as it allowed terrorist groups to take root across northern Africa. Clinton was widely blamed by conservatives for lax security around the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which was attacked on Sep. 11, 2012. The Obama administration originally characterized the attack as a protest against an anti-Islamic video posted by an obscure American filmmaker on YouTube.
