American schools are preparing for the student climate school strikes organized Friday for students to highlight climate change. New York City\u2019s Department of Education has already promised to excuse absences of students participating in the climate strike if they have parental consent. Thunberg traveled to the United States to lead the school strike, which will take place in 150 different countries ahead of the United Nations climate summit in New York City next week. Thunberg also took a year off of school to protest the global threat posed by climate change. \u201cIf you can\u2019t be in the strike, then, of course, you don\u2019t have to,\u201d she said in an interview with Teen Vogue. \u201cBut I think if there is one day you should join, this is the day.\u201d Since losing the presidential election to President Donald Trump, Clinton has championed the cause of women activists. She is currently touring the United States to promote her new book, The Book of Gutsy Women, co-authored with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton.",

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " \u201cThe president asked a foreign power to help him win an election. Again,\u201d Clinton wrote on Twitter.  In her tweet, Clinton seemingly referenced a joke then-candidate Trump told in 2016 in which he asked Russia to locate his Democrat rival\u2019s emails on a private server.\u00a0\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,\u201d he said at the time. The former secretary of state\u2019s comment came in response to an interview in which Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, told CNN that he requested the Ukrainian government to probe\u00a0possible wrongdoing which may have involved former vice president and\u00a02020 frontrunner Joe Biden. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask them to look into Joe Biden,\u201d\u00a0Giuliani told host Christopher Cuomo on Thursday. \u201cI asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client, which, tangentially, involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme, not unlike what he did in China.\u201d In 2016, Biden, according to the New York Times, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless\u00a0Ukrainian prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko was removed.\u00a0Lutsenko was probing possible wrongdoing of an energy firm of which Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was a board member. Last month, Giuliani revealed he spoke to a Ukrainian official about Biden\u2019s potential role in the prosecutor\u2019s removal. \u201cThe only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko \u2026 dismissed the case against [Ukrainian\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Centre],\u201d he said.",

      "author": "Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.",
      "content": " \u201cI just don\u2019t understand in this world of political correctness and so many attacking others because of blackface in the past,\u201d tweeted Bishop Rick Stika Friday. \u201cThe folks like the Democratic Party support Planned Parenthood. It was founded by a racists [sic] who who wanted to eliminate people of color and the poor.\u201d Bishop Stika, who has been unafraid to weigh on various sides of a number of social issues, eluding easy pigeonholing, said that he was appalled that Hillary Clinton accepted the Margaret Sanger award, given Sanger\u2019s well-known racism. \u201cThis evil organization gives an award named for is racists [sic] founder that Hillary received and she said she was proud to receive it,\u201d the bishop said. In March 2018, a Planned Parenthood student group at the University of Florida hosted an event to discuss the racist roots of the organization as well as the eugenics of founder Margaret Sanger. \u201cCome join Planned Parenthood Generation Action for a panel discussion on the racist roots of Planned Parenthood during Black History Month,\u201d read the Facebook announcement of the event bearing the title \u201cDecolonizing Sexual Health.\u201d \u201cOur subject is addressing the racist roots of the birth control movement, specifically pertaining to the influence of eugenics,\u201d the post continued. \u201cMargaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood\u2019s founder, is a controversial figure in this conversation because despite her devotion to reproductive rights, she also had beliefs, practices, and associations with eugenics that we acknowledge and denounce, and work to rectify today.\u201d Organizers said that the event was meant \u201cto open a conversation about the decolonization of sexual health and how resources are disproportionally [sic] inaccessible to folks based on demographics.\u201d According to a number of Planned Parenthood critics, however, the problem is not the\u00a0inaccessibility\u00a0of abortion services to minority communities, but rather its opposite: the\u00a0targeting\u00a0of minority communities \u2014 which seems to fit with the original racist aims of the organization. The racist practices of Planned Parenthood continue to this day, since the abortion giant continues to target black and Hispanic babies for abortion by the placement of their abortion clinics overwhelmingly in minority neighborhoods. Just prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a group of prominent black Christian clergy and intellectuals wrote an \u201copen letter\u201d to Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, denouncing her complicity in America\u2019s abortion crisis, which they said has had a \u201ccatastrophic impact\u201d on the black community. \u201cBlack babies are dying at terrifying rates,\u201d stated the 26 black leaders, including eight bishops. \u201cDon\u2019t black lives matter?\u201d In their letter, the leaders noted that the rate of abortion among blacks is far higher than among whites, with \u201c365 black babies aborted for every 1,000 that are born.\u201d \u201cBlacks account for roughly 38% of all abortions in the country though we represent only 13% of the population,\u201d they said, citing statistics that have led black Christian leaders to speak of a \u201cblack genocide\u201d occurring at the hands of abortionists. Abortion \u201cis the deliberate destruction of a human life in its most vulnerable state,\u201d they said, contrary to both natural law and biblical principle, held by the \u201cvast majority of black churches.\u201d Among white women in America, there are 138 abortions for every 1000 live births; among blacks, there are 501 abortions for every 1000 births. This means that blacks are aborted at 3.6 times the rate of whites in the United States. For these reasons, the Rev. Clenard Childress, pastor of the New Calvary Baptist Church in Montclair, N.J, has fought to have the NAACP reverse its 2004 decision to endorse abortion. Childress has stated that \u201cthe most dangerous place for an African American is in the womb.\u201d Calling abortion in America \u201cracist genocide,\u201d Childress said that since 1973, after the Supreme Court legalized abortion on demand, 13 million African-American babies have been put to death through abortion. While abortion is the leading cause of death for all Americans, it is even more so for the black community, and accounts for more deaths than any disease or homicide. ",

      "content": " \u201cI wish President Trump\u2019s enemies would give it a rest,\u201d said Rev. Graham in a tweet Monday in reaction to new accusations from an alleged \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d \u201cFor 2 years all the American people heard was collusion. Not true,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThen accusations seemed to come out of the woodwork by various women. Then all we heard was impeachment. Now it\u2019s a whistleblower claim.\u201d The relentless attacks on the president should really give way to allowing the democratic process to follow its course, said the prominent evangelist and pastor. \u201cPresident Trump was elected to do a job,\u201d Graham said in another tweet. \u201cLet\u2019s pray for him, that God will give him wisdom to make the right decisions for the American people and to do his job well.\u201d No one can accuse Franklin Graham of being an uncritical Trump cheerleader. It took him a while to become convinced that Trump was really the man for the job, despite his obvious failings. Graham never endorsed Trump during the 2016 campaign but said that when placed side-by-side with Hillary Clinton, the choice was obvious, since while Trump\u2019s comments might be \u201ccrude,\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s progressive agenda is \u201cgodless\u201d and cannot be defended. \u201cThere\u2019s two different pictures and two different visions for America,\u201d Graham said just prior to the elections. \u201cThe Democratic Party has a vision, Hillary Clinton has a vision, Donald Trump has a totally different vision for this nation with the Republican Party. This isn\u2019t difficult to figure out if you are a Christian.\u201d \u201cYou may have to hold your nose and vote,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI have people that say, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t like Donald Trump. I don\u2019t like what he says.\u2019 Well, I don\u2019t like what he said, either. I promise I don\u2019t like it. But those are things that he said 11 years ago, not something that he said today.\u201d \u201cI think Donald Trump has changed,\u201d Graham added. \u201cI think God is working on his heart and in his life. But people have to make up their own mind.\u201d Not long after the elections, Rev. Graham again voiced his belief that Mr. Trump was by far the better candidate for the White House, proposing that it was the \u201chand of God,\u201d rather than Russian hackers, that determined the outcome of the election. \u201cI think maybe God has allowed Donald Trump to win this election to protect this nation for the next few years by giving maybe an opportunity to have some good judges,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I know is Donald Trump was supposed to lose the election\u201d according to all the polls, Graham said. \u201cFor these states to go the way they did, in my opinion, I think it was the hand of God,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hacking. It wasn\u2019t Wiki-leaky or whatever. It was God, in my opinion, and I believe his hand was at work, and I think he\u2019s given Christians an opportunity.\u201d ",

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " Clinton told People magazine in an interview published Tuesday: I\u2019m in favor of moving toward impeachment. I did not come to that decision easily or quickly, but this is an emergency as I see it. \u2026 This latest behavior around Ukraine, trying to enlist the president of Ukraine in a plot to undermine former Vice President Biden or lose the military aide he needs to defend against Trump\u2019s friend, Vladimir Putin \u2014 if that\u2019s not an impeachable offense, I don\u2019t know what is. \u201cWe are in a crisis,\u201d she added. Clinton\u2019s comments come as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal impeachment inquiry at a press conference on Capitol Hill, telling reporters that the House of Representatives is \u201cmoving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\u201d Pelosi said: The actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution, especially when the president says, Article II says I can do whatever I want. And this week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically, the actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections. \u201cI\u2019m directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of an impeachment inquiry. The president must be held accountable,\u201d she added. The development followed a group of moderate Democrats who face tough re-election fights in 2020 coming out in favor of ousting President Trump. On Tuesday, House\u00a0Oversight Committee Chair Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and\u00a0Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) publically expressed support for the move. Despite numerous congressional Democrats\u2019 eagerness to impeachment President Trump over his call with\u00a0Zelensky, it\u2019s unclear if their conversation included illegalities.\u00a0Further, the alleged \u201cwhistleblower\u201d who reportedly claims to have knowledge of the president pressuring Zelensky did not hear the pair\u2019s conversation first hand. Additionally, Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko also dismissed the notion of any crime in President Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky. \u201cI know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,\u201d Prystaiko told\u00a0Hromadske, a Ukrainian online broadcast outlet. \u201cThere was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.\u201d ",

Schiff added that the testimony could come as \u201csoon as this week\u201d:  The announcement sparked questions about the lawyers representing the whistleblower.\u00a0Andrew P. Bakaj, a former CIA official and founding/partnering manager of the Washington DC-based Compass\u00a0Rose Legal Group, is one of the attorneys representing the whistleblower. He and the firm specialize in \u201cadverse security clearance actions, whistleblower activities, and individuals, corporations, and organizations who are facing criminal and/or administrative investigations.\u201d Yahoo News\u00a0notes that he\u00a0\u201cleft the CIA in 2014 after facing professional retaliation for trying to work with intelligence community whistleblowers,\u201d and the Washington Times describes him as a \u201cvindicated whistleblower.\u201d The firm\u2019s website details Bakaj\u2019s past work as a private practice attorney in the nation\u2019s capital and highlights his experience on Capitol Hill, working for three senators: late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY), as well as Schumer and Clinton. The bio also\u00a0mentions\u00a0Bakaj\u2019s past work\u00a0for the Department of State, particularly at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine. \u201cWhile traveling on official business in L\u2019viv, Ukraine, he was called upon to act as the American Official \u2018on scene\u2019 and assist in the U.S. Government\u2019s response to one of the world\u2019s deadliest air show disasters, which resulted in substantial American aid,\u201d his bio reads. Some, such as\u00a0Rep. Mark Walker (D-NC), viewed Bakaj\u2019s past work with Clinton and Schumer as a red flag. \u201cLet me get this straight: the whistleblower (leaker) had no firsthand knowledge of the call and was just spreading a rumor?\u201d he asked Tuesday. \u201cAnd now is being represented by an attorney who had to leave the CIA after a \u2018whistleblower\u2019 incident and has the names Schumer and Clinton on his resum\u00e9?\u201d\u00a0he continued. \u201cThis seems about as reputable as the DNC-funded dossier or the latest Kavanaugh propaganda,\u201d he added:  Bakaj is joined by fellow attorney Mark Zaid\u2013\u00a0a frequent Trump critic who announced his role in joining the legal team over the weekend. \u201cBREAKING NEWS: I am now formally part of legal team, through @CompassRosePLLC & lead counsel @AndrewBakaj, rep\u2019ing #natsec #whistleblower at center of current controversy,\u201d Zaid announced. \u201cNeither law firm @MarkSZaidPC nor @BradMossEs involved so Brad can continue to comment on WB policy/law,\u201d he added:  Moss\u2019s purported lack of involvement has not stopped him from issuing snarky remarks on Twitter. On Friday, he called critics of the whistleblower \u2013 conservative critics, specifically \u2013 \u201chuman excrement posing as human beings.\u201d \u201cThere is a special place in the fiery pits of Hell for \u2018law and order\u2019 conservatives who smear a whistleblower who made a protected disclosure through proper channels as outlined in federal law,\u201d he declared. \u201cThey are human excrement posing as human beings,\u201d he added: There is a special place in the fiery pits of Hell for \u201claw and order\u201d conservatives who smear a whistleblower who made a protected disclosure through proper channels as outlined in federal law. They are human excrement posing as human beings. \u2014 Bradley P. Moss (@BradMossEsq) September 20, 2019  Zaid has also been vocal on Twitter, openly expressing his contempt for the president:      Both Zaid and Bakaj are also associated with Whistleblower Aid, which Zaid co-founded alongside whistleblower John Tye following Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017. \u201cWhistleblower Aid is a non-profit, law firm in Washington, D.C. We support individuals who, lawfully, report government and corporate law breaking,\u201d the website states. \u201cIt\u2019s quite scary to be a whistleblower,\u201d Tye told the Washington Examiner in September 2017. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to attract people who see something wrong and want to do something about it and not go to prison.\u201d However, it seemed clear that the founders had the Russia investigation on their minds at the time. As the Washington Examiner reported: Whistleblower Aid describes itself as \u201ca pioneering, non-profit law firm that helps patriotic government employees and brave, private-sector workers report and publicize their concerns\u201d with legal advice that \u201cis confidential, but never ideological or partisan.\u201d Asked in 2017 about the timing of the group\u2019s launch, Tye said, \u201cWe want to advise people what to do, whether it\u2019s going to Congress, or an inspector general or Robert Mueller,\u201d referring to the special counsel handling the Russia investigation. As FEC filings indicate, Tye donated $2,700 to Hillary for America in 2016, adding to the web of blatant anti-Trumpers associated with those representing the whistleblower. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) \u2013 spurred by the whistleblower\u2019s claims \u2013 officially announced the launch of an impeachment inquiry against the president on Tuesday. \u201cThe House of Representatives will move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry. The President must be held accountable; no one is above the law,\u201d she said:  Trump authorized the \u201ccomplete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript\u201d of his conversation with Ukraine\u2019s President Zelensky prior to Pelosi\u2019s announcement and slammed Democrats for perpetuating a \u201ctotal Witch Hunt\u201d shortly thereafter:      ",

The transcript of the call did not provide the smoking gun hoped for by Democrats:   On the topic of Biden\u2019s son: Trump: \u2026 I just want to let you know that\u2019s the other thing, There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you \u00b7can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me. President Zelenskyy: I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I\u2019m knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament; the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved, by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of.that and will work on the investigation of the case.

Trump mocked Hillary for saying that the emails she deleted were personal. \u201cThen she said, as I remember it, that \u2018Oh they had to do with the wedding and yoga,\u2019 She does a lot of yoga right?\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo they had 33,000 emails about the wedding of her daughter and yoga, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Trump told Zelensky that the United States also had a lot of corruption, citing the actions of former FBI director James Comey and others in the FBI. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s going to be found out soon,\u201d he said. The transcript of Trump\u2019s phone conversation with Zelensky revealed that the president was interested in the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, suggesting that they could have information about the Democrat National Committee\u2019s email server which was claimed to have been hacked by Russia in 2016. \u201cThe server, they say Ukraine has it,\u201d Trump said during the call. \u201cThere are a lot of things that went on, the\u00b7whole situation.

The Duchess interviewed the former first lady for the September 2019 issue of British Vogue, which the Duchess guest edited. In it the two discussed motherhood, giving advice to children, and girls\u2019 education. The Duchess of Sussex called the former FLOTUS \u201cmagical\u201d and praised her \u201cendearingly frank, down-to-earth personality.\u201d More recently Hillary Clinton went public with her adoration of the Duchess, being\u00a0full of praise for how the newly-minted Royal is \u201crepresenting the U.S. in the UK and on the world stage.\u201d She took to Instagram earlier this month to share a snap of the Royal hugging a woman to illustrate her affection. Hillary captioned the picture: \u201cI\u2019m so inspired by how Meghan Markle\u2014aka one half of @sussexroyal\u2014is representing the U.S. in the U.K. and on the world stage. \u201cMeghan\u2019s new project: Helping @SmartWorksCharity equip women who have been out of the workforce with the office essentials they need to feel confident in job interviews and beyond.

The praise for the Duchess coming from two former first ladies is not the first nod towards her rising global profile and the adoration from international elites. As Breitbart News reported, earlier this month she was\u00a0crowned Britain\u2019s top social climber by society bible\u00a0Tatler\u00a0which observed Markle had reached \u201cthe pinnacle of the greasy pole\u201d in the space of barely 12 months. The 38-year-old achieved her honor in social mobility by the simple process\u00a0of marrying into the British Royal Family, Tatler observed.

      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " One of several themes is financing tied to Google, whose Google Capital led a $100 million funding drive that financed Crowdstrike. Google Capital, which now goes by the name of CapitalG, is an arm of Alphabet Inc., Google\u2019s parent company. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, has been a staunch and active supporter of Hillary Clinton and is a longtime donor to the Democratic Party. CrowdStrike was mentioned by Trump in his call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Perkins Coie, the law firm that represented the DNC and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, reportedly helped draft CrowdStrike to aid with the DNC\u2019s allegedly hacked server. On behalf of the DNC and Clinton\u2019s campaign, Perkins Coie also paid the controversial Fusion GPS firm to produce the infamous, largely-discredited anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele. CrowdStrike is a California-based cybersecurity technology company co-founded by Dmitri Alperovitch. Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, which takes a hawkish approach toward Russia. \u00a0The Council in turn is financed by Google Inc. In a perhaps unexpected development, another Atlantic Council funder is Burisma, the natural gas company at the center of allegations regarding Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Those allegations were the subject of Trump\u2019s inquiry with Zelemsky related to Biden. The Biden allegations concern significant questions about Biden\u2019s role in Ukraine policy under the Obama administration. This took place during a period when Hunter Biden received $50,000 a month from Burisma. Besides Google and Burisma funding, the Council is also financed by billionaire activist George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations as well as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc. and the U.S. State Department. Google, Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint alleging Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country\u201d in the 2020 presidential race. The charges in the July 22 report referenced in the whistleblower\u2019s document and released by the Google and Soros-funded organization, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s own claims, as Breitbart News documented. One key section of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document claims that \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.\u201d This was allegedly to follow up on Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky in order to discuss the \u201ccases\u201d mentioned in that call, according to the so-called whistleblower\u2019s narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations. Even though the statement was written in first person \u2013 \u00a0\u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me\u201d \u2013 it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). That footnote reads: In a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir. The so-called whistleblower\u2019s account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to: The OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a \u201cjoint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.\u201d BuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit. The OCCRP and BuzzFeed \u201cjoint investigation\u201d resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals. The so-called whistleblower\u2019s document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims. Another listed OCCRP funder is the Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. Together with Soros\u2019s Open Society, Omidyar also funds the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which hosts the International Fact-Checking Network that partnered with Facebook to help determine whether news stories are \u201cdisputed.\u201d Like OCCRP, the Poynter Institute\u2019s so-called news fact-checking project is openly funded by not only Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations but also Google and the National Endowment for Democracy. CrowdStrike and DNC servers CrowdStrike, meanwhile, was brought up by Trump in his phone call with Zelensky. According to the transcript, Trump told Zelensky, \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d In his extensive report, Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller notes that his investigative team did not \u201cobtain or examine\u201d the servers of the DNC in determining whether those servers were hacked by Russia. The DNC famously refused to allow the FBI to access its servers to verify the allegation that Russia carried out a hack during the 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, the DNC reached an arrangement with the FBI in which CrowdStrike conducted forensics on the server and shared details with the FBI. In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey confirmed that the FBI registered \u201cmultiple requests at different levels,\u201d to review the DNC\u2019s hacked servers. Ultimately, the DNC and FBI came to an agreement in which a \u201chighly respected private company\u201d\u2014a reference to CrowdStrike\u2014would carry out forensics on the servers and share any information that it discovered with the FBI, Comey testified. A senior law enforcement official stressed the importance of the FBI gaining direct access to the servers, a request that was denied by the DNC. \u201cThe FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated,\u201d the official was quoted by the news media as saying. \u201cThis left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier,\u201d the official continued. Biden, Ukraine and Burisma Ukraine in 2016 removed a key prosecutor probing alleged corruption involving Burisma, the same firm paying Hunter Biden. Joe Biden two years later admitted to personally threatening to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine unless the prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was removed. Biden publically boasted about his role in the removal of Shokin during a panel discussion sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018. \u201cI remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team \u2026 that we should be providing for loan guarantees. \u2026 And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, \u2026 we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, \u2018You have no authority. You\u2019re not the president.\u2019 \u2026 I said, call him. I said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. \u2026 I looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d After it was revealed that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014, ethics experts were quoted by the news media as raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. Yoshiko M. Herrera, a Russia and Eurasian policy expert from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, was quoted by the Washington Post saying that Biden\u2019s position was \u201ca conflict of interest even if it doesn\u2019t break any laws.\u201d \u201cCalling Hunter Biden a private citizen ignores the obvious links to the vice president,\u201d Herrera stated. \u201cConflict-of-interest rules should have applied. If Biden is working for the Obama administration on Ukraine, his son should not have been on the board of a company there that could be affected by U.S. policy spearheaded by his father.\u201d A New York Times editorial posited that Hunter Biden\u2019s role in the board of Burisma undermined his father\u2019s credibility in Ukraine issues. The newspaper opined: Sadly, the credibility of Mr. Biden\u2019s message may be undermined by the association of his son with a Ukrainian natural-gas company, Burisma Holdings, which is owned by a former government official suspected of corrupt practices. A spokesman for the son, Hunter Biden, argues that he joined the board of Burisma to strengthen its corporate governance. That may be so. But Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, has been under investigation in Britain and in Ukraine. It should be plain to Hunter Biden that any connection with a Ukrainian oligarch damages his father\u2019s efforts to help Ukraine. This is not a board he should be sitting on.

Some experts charge Clinton broke multiple laws, including\u00a018 U.S. Code \u00a7 1924, which forbids \u201cunauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material.\u201d And yet, the FBI determined in July 2016 that Clinton did not commit any crimes, yet characterized her email usage as \u201creckless.\u201d\u00a0 Then-FBI Director James Comey\u00a0infamously drafted a statement exonerating Clinton prior to the probe\u2019s completion. In June 2018, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz issued a stinging rebuke of the FBI\u2019s handling of the investigation. The federal watchdog\u2019s report labeled Comey\u2019s conduct during the probe as \u201cinsubordinate,\u201d though it said the bureau chief was found not to have been motivated by political bias or preference in his decisions to absolve Clinton.",

      "subtitle": "Tariq Ramadan, the prominent Islamic scholar charged in France with raping two women, is now under further investigation by police following more allegations of violent sexual assault.",
      "author": "Simon Kent",
      "content": " Ramadan, a Swiss national, 57, has already been charged in France with raping a disabled woman in 2009 and a feminist activist in 2012. The former Oxford University Professor of Islamic Studies denies all charges. He has also been accused of participating in the gang-rape of a journalist in her 50s with one of his staff when she went to interview the academic at a hotel in Lyon in May 2014. Paris prosecutors earlier this month instructed the investigating magistrate handling the case to look into the evidence from \u201ctwo new potential victims\u201d over incidents that allegedly took place in 2015 and 2016, a judicial source told AFP, confirming a report in Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper. Investigators took witness statements from the two women after they were identified from documents found on his computers. The women themselves have not filed a criminal complaint.  But they both say they were led into a brutal sexual relationship with Ramadan, one from November-December 2015 and the other in March 2016. \u201cIt was something other than physical rape, it went beyond that\u2026 there was a moral rape,\u201d one of the women said in her testimony seen by AFP. \u201cHe had such a hold on you that you did everything that he demanded. But this relationship was consensual, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked him to be milder, but he said \u2018it is your fault, you deserve it\u2019 and that he needed to be obeyed, which is what I did,\u201d the other said. Le Journal du Dimanche said prosecutors believe the two testimonies contained \u201cserious and concurring\u201d evidence that could incriminate Ramadan. Ramadan was taken into custody in February 2018 and held for over nine months before being granted bail. Authorities in Switzerland are also investigating him after receiving a rape complaint in that country while two other criminal complaints of rape have been filed relating to incidents in March 2018 and July 2019. The accused has in the last week gone on a media offensive to deny all the allegations against him, publishing a book called Duty of Truth and insisting all his relationships have been consensual. Ramadan, grandson of Hassan Al Banna who founded the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, denies any wrong doing and maintains his innocence. Ramadan\u2019s own supporters have previously used social media networks to\u00a0claim\u00a0his problems are all part of a \u201cZionist plot.\u201d  The married father of four was a professor at Oxford University until he was forced to take leave when rape allegations surfaced at the height of the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement in late 2017. Previous to that, Ramadan\u00a0was\u00a0banned\u00a0from entering the United States by\u00a0the George W. Bush administration in 2004 after it was alleged he\u00a0donated to the Association de Secours Palestinien (ASP/Palestinian Relief Organisation) from 1998 to\u00a02002. The U.S. government\u00a0considered the ASP a group that funded terrorism by giving some of their donations to the anti-Israel terrorist organisation Hamas which is proscribed in the U.S. Ramadan\u2019s U.S. travel ban was\u00a0later lifted\u00a0by then-Secretary of State Hillary\u00a0Clinton in 2010 during the Obama administration.

The book notes that Obama did not endorse Biden for president in 2020 either, marking a blow to his former vice president who routinely cites Obama\u2019s legacy on the campaign trail. Biden was also stung by the fact that Obama was meeting with potential presidential candidates such as former Rep. Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke, according to Livingston. The New York Times also reported in August that Obama told Biden, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Joe,\u201d referring to a conversation he had with his former vice president, and asked Biden\u2019s aids to not let the former vice president embarrass himself.

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Freeman, the assistant editor of the WSJ\u2019s editorial page, noted\u00a0that Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley (IA) and Ron Johnson (WI) wrote\u00a0Monday morning to Attorney General William Barr, asking if he has come up with any answers to the question of whether the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign used the government of Ukraine \u201cfor the express purpose of finding negative information on then-candidate Trump in order to undermine his campaign.\u201d Grassley originally wrote in July 2017 regarding whether the DNC and the Clinton campaign had used the Ukraine government in order to sabotage the Trump campaign. The senators continued: That letter also highlighted news reports that, during the 2016 presidential election, \u201cUkrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump\u201d and did so by \u201cdisseminat[ing] documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggest[ing] they were investigating the matter[.]\u201d Ukrainian officials also reportedly \u201chelped Clinton\u2019s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers.\u201d The plan involved\u00a0Alexandra Chalupa, reportedly a \u201cUkrainian-American operative\u201d consulting for the DNC. Chalupa \u201creportedly met with Ukrainian officials during the presidential election for the express purpose of exposing alleged ties between then-candidate Donald Trump, Paul Manafort, and Russia,\u201d Grassley and Johnson wrote to Barr. \u201cThe quotations come from a 2017 story in Politico, hardly a pro-Trump outfit,\u201d Freeman, co-author of Borrowed Time, observed, noting the headline, \u201cUkrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire.\u201d \u201cKiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president-elect after quietly working to boost Clinton,\u201d was the subheading, he pointed out. Politico\u00a0authors Kenneth Vogel and David Stern wrote in that article: Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton\u2019s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico\u00a0investigation found. The goal of Ukraine\u2019s reported aid to Clinton was to advance \u201cthe narrative that Trump\u2019s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine\u2019s foe to the east, Russia.\u201d Freeman noted: With the benefit of hindsight and the results of the Mueller investigation, it\u2019s now clear that there was no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia. What is not clear and what demands further investigation is how this baseless claim managed to consume the first two years of an American presidency. Though the idea of such an effort by Ukraine appeared unlikely to some, Vogel and Stern insisted: Politico\u2019s investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another\u2019s elections. Freeman concluded the Politico\u00a0investigation \u201cmay be helpful in figuring out exactly how the surveillance tools of America\u2019s national security apparatus were turned against the party out of power in 2016.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN), who represents northeastern Indiana in the U.S. House of Representatives, said in an exclusive interview on Breitbart News Saturday this weekend that he thinks the Democrats\u2019 impeachment push against President Donald Trump has not moved any supporters away from the president.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " \u201cThere is so much about this that\u2019s fishy,\u201d Banks said in the interview that aired on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel. \u201cThat\u2019s why when I hear from constituents back in northeast Indiana, they\u2019re so skeptical of all of this. I haven\u2019t heard from a single constituent or friend in the last few days that gives this any credibility except for those who are already part of the leftwing anti-Trump resistance to begin with. That\u2019s a sense to me that the American people have long dismissed these sort of swamp-created narratives like this one that they don\u2019t give it any credibility. If the Democrats had waged some sort of attempt over the past two and a half years to oppose the president on policy, and then this was the first time they talked about impeachment, then maybe people back home would take it more seriously, even if the facts don\u2019t add up. But at this point most of my constituents\u2014at least most of the ones I\u2019ve heard from that aren\u2019t a part of the resistance\u2014aren\u2019t giving it very much credibility at all.\u201d Banks added that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seems to have structured the impeachment investigation in a way that is designed to give out free publicity to many of her committee chairs, since there are a number of committees involved that probably should not be engaging in impeachment matters. \u201cIt\u2019s still hard to understand exactly what this process looks like. It\u2019s not a normal process,\u201d Banks said. \u201cYou have six different committees that will take up impeachment proceedings, including committees you might think of like the Judiciary Committee, but then you have committees that have no business getting into the impeachment business, like the Financial Services committee. What does that have to do with the impeachment proceedings? But here\u2019s what it has to do\u2014you have six different longtime Democrat figures like Maxine Waters on the Financial Services committee who wants her day in the sun, she wants to be on the evening news having had an impeachment hearing. You have all the Democrats clamoring for that. That\u2019s what this is all about. The Democrats are playing to their base, placating the far-left wing component of the Democrat base who want to go after this president and have kept going after him since he was inaugurated,and that\u2019s what\u2019s led us to where we are today.\u201d Banks pointed to Pelosi\u2019s interview on Morning Joe on MSNBC last week and noted that Pelosi seems to have given up on the possibility of a Democrat beating President Trump in 2020 and now is just going to try to smear him the best she can. \u201cShe said she was against impeachment because she didn\u2019t think he was worth it, but now that he might actually get re-elected, we need to go down the impeachment path\u2014which sort of echoes the words of a lot of other Democrats who have been on the impeachment train for a long time,\u201d Banks said. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re going after impeachment now is their premiere inevitable candidate isn\u2019t so inevitable anymore. You can\u2019t talk about the phone call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine without talking about the corruption of the Bidens and a $50,000 per month contract for Hunter Biden to sell influence and peddle access to his father, who was the vice president at the time, and overall to the Obama administration. So, there is a lot of irony here and the timing is suspect\u2014that deserves a lot more scrutiny.\u201d Banks added that Hunter Biden\u2019s arrangement with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma is on its face \u201ccorruption\u201d because there was no other reason for Hunter Biden to be working for the company other than to sell access to and influence over his father then-Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cIf that\u2019s not corruption, I don\u2019t know what corruption is,\u201d Banks said. \u201cPeddling access to your father and to the Obama administration because your last name is Biden\u2014I mean, he had no qualifications or any background at all in energy, he had no qualifications or any background at all in Ukraine or relationships in Ukraine or business in Ukraine. He had a $50,000 per month contract to be on the board of a company in Ukraine peddling access to his father who was the Vice President. Inherently, that is corruption and it deserves scrutiny.\u201d Banks also said he read the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president multiple times and has found nothing wrong with President Trump\u2019s conversation. in fact, he said he thinks what President Trump was doing was \u201cvery well-intentioned\u201d and part of a broader effort by the president to lift the \u201cdark cloud\u201d of the fake Russia collusion hoax that has hung over the country since the beginning of his presidency. \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, I\u2019ve read the transcript over and over and over again and there\u2019s something that strikes me about it\u2014I haven\u2019t heard anyone else talk about it. Maybe you can unpack this with me. It\u2019s almost like the president is suggesting if you have information that helps get to the bottom of how all of this Russian collusion hoax began with, started out with\u2014and maybe it included the Bidens, maybe it included Hillary Clinton, maybe it included Obama administration officials, then do me a favor and help us put it to bed so that our country can move on. It struck me, ever since I was sworn in as a new congressman at the same time that President Trump came to office, a couple of weeks later was inaugurated, our country has been hung up with a dark cloud over us of the Russian collusion hoax that has prevented us from fulfilling a mandate and an agenda that this president was elected to. Even in spite of that, this president has gotten great things done for our country, but there\u2019s so much more that we could have done if we wouldn\u2019t have been hung up in this day-by-day controversy of hoaxes brought out by Democrats who want to overturn the 2016 election. I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense, but as I read the transcript, it seems as though the president is very well-intentioned in what he is asking for.\u201d\n\nLISTEN TO GOP REP.

      "content": " In a Monday appearance on\u00a0The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\u00a0the CBS funnyman began by asking Clinton whether Congress should initiate an impeachment inquiry against Trump over a\u00a0phone call he made to Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky. Last Tuesday, Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced that she would initiate impeachment proceedings on the grounds that Trump \u201cabused his power by pushing Ukraine\u00a0to investigate his political rival,\u00a0Joe Biden.\u201d During the call, Trump asked his Ukranian counterpart to \u201clook into\u201d Biden\u2019s alleged financial interests in the country when he was vice president. \u201cWe learned about the Trump-Ukraine call, the private server \u2014 is it time to, dare I say, lock him up?\u201d Colbert asked Clinton, who appeared alongside her daughter Chelsea. \u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d \u201cWe have started an impeachment inquiry, which will look at the evidence, and I think that\u2019s exactly what should be done,\u201d Clinton responded. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that he was a corrupt businessman who cheated people, and we\u2019ve known that he and his campaign asked for aid from Russia, we\u2019ve known that.\u201d \u201cBut to see him in the office of the president, putting his own personal and political interests ahead of the national security of our country, just pierced through whatever confusion or denial people had,\u201d she continued.  Clinton also criticized her successor as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo amid reports that he had listened in to Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky.\u00a0\u201cHow many times when you were secretary of state did you have to say to Obama, \u2018You can\u2019t extort foreign countries to get dirt on your political enemies?\u2019\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cYeah, that never happened,\u201d she responded. \u201cThe Secretary of State\u2019s job is to\u00a0make sure he knows, number one, what the president is going to say on those calls. But because you\u2019ve got a president who doesn\u2019t listen to anybody and doesn\u2019t follow instructions whatsoever. I\u2019m not sure they haven\u2019t just given up on trying to give him any sort of preparation.\u201d The 71-year-old former First Lady also took aim at Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer and former Mayor of New York Rudy Guiliani, who reportedly\u00a0inquired\u00a0with Ukranian officials about Biden\u2019s and his son Hunter\u2019s dealings with Ukraine on behalf of the State Department. \u201cPresidents often use \u2014 as do secretaries of state \u2014 they might use an envoy or a special adviser to deliver a message,\u201d Clinton contended. \u201cBut again, it is supposed to be carefully thought through. And from what we\u2019ve seen on television, carefully thinking through is not one of Rudy\u2019s strong points.\u201d Clinton is currently doing a media tour to promote her new book, The\u00a0Book of Gutsy Women,\u00a0and hasn\u2019t minced her words with regard to her former Republican opponent. In a CBS interview on Sunday, she argued that despite his convincing electoral college victory, Trump \u201cknows he\u2019s an illegitimate president\u201d and her defeat felt like losing to a \u201ccorrupt human tornado.\u201d  Follow Ben Kew on\u00a0Facebook, Twitter at\u00a0@ben_kew,\u00a0or\u00a0email him at bkew@breitbart.com.",

A so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint, authored by a partisan federal bureaucrat, alleges President Donald Trump and\u00a0Giuliani sought to direct the government of Ukraine to look into the business activities of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, who previously received $50,000 monthly as a board member of a shady gas firm,\u00a0Burisma\u00a0Holdings, despite gaving no expertise in the energy sector. Last year, the former vice president boasted to the Council on Foreign Relations about\u00a0threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless a prosecutor looking into Burisma was fired. The complaint \u2014 based on\u00a0secondhand information, or hearsay \u2014 alleges President Trump asked Ukrainian\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky to probe the Biden family during a July 25th telephone call. Both the president and\u00a0Zelensky have denied any pressure was applied and the White House released a transcript of the world leaders\u2019 call in a nod to transparency. \u201cI think you read everything. I think you read text. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I \u2014 so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,\u201d Zelensky told reporters at the United Nations in New York City last week. Meanwhile, Giuliani has vehemently denied the allegations made by the anonymous Deep Stater and has sought to keep the focus on the Biden family\u2019s corruption. Giuliani\u2019s strategy has infuriated the Biden campaign, prompting them to demand all major television networks to keep the Trump lawyer off the air. \u201cWe are writing today with grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump. While you often fat check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough. By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation,\u201d the Biden campaign wrote in a letter to network executives. \u201cWe write to demand that in service to the fact, you no longer book Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump who has demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative.\u201d",

In June 2018, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz published a stinging rebuke of the FBI\u2019s handling of the probe, calling Comey\u2019s conduct \u201cinsubordinate,\u201d and yet, the watchdog stated the bureau director was found not to have been motivated by political bias or preference in his decisions to let Clinton off the hook.",

      "author": "John Hayward",
      "content": " Clinton infamously used the same phrase to refer to the half of the American electorate that supported the candidate who defeated her, current U.S. President Donald Trump. The Global Times praised Macau for following a more constructive path after it was handed over to China by Portugal 20 years ago, touting improvements in Macau\u2019s infrastructure and significant \u201cdiversification beyond the usual gambling economy.\u201d This was followed by truculent criticism of what Beijing sees as a horde of ungrateful young punks filling the streets of Hong Kong: Indeed, imploring Chinese youths of this region to understand their ancient and glorious past is something that regional economic and cultural cooperation is being fostered to do from Macao \u2014 much more so than the basket of deplorable, social media driven fantasies of certain fanatical teeny-boppers in Hong Kong. In fact, many silent majority in Greater China view these teeny-boppers as monstrous vandals. Communist China has been attempting to portray the Hong Kong uprising as an American plot to destabilize China, so the Clinton phrase was probably borrowed intentionally. Having failed to frighten Hong Kong into line by threatening to develop the nearby Chinese city of Shenzhen into its replacement, the Chinese Communist Party used the Global Times to warn that Macau might just become the new Hong Kong if the original continues to misbehave: Overall, in these days when Hong Kong is becoming sick, Macao is becoming a beacon of great health with good medicine, from the first medical school to embracing its brothers and sisters with medicine and education across Guangdong, to its Portuguese-speaking cousins across the world. When Macao celebrates the 20th anniversary of the handover in December, it will be clear to many that Macao has a new role in this region \u2013 and will for sure be aiming for new heights of history. Macau is actually in a bit of a slump right now. China\u2019s National Day holiday, commemorating the founding of the People\u2019s Republic, kicks off the annual \u201cGolden Week\u201d in Macau, essentially a big publicity stunt to attract tourism. Golden Week 2019 is currently running far below projections, in part due to the general economic slowdown in China. This could be exacerbated by the unrest in Hong Kong disrupting tourism across the area, although bullish Macau analysts expected Hong Kong\u2019s woes to boost their tourism as travelers sought alternative destinations.",

Clinton said, \u201cHe, obviously, used taxpayer funded assistance, passed by the Congress on a bipartisan basis, to both threaten an intimidate the new president of Ukraine, to investigate his political opponents for the purpose of advancing his own re-election. Now, that has so many elements in it and it\u2019s one of the reasons why I think it\u2019s broken through to the American people. It also is troubling that Ukraine has been a subject of constant pressure from Vladimir Putin and the Russian interests in Ukraine.\u201d She continued, \u201cSo you have the Trump administration, the president, the vice president, others actually pressuring a new president who has a part of his country invaded and occupied by Russian troops, and putting this poor new president in this vice. You think you are going to get military aid from us? Well, we have a favor to ask of you. Now, we know that the aggressiveness of Putin has been unchecked and, in fact, I would argue actually accelerated in both rhetoric and potential adverse actions to our interests because of what Trump has made clear that he supports and looks to Vladimir Putin. So Ukraine is a very specific example of what is at stake. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the only example that we could find if we looked at the transcripts of the calls with Vladimir Putin, for example.\u201d She added, \u201cWe still have no notes, no reporting about the many meetings and the many calls. we do know that in the oval office early in his term trump basically said to the foreign secretary of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, to the then Ambassador Kislyak \u2018Hey, I don\u2019t mind that interference in the election, wink-wink.\u2019 So this is about Ukraine, but Ukraine is the canary in the coal mine about what this president and his allies have been up to.\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The failed presidential candidate tweeted a clip of Trump telling a reporter that he hoped Ukraine would open an investigation examining Joe Biden\u2019s (D) questionable role in the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas company Burisma Holdings. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was taking in tens of thousands of dollars per month operating as a legal consultant for the company at the time. \u201cSomeone should inform the president that impeachable offenses committed on national television still count,\u201d Clinton wrote:  Democrats are accusing the president of \u201cpressuring\u201d the Ukrainian government into investigating Biden\u2019s role in Shokin\u2019s removal. A transcript of the conversation between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky shows that Trump\u2019s mention of a \u201cfavor\u201d was in reference to CrowdStrike \u2013\u00a0not Biden. Of Biden, Trump said: There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you \u00b7can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me. While the former vice president was mentioned later in the conversation, there is no evidence of quid pro quo, as impeachment-driven Democrats in the House suggest. Zelensky confirmed as much during a press conference with Trump this month. \u201cHave you felt any pressure from President Trump to investigate Joe Biden?\u201d a reporter asked. \u201cI think you read everything. I think you read text. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cNo, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I \u2014 so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn other words, no pressure,\u201d Trump added. Trump\u2019s claim in the phone call \u2013 that Biden bragged about getting the prosecutor fired \u2013 is correct. While Democrats assert that Trump was engaging in quid pro quo and generally impeachable behavior, it was Biden who threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid over the prosecutor\u2019s firing. \u201cI said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours,\u201d Biden said during a January 2018 appearance at the Council of Foreign Relations. \u201cI looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time,\u201d he added:  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) sent a scathing letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Thursday, demanding she halt the impeachment inquiry and answer a series of questions on the Democrat impeachment effort before proceeding: ",

      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " One of the co-founders of Whistleblower Aid previously worked at several liberal activist organizations financed by billionaire activist and Democratic Party megadonor George Soros. The other co-founder currently leads a separate organization that boasts on its four-person advisory board John Podesta, who led Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, served as Chief of Staff to Bill Clinton and founded the Soros-funded Center for American Progress pushing a progressive agenda. Working with the so-called DC whistleblower\u2019s lawyers, Whistleblower Aid set up a GoFundMe page seeking to raise funds for the purported whistleblower\u2019s defense. The page already brought in some $206,225 with a goal of raising $300,000.\n\nJohn Tye, co-founder of Whistleblower Aid, told Fox News that he is working with the so-called whistleblower\u2019s lawyers at the Compass Rose Legal Group. \u201cWe are very proud to be supporting this whistleblower. It is a very stressful thing to be a whistleblower,\u201d he said. Tye did not immediately return a Breitbart News interview request. Anti-Trump language scrubbed Whistleblower Aid was founded in September 2017 in the wake of Trump\u2019s presidency to encourage government whistleblowers to come forward. When Whistleblower Aid was first formed, the main banner for the mission statement of its website contained clearly anti-Trump language. \u201cToday our Republic is under threat. Whistleblower Aid is committed to protecting the rule of law in the United States and around the world,\u201d read the previous statement which can still be viewed via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. That part of the mission statement received attention in the conservative media. The sentence \u201ctoday our Republic is under threat,\u201d has since been scrubbed from the website.\u00a0 The mission statement now only reads, \u201cWhistleblower Aid is committed to protecting the rule of law in the United States and around the world.\u201d Speaking to the Washington Post just after Whistleblower Aid\u2019s founding, co-founder Tye claimed, \u201cThis is not a partisan effort,\u201d and then went on to express seemingly partisan alarm about Trump. Tye continued, \u201cAt the same time, yes, the rule of law starts with the office of the president. Like many other people, we are definitely concerned about things that are happening in the administration. The decision to fire [FBI Director] James Comey. The lack of transparency. A lot of people have questions about whether this administration respects the rule of law.\u201d Upon its founding, Whistleblower Aid actively sought to attract the attention of Trump administration government employees by reportedly blasting advertisements for its whistleblower services on Metro trains, using mobile billboards that circled government offices for 10 hours a day, and handing out whistles on street corners as a gimmick to gain attention. Far-left ties, Democrat links Tye himself is a whistleblower. He is a former State Department official who went public in 2014 about U.S. government electronic surveillance practices. Tye\u2019s bio on Whistleblower Aid\u2019s website brandishes his work for far-left groups. The bio reads: Mr. Tye has worked at the Southern Poverty Law Center, Avaaz, and also Southeast Louisiana Legal Services as a Skadden Fellow. He was on the board of directors of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. The Southern Poverty Law Center is known for its anti-conservative stance and controversially publishes a \u201chate map\u201d listing groups that warn about radical Islam such as Jihad Watch, the Clarion Project, the Center for Security Policy. On that same \u201chate map\u201d are racist extremist organizations like Global Crusaders: Order of the Ku Klux Klan and United Klans of America. Tye\u2019s other former employer, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), is financed heavily by Soros and is known for its hyper-partisan liberal activism. Avaaz, a radical group where Tye served as campaign and legal director, describes itself as a \u201cglobal web movement to bring people-powered politics to decision-making everywhere.\u201d The group has repeatedly engaged in anti-Israel activism. Channeling the mantra of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, Avaaz says it aims to \u201corganize citizens of all nations to close the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want.\u201d Avaaz was founded in 1997 by the Soros-funded, partisan MoveOn.org organization and by the Soros-funded Res Publica activist group. Tax forms from Soros\u2019s Open Society document donations to Res Publica specifically earmarked for support to Avaaz. Res Publica oversees Avaaz activism. The same year that Whistleblower Aid was founded, Avaaz\u2019s former general counsel and campaign director, Ian Bassin, in 2017 formed United to Protect Democracy. The latter is a grouping of former top lawyers for the Obama administration working to utilize legal advocacy methods to oppose Trump\u2019s policies. Bassin\u2019s United to Protect Democracy works in partnership with the Brennan Center for Justice, located at NYU School of Law. The Brennan Center is heavily financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations and is the recipient of numerous Open Society grants. Whistleblower Aid, meanwhile, was co-founded by attorney Mark S. Zaid. Zaid doubles as Executive Director and founder of the James Madison Project, which says it seeks to promote government accountability. John Podesta is a member of the Project\u2019s four-person advisory board. Common funding themes Whistleblower Aid\u2019s ties to Soros funding and far-left groups furthers a theme of such organizations being closely linked to numerous aspects of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint. Some of those common threads run through an organization repeatedly relied upon in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint and are tied to CrowdStrike, the outside firm utilized to conclude that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers since the DNC would not allow the U.S. government to inspect the servers. CrowdStrike founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council. The Atlantic Council is funded by and works in partnership with Burisma, the natural gas company at the center of allegations regarding Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Breitbart News reported that a staffer for Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence took a trip to Ukraine last month sponsored and organized by the Atlantic Council think tank. Schiff\u2019s office denied any impropriety. The Schiff staff member, Thomas Eager, is also currently a fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Congressional Fellowship. Burisma in January 2017 signed a \u201ccooperative agreement\u201d with the Council to sponsor the organization\u2019s Eurasia Center. Besides Burisma funding, the Council is also financed by Google as well as Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc. and the U.S. State Department. Google Capital also led a $100 million funding drive that financed Crowdstrike directly. Google, Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint alleging Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country\u201d in the 2020 presidential race. The charges in the July 22 report referenced in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document and released by the Google and Soros-funded organization, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s own claims, as Breitbart News documented. One key section of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document claims that \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.\u201d This was allegedly to follow up on Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in order to discuss the \u201ccases\u201d mentioned in that call, according to the so-called whistleblower\u2019s narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations. Even though the statement was written in first person \u2013 \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me\u201d \u2013 it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). That footnote reads: In a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir. The so-called whistleblower\u2019s account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to: The OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a \u201cjoint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.\u201d BuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit. The OCCRP and BuzzFeed \u201cjoint investigation\u201d resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals. The so-called whistleblower\u2019s document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims. Another listed OCCRP funder is the Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. Together with Soros\u2019s Open Society, Omidyar also funds the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which hosts the International Fact-Checking Network that partnered with Facebook to help determine whether news stories are \u201cdisputed.\u201d Like OCCRP, the Poynter Institute\u2019s so-called news fact-checking project is openly funded by not only Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations but also Google and the National Endowment for Democracy. CrowdStrike and DNC servers CrowdStrike, meanwhile, was brought up by Trump in his phone call with Zelensky. According to the transcript, Trump told Zelensky, \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d In his extensive report, Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller notes that his investigative team did not \u201cobtain or examine\u201d the servers of the DNC in determining whether those servers were hacked by Russia. The DNC famously refused to allow the FBI to access its servers to verify the allegation that Russia carried out a hack during the 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, the DNC reached an arrangement with the FBI in which CrowdStrike conducted forensics on the server and shared details with the FBI. In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey confirmed that the FBI registered \u201cmultiple requests at different levels,\u201d to review the DNC\u2019s hacked servers. Ultimately, the DNC and FBI came to an agreement in which a \u201chighly respected private company\u201d\u2014a reference to CrowdStrike\u2014would carry out forensics on the servers and share any information that it discovered with the FBI, Comey testified. A senior law enforcement official stressed the importance of the FBI gaining direct access to the servers, a request that was denied by the DNC. \u201cThe FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated,\u201d the official was quoted by the news media as saying. \u201cThis left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier,\u201d the official continued.

      "author": "Ann Coulter",
      "content": " What the phone transcripts demonstrate is that \u2014 unlike the typical Republican \u2014 Trump is not a let-bygones-be-bygones sort. He intends to find out who turned the FBI into a Hillary super PAC, using the powers of the nation\u2019s \u201cpremiere law enforcement agency\u201d (according to them) to take out a presidential candidate, and then a president. The whole picture becomes clear when you have the timeline. Instead of the FBI just admitting that it launched the Russia probe to help elect Hillary, the agency has given us a scrolling series of excuses for this partisan attack. The FBI\u2019s first claim was that it was merely investigating the hack of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email servers. As part of that effort, it was, naturally, obligated to spy on the Trump campaign. Then we found out that the John le Carre theory of Hillary\u2019s defeat was based exclusively on the word of a single cybersecurity firm. Yes, the FBI was SO frantic about the DNC\u2019s servers\u2026 that it didn\u2019t bother examining them itself. I repeat: The FBI never touched the DNC\u2019s servers. And who did? CrowdStrike. Who was CrowdStrike? A\u00a0Ukrainian-backed\u00a0cybersecurity firm. That\u2019s why Trump asked the Ukrainian president about CrowdStrike \u2013- the company behind the first of the FBI\u2019s many excuses for spying on Trump. On Jan. 10, 2017 \u2014 before Trump was even inaugurated \u2014 FBI Director James Comey breathed new life into the Russian collusion story by leaking news about the infamous Russian \u201cdossier.\u201d Hurray! The media were ecstatic. For the next 10 months, we got breathless reports about how this very important, totally credible, deeply concerning dossier might force Trump out of the White House! E.g.: \u2014 \u201cI remember pretty distinctly that you supported President Trump\u2019s criticism of this dossier\u2026 Do you want to\u00a0dial back that criticism now?\u201d \u2014 CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan to former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, April 19, 2017 \u2014 \u201cIf the dossier is now about to be publicly defended and explained and backed up, I mean, that\u2019s conceivably the whole ball game.\u201d \u2014 MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, Aug. 23, 2017 After carrying on about the dossier for nearly all of 2017, on Oct. 24 of that year, we finally found out who had paid for it: the Hillary Clinton campaign. (And you wonder why they don\u2019t want to give us the whistleblower\u2019s name.) This rather important datum was coughed up not by the media, but only in response to a court order.\u00a0Good work, \u201cwatchdog media\u201d! Nothing gets past you guys. Suddenly the dossier wasn\u2019t important at all. Where did Republicans get that idea? At this point, the FBI had to scramble to come up with an all-new explanation for why the bureau had put more than 100 agents \u2014 according to NBC News\u2019 Ken Dilanian \u2013- on an investigation of a presidential candidate. (Luckily, the bureau had lots of time, having already vanquished international terrorism.) Within a matter of days, on Oct. 30, the media was bristling with the news that the real reason the FBI put G-Men on the Trump campaign was: George Papadopoulos. (Don\u2019t stop reading! The sun is about to come out and all will be clear.) Up until Oct. 24, the media had barely mentioned the young campaign aide. But starting on Oct. 30, Papadopoulos became the lynchpin of the whole Trump-Russia conspiracy. It was a heavy lift. Papadopoulos had only met Trump once and, as The New York Times admitted, was \u201cso green that he listed Model United Nations in his qualifications.\u201d A few months later, in December 2017, the Russian collusion fairy tale took a hit when texts from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page showed FBI operatives at the heart of the so-called \u201cinvestigation\u201d vowing to use federal law enforcement resources to \u201cstop\u201d Trump. The FBI began frantically pumping up the Papadopoulos angle, telling the Times that it was their gob-smacking discovery in the summer of 2016 that Papadopoulos may have had \u201cinside information\u201d about Russia \u201chacking\u201d the DNC\u2019s email that was a \u201cdriving factor\u201d in the bureau\u2019s opening of the Russia-Trump investigation. So THAT\u2019S why the nation\u2019s No. 1 law enforcement agency had 100 agents investigating the Trump campaign! It sure took them a long time to come up with a reason. Pending results from Trump\u2019s phone call with the Australian president, Papadopoulos remains the FBI\u2019s current excuse for an \u201cinvestigation\u201d that wasted four years, millions of dollars and, in the end, turned up\u00a0nada. The story was, in the summer of 2016, Australian high commissioner to the United Kingdom Alexander Downer contacted the FBI claiming that Papadopoulos had admitted to him during a night of drinking that he knew the Russians had Hillary\u2019s emails. Two months later, Wikileaks began posting the DNC\u2019s emails! HOW ELSE CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT, UNLESS TRUMP WAS COLLUDING WITH RUSSIA? I can explain it. When Papadopoulos was blabbing to the Australian about the Russians having Hillary\u2019s emails,\u00a0everyone\u00a0was talking about the Russians having Hillary\u2019s emails \u2014 CNN, The Guardian, even ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View.\u201d (See\u00a0Resistance Is Futile!: How the Trump-Hating Left Lost Its Collective Mind.) Papadopoulos\u2019 \u201csource\u201d probably read it in The New York Times. Perhaps Downer is always completely oblivious to international news. Perhaps he spends too much time drinking with 28-year-olds. Trump\u2019s phone call with the president of Australia, released this week, suggests that we just might get to the bottom of the big Alexander Downer tipoff \u2014 the FBI\u2019s latest cover story. Now you know why all of official Washington, D.C., is screaming:\u00a0IMPEACH! They don\u2019t want you to find out that America\u2019s \u201cpremiere law enforcement agency\u201d tried to throw a presidential election and destroy a presidency.",

      "author": "Linda Tripp",
      "content": " Yet today\u2019s White House whistleblower has had a different experience from all the rest.\u00a0 Allies appear to have been lined up to assist, the skids were greased to move forward, the premise for blowing the whistle at all a concocted and rather flimsy one. It strains credulity already and the story has not yet been fully told. I fear we stand on a precipice today.\u00a0 I fear the loss of credibility for future whistleblowers all based on what we see today.\u00a0 With a created situation that, among other things, could endanger the already shaky and somewhat begrudging respect people may finally have for bona fide whistleblowers.\u00a0 The cause stands to be set back decades.\u00a0\u00a0 It is one of the reasons why we must pay close attention to how today\u2019s situation actually came to be. With all this in mind, I understand better than many how critical a role courageous whistleblowers play, whether in the private or the public sector.\u00a0 I enthusiastically support those hard fought protections we now have in place.\u00a0\u00a0 Protections for those who would risk everything to expose malfeasance, among other things, have been long coming.\u00a0 Bona fide whistleblowers deserve to be heard.\u00a0 To be protected against retaliation.\u00a0 To emerge whole on the other side. But in this unprecedented hyper partisan world in which we now find ourselves, other heretofore unheard of possibilities begin to rear their ugly heads . And we must face, however reluctantly, that a political operative with a partisan\u00a0 agenda, in fact, possibly a card carrying coup member, can also be cloaked in the\u00a0 federal protections provided to whistleblowers. And shouldn\u2019t be. At its core, it\u2019s all about patterns.\u00a0 Beginning on Election day November 2016 an attempt at a soft coup d\u2019\u00e9tat began in earnest.\u00a0 But it actually began long before.\u00a0 Startling and unprecedented, \u00a0this orchestrated endeavor was both systematic and systemic.\u00a0 The media and the Democrats (I repeat myself) have worked tirelessly toward this end hand in hand with the very real \u201cDeep State\u201d.\u00a0 In a burst of Hillary\u2019s favorite method, they used the politics of personal destruction to attempt to destroy Trump.\u00a0 And the pattern began. The calls for impeachment began before he even finished \u00a0his oath of office.\u00a0 It\u00a0 has continued every single day since.\u00a0 Not a day has gone by where some Democrat or talking head hasn\u2019t \u00a0called for impeachment.\u00a0 As unprecedented as this is, this pattern continues unabated to this day. Many will remember Chuck Schumer saying in a televised interview, \u201cLet me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.\u201d\u00a0 This \u00a0troubling pattern was established early on. And at the highest levels of our government.\u00a0 Blinded by partisan politics, they would put all their considerable efforts into removing this president. Now close to three years later, into this fray steps a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d.\u00a0 One of the six ways from Sunday, Mr. President. Keep in \u00a0mind that this pattern is the one that gives me pause.\u00a0 \u00a0As a former federal whistleblower, it is deeply troubling. It\u2019s the pattern that has taken all we hold sacred and turned it on its ear.\u00a0 It\u2019s the former director of the FBI and \u00a0the former heads of the intelligence agencies under President Obama who have literally lied publicly on the record to advance their Third World overthrow of a duly elected president. They\u2019ve adopted the old \u201cthrow everything at the wall to see what sticks\u201d game plan, with the fervent hope that finally they\u2019d get President Trump and get him good.\u00a0 Valiant efforts aside, it just has not worked.\u00a0 Highly placed public officials and elected officials are willing to check their integrity at the door in a misguided attempt to fix an election that they are convinced went so wildly wrong. We all know the movie.\u00a0 It was Russia.\u00a0 They told us so.\u00a0 From the very day he had the temerity to take office,\u00a0 President Trump was an agent of Putin.\u00a0 He colluded with the Russians to rig an election.\u00a0 He obstructed justice.\u00a0 He endangered national security.\u00a0 He was an existential threat to our democracy.\u00a0 And as the world recently watched, Hillary Clinton herself stated that he was an illegitimate president.\u00a0 Let those words sink in. The world also watched as Rep. Adam Schiff, the grandeur and gravitas of Capitol Hill as his backdrop, publicly stated that he had seen \u201cproof\u201d of Trump\u2019s Russian collusion.\u00a0 Proof. The president has been accused of everything from being a racist to being an anti-Semite. He has been held up to public ridicule and attacked from all sides.\u00a0 His nominees were by extension put through the wringer in an attempt to discredit Trump and to keep him from achieving any success in office.\u00a0 The shameful circus that was the Kavanaugh nomination attests to the lengths they would go to undermine this president.\u00a0 And in the end, and to date, none of the inquiries, investigations, accusations have proven anything other than the unadulterated hatred of the people behind the playbook. It has been the single most all consuming issue for the democrats since 2016.\u00a0 Legislation fell by the wayside because nothing, repeat nothing, was as important as removing this president.\u00a0 The six congressional committees working solely on impeachment should make that abundantly clear. And behind the scenes, mere steps from the White House, James Comey and his trusty cohorts on the lofty executive floor of the FBI building worked zealously before the election to ensure Trump\u2019s opponent won.\u00a0 And after the election they worked just as hard to find a way to remove Trump from office.\u00a0 The pattern was developing but it would be months before the intricacy would be revealed for all the world to see. Remember, it was Comey who leaked to his buddy to have his buddy leak to the media to prompt the appointment of a Special Counsel.\u00a0 No one disputes that.\u00a0 It worked. Enter Robert Mueller.\u00a0 Another Jim Comey buddy of long standing.\u00a0 Years later, 45 million tax dollars later, a somewhat befuddled Bob Mueller and his trusty band of Hillary donors came up with a great big goose egg.\u00a0 And a great deal of egg on their faces.\u00a0 No collusion.\u00a0 No obstruction. In any case,\u00a0 however you slice it, an exoneration was what it was. It was monumentally disappointing to them and even more crushing to the democrats and their buddies in the media, who had hung their many hats on a very different outcome.\u00a0 After all, they had all spent years assuring the American people that the Mueller Report would sink Trump\u2019s ship for once and for all. Impeachment would be the reward. And still, despite repeated failures, they didn\u2019t give up. So how does the playbook continue?\u00a0 It appears they now have their ace in the hole. Enter a bona fide, unassailable, federally protected \u201cwhistleblower\u201d. Checkmate. In light of the unmistakable pattern that emerged early on, we would do well to question that which would follow.\u00a0 It is so in the case of the \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d Consider this.\u00a0 Now we suspect this remarkably well protected \u201cwhistleblower\u201d may be a CIA employee who was sent by partisans loyal to John Brennan. Mr. Brennan has been rather vocal since the inauguration of President Trump and we don\u2019t have to guess where he stands on anything, least of all where it concerns this president. He has made it his life\u2019s work to destroy Donald Trump.\u00a0 His reputation is riding on it. He was and is a vital component of the coup.\u00a0 Watch the pattern.\u00a0 It should be troubling to all of us. Let\u2019s look back. \u201cDeath\u00a0 by a thousand knives\u201d was the well-oiled plan, and it was an orchestrated strategy.\u00a0 Talking points in hand, time after time, \u00a0this cabal worked valiantly\u00a0 to find grounds, any grounds, to unseat a duly elected president.\u00a0 They stopped and will stop at nothing.\u00a0 Their pattern became a playbook. I believe the possibility exists that our yet to be identified \u201cwhistleblower\u201d may well be a part of this playbook.\u00a0 A fox in sheep\u2019s clothing, so to speak. In our zeal to protect a \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d it is also our responsibility to ensure that in the process, the statute is not bastardized. \u00a0It means a deep dive into both sides.\u00a0 A deeper look at possible partisan collusion, motivation,\u00a0 connections, \u00a0into who placed this individual in this position, to determine whether this seemingly altruistic person is coming forward as a patriot or as a partisan.\u00a0 Based on all that has come before, and as horrifying as it may be, I would not be surprised to learn that the dirty hands of highly placed elected officials are behind this \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d Because when it concerns this president, the pattern cannot be ignored.\u00a0 Based on everything that came before, it is reasonable to question if all is actually as it might seem. As an impeachment inquiry looms, and as this movie plays on, we would do well to pay close attention.\u00a0 \u00a0To question where we are today by reviewing what came before. If nothing else, question the pattern.\u00a0 Because in the end, it might be important to consider an old saying I\u2019ve always liked.\u00a0\u00a0 A rose by any other name, they say, is still a rose.\u00a0 In this case, it\u2019s quite possible that a rat is still a rat.",

      "subtitle": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton publicly asked the People\u2019s Republic of China in May to release President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns \u2014 exactly the same act that Democrats and the media claim warrants impeachment.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Clinton, the defeated 2016 Democratic Party nominee for president, appeared on MSNBC\u2019s\u00a0Rachel Maddow Show\u00a0on May 1, 2019.\u00a0She repeated Trump\u2019s joke from July 2016 \u2014 which was taken seriously enough by President Barack Obama and the intelligence community to provide a pretext for eavesdropping on the Trump campaign \u2014 in which he said, \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 [Clinton] e-mails that are missing.\u201d As Breitbart News reported in May, the former secretary of state told Maddow that since Senate Republicans declined to pass Democrat-sponsored bills to secure American elections against foreign interference, the left should openly enlist the aid of Chinese espionage (transcript via MSNBC): Hillary Clinton:\u00a0The Republicans in the Senate wouldn\u2019t at all go forward with some of the\u00a0bipartisan legislation that was meant to secure our elections under orders\u00a0from the White House. \u2026 Imagine, Rachel, that you had one of the Democratic nominees for 2020 on\u00a0your show, and that person said, you know, the only other adversary of ours\u00a0who is anywhere near as good as the Russians is China. So, why should\u00a0Russia have all the fun?\u00a0 And since Russia is clearly backing Republicans,\u00a0why don\u2019t we ask China to back us. Rachel Maddow:\u00a0I hereby tonight ask China \u2013 Hillary Clinton:\u00a0 That`s right. And not only that, China, if you\u2019re listening, why\u00a0don\u2019t you get Trump\u2019s tax returns.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure our media would richly reward\u00a0you. Now according to the Mueller report, that is not conspiracy because it\u2019s\u00a0done right out in the open. So, if after this hypothetical Democratic candidate says this on your show,\u00a0within hours, all of a sudden, the IRS offices are bombarded with\u00a0incredibly sophisticated cyber tools looking for Trump\u2019s tax returns, and\u00a0then extracts and them and then passes them to whatever the new WikiLeaks\u00a0happens to be and they start being unraveled and disclosed \u2013 nothing wrong\u00a0with that. I mean, if you`re going let Russia get away with what they did and are\u00a0still doing according to Christopher Wray, the current FBI director, who\u00a0said that last week, they\u2019re in our election systems.\u00a0 We\u2019re worried about\u00a02020, he said. So, hey, let`s have a great power contest, and let\u2019s get the Chinese in on\u00a0the side of somebody else.\u00a0 Just saying that shows how absurd the situation\u00a0we find ourselves in. No one called for Clinton to be investigated, much less prosecuted. This week, however, Democrats and journalists alike declared that Trump deserved to be impeached for calling, openly, for China and Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption tied to former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate for the Democratic Party nomination. Democrats have been searching for Trump\u2019s old tax returns for years, convinced that they contain incriminating or at least politically embarrassing information. In 2017, Maddow produced his 2005 tax return \u2014 which showed he paid a significant amount in taxes. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "content": " \u201cDepression over the current field was swirling through my head the other day,\u201d Brown wrote in his latest column Saturday for the\u00a0San Francisco Chronicle, before a portrait of Muhammad Ali had him thinking about a \u201crematch.\u201d \u201cThink about it. Hillary is still the smartest of the bunch. She\u2019s also better known than any of the candidates, so she doesn\u2019t need a lot of money,\u201d Brown argued. \u201cClinton is the only candidate short of Barack Obama who has the brains, the battle-tested brawn and the national presence to take out Trump.

In February, he had already declared that none of the candidates \u2014 including his former girlfriend, Kamala Harris \u2014 could beat Trump. The Democratic candidates \u201call have impressive credentials, winning personalities and positive messages, but none displays the \u201cpeople personality\u201d that our media-savvy president has mastered,\u201d Brown wrote at the time. The most recent Public Policy Institute of California poll\u00a0showed Harris in a distant fourth among likely Democratic primary voters in her home state, while former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) were locked in a dead heat for first place. \u201cHowever, among voters with a candidate preference, more than half (53%) would consider supporting another candidate,\u201d the PPIC poll added.

      "subtitle": "The law firm representing the so-called whistleblower at the center of the impeachment movement targeting President Donald Trump as well as multiple other anti-Trump whistleblowers was so desperate to find Trump administration informants that they previously offered those who come forward discounted pricing for legal representation.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " A search of the Twitter account for the law firm\u2019s founder and managing partner, Andrew Bakaj, finds rabid anti-Trump posts such as repeated advocacy for Trump cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution over claimed competency issues. The amendment offers a path for the commander-in-chief\u2019s removal if the \u201cpresident is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\u201d Bakaj founded the Compass Rose Legal Group, which is representing the central so-called whistleblower on the matter of Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president. \u00a0Bakaj previously interned for Hillary Clinton and did work for other Democrats. On Sunday, Bakaj confirmed that his law firm is representing \u201cmultiple whistleblowers in connection to the underlying August 12, 2019, disclosure to the Intelligence Community Inspector General.\u201d \u201cNo further comment at this time,\u201d he added. Mark Zaid, senior counsel with the Compass Rose Legal Group, said on Sunday that his firm is representing a second so-called whistleblower in the Ukraine case. On Feb 15, 2017, toward the start of Trump\u2019s presidency, Bakaj and the firm each tweeted about the discounted pricing for potential Trump administration informants:   That same year, Zaid, Bakaj\u2019s partner at the firm, co-founded Whistleblower Aid, a small nonprofit that blasted advertisements around D.C. actively seeking whistleblowers during the Trump administration. On Twitter, Bakaj appealed for potential Trump-era whistleblowers to come forward:  \u201cYour loyalty is to the Constitution, not to an individual,\u201d Bakaj and the law firm told U.S. government clients.  Prior to Trump\u2019s inauguration, Bakaj tweeted that \u201cthe security of the nation rests with career federal employees (DoD, CIA, etc.) doing the right thing.\u201d  Bakaj repeatedly promoted the idea of invoking the 25th amendment to remove Trump from office:     At one point, Bakaj called on then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then-Defense Secretary James Mattis to take cabinet action and invoke the 25th amendment:  The activist lawyer referred to the Commander-In-Chief as \u201cPresident Drumpf.\u201d  In 2001, Bakaj interned for both Clinton and Senator Chuck Schumer. Zaid tweeted his firm would represent whistleblowers who believe Trump is a danger:  Meanwhile, missing from the avalanche of news media coverage \u00a0about the so-called whistleblower clients of Bakaj and Zaid is that at the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidency Zaid co-founded Whistleblower Aid. The group is heavily tied to far-left activist organizations and Democratic politics. In his twitter profile, Zaid describes himself as a \u201cnon-partisan\u201d attorney \u201chandling cases involving national security, security clearances, govt investigations, media, Freedom of Information Act, & whistleblowing.\u201d Missing from Zaid\u2019s twitter profile is that he co-founded Whistleblower Aid. That detail is also not mentioned in Zaid\u2019s bio on his attorney website. This even though Whistleblower Aid has been actively helping the first whistleblower also being represented by Zaid by setting up a GoFundMe page seeking to raise funds for the purported whistleblower\u2019s defense. The page already brought in some $210,066 with a goal of raising $300,000. Whistleblower Aid was founded in September 2017 in the wake of Trump\u2019s presidency to encourage government whistleblowers to come forward. The group did not sit around waiting for whistleblowers. Upon its founding, Whistleblower Aid actively sought to attract the attention of Trump administration government employees by reportedly blasting advertisements for its whistleblower services on Metro trains, using mobile billboards that circled government offices for 10 hours a day, and handing out whistles on street corners as a gimmick to gain attention. When Whistleblower Aid was first formed, the main banner for the mission statement of its website contained clearly anti-Trump language. \u201cToday our Republic is under threat. Whistleblower Aid is committed to protecting the rule of law in the United States and around the world,\u201d read the previous statement which can still be viewed via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. That part of the mission statement received attention in the conservative media. The sentence \u201ctoday our Republic is under threat,\u201d has since been scrubbed from the website.\u00a0 The mission statement now only reads, \u201cWhistleblower Aid is committed to protecting the rule of law in the United States and around the world.\u201d Speaking to the Washington Post just after Whistleblower Aid\u2019s founding, John Tye, who co-founded the organization with Zaid, claimed, \u201cThis is not a partisan effort,\u201d and then went on to express seemingly partisan alarm about Trump. Tye continued, \u201cAt the same time, yes, the rule of law starts with the office of the president. Like many other people, we are definitely concerned about things that are happening in the administration. The decision to fire [FBI Director] James Comey. The lack of transparency. A lot of people have questions about whether this administration respects the rule of law.\u201d Far-left ties, Democrat links Zaid doubles as Executive Director and founder of the James Madison Project, which says it seeks to promote government accountability.\u00a0 The Project features on its four-person advisory board John Podesta, who led Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, served as Chief of Staff to Bill Clinton and founded the Soros-funded Center for American Progress pushing a progressive agenda. Whistleblower Aid co-founder Tye himself is a whistleblower. He is a former State Department official who went public in 2014 about U.S. government electronic surveillance practices. Tye\u2019s bio on Whistleblower Aid\u2019s website brandishes his work for far-left groups. The bio reads: Mr. Tye has worked at the Southern Poverty Law Center, Avaaz, and also Southeast Louisiana Legal Services as a Skadden Fellow. He was on the board of directors of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. The Southern Poverty Law Center is known for its anti-conservative stance and controversially publishes a \u201chate map\u201d listing groups that warn about radical Islam such as Jihad Watch, the Clarion Project, the Center for Security Policy. On that same \u201chate map\u201d are racist extremist organizations like Global Crusaders: Order of the Ku Klux Klan and United Klans of America. Tye\u2019s other former employer, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), is financed heavily by billionaire activist and Democratic Party mega-donor George Soros and is known for its hyper-partisan liberal activism. Avaaz, a radical group where Tye served as campaign and legal director, describes itself as a \u201cglobal web movement to bring people-powered politics to decision-making everywhere.\u201d The group has repeatedly engaged in anti-Israel activism. Channeling the mantra of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, Avaaz says it aims to \u201corganize citizens of all nations to close the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want.\u201d Avaaz was founded in 1997 by the Soros-funded, partisan MoveOn.org organization and by the Soros-funded Res Publica activist group. Tax forms from Soros\u2019s Open Society document donations to Res Publica specifically earmarked for support to Avaaz. Res Publica oversees Avaaz activism. The same year that Whistleblower Aid was founded, Avaaz\u2019s former general counsel and campaign director, Ian Bassin, in 2017 formed United to Protect Democracy. The latter is a grouping of former top lawyers for the Obama administration working to utilize legal advocacy methods to oppose Trump\u2019s policies. Bassin\u2019s United to Protect Democracy works in partnership with the Brennan Center for Justice, located at NYU School of Law. The Brennan Center is heavily financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations and is the recipient of numerous Open Society grants.

      "subtitle": "Appearing Tuesday on\u00a0PBS NewsHour, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton defended former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, against allegations of corruption in China and Ukraine, claiming there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that the pair \u201cdid anything wrong.\u201d",

      "content": "  A transcript is as follows: JUDY WOODRUFF: Former Vice President Joe Biden clearly a part of [the Ukraine matter]. His name came up during [the Trump-Zelensky] call. Whether he did or didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u00a0\u2014 and there\u2019s no proof that he did\u00a0\u2014 President Trump keeps bringing that up, is there an optical problem for Joe Biden because he son was in a position to be making a lot of money from a company that was in a foreign country? HILLARY CLINTON:\u00a0You know, Judy, this is the goal of the Trump strategy: It is to raise questions. There is no evidence that either one of them did anything wrong. Could there be a question of judgment about his son? Well, that\u2019s fair game. But there is absolutely no evidence, and there will not be any evidence, that Joe Biden did anything wrong. Enough with these wild unfounded conspiracy theories. Using the help of foreign governments to interfere in our election and to undermine people who have been in the public eye for a long time and I hope the American people reject this, as they should. In recent days, President Donald Trump has suggested China and Ukraine investigate alleged corruption committed by the Biden family.\u00a0As Breitbart News extensively reported, Hunter Biden\u2019s investment company scored a\u00a0$1.5 billion investment deal\u00a0with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013. Further,\u00a0then-vice president\u00a0Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating the gas giant Burisma Holdings, which was paying Hunter Biden $83,000 monthly as a member of its board, despite his lack of expertise in the energy sector. Biden later\u00a0boasted\u00a0before the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. Clinton may have a personal dog in this fight, as the Biden allegations first came from a book by Peter Schweizer \u2014 investigative journalist, president of the Government Accountability Institute, and senior contributor to Breitbart News \u2014 called Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends. The book functions as a spiritual sequel to Schweizer\u2019s\u00a0Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich. That book\u2019s findings, confirmed even by Democrat-friendly corporate media, became a major problem for her campaign and may have helped in the decline of The Clinton Foundation.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The failed presidential candidate tweeted a video from a Washington, DC, stop of her Gutsy Women tour and resurrected the Russian narrative, alluding to GOP-Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d and expressing strong support for the Democrat-led House impeachment inquiry.  All bets are off. If foreign governments think they can tilt the playing field as they did against me, which was a deliberate, well planned out effort laid out in an indictments against Russian military actors and their allies\u2013 Well, you know, Republicans seem to think that, \u2018Ok, so far Russia\u2019s playing on the red team. You know. So we like it. We\u2019re not going to stand up against it.\u2019 Well, who\u2019s to say that next week they\u2019re going to be playing on the blue team? It\u2019s crazy my friends. However, Clinton failed to mention the well-documented Ukrainian efforts to sink Trump and boost her campaign. The former secretary of state continued, calling the partisan-fueled impeachment inquiry the \u201cappropriate remedy\u201d to the \u201cserious assault on our democracy that is apparently asked for.\u201d \u201cSo impeachment is the appropriate remedy, and it is such a serious assault on our democracy that is apparently asked for, aided and abetted by not only the president but his allies who seem not to either care or understand how deeply dangerous this is,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI am all in favor of what the House is doing and gathering the evidence and making the case because this president has to be held to account because of his unconstitutional abuse of power, his contempt of Congress, and his obstruction of justice,\u201d she added. President Trump suggested on Tuesday that \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d should join the race \u201cto try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren\u201d on the condition of explaining \u201call of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u2018C\u2019 Subpoena!\u201d Clinton replied, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job,\u201d fueling speculation that she is considering another presidential run.  Clinton recently floated the possibility of a rematch on PBS NewsHour: You know, it truly is remarkable how obsessed he remains with me. But this latest tweet is so typical of him. Nothing has been more examined and looked at than my emails. We all know that. So, he\u2019s either lying or delusional, or both. There was no subpoena, as he says in a tweet this morning. So, maybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again. But, just seriously, I don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation. Clinton is expected to host \u201cDinner and a Conversation\u201d in her Washington, DC, home this month in partnership with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Women\u2019s Leadership Forum, adding to the speculation of another presidential bid on the horizon.",

      "subtitle": "One of the many news-making revelations in Ronan Farrow\u2019s upcoming book,\u00a0Catch and Kill, is that he received pressure from Hillary Clinton to back off his reporting on Harvey Weinstein.",
      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " The far-left Hollywood Reporter, which received an advanced copy of the book, naturally buried this bombshell under no fewer than 20 paragraphs and a headline that says nothing about Madame Clinton. What we also learn is that while Weinstein\u2019s move to leverage his relationship with Hillary Clinton was successful in putting pressure on Farrow, Weinstein was not able to leverage his relationship with filmmaker Woody Allen (Weinstein financed and produced a number of Allen\u2019s films) to help him with Farrow. Allen, who is Farrow\u2019s father, reportedly told the soon-to-be-disgraced mogul, \u201cJeez, I\u2019m so sorry. Good luck.\u201d Here\u2019s the relevant Hollywood Reporter excerpt (emphasis mine): Weinstein also attempted to leverage his long-term relationship with Hillary Clinton to pressure Farrow, he writes. In summer 2017, while Farrow was trying to lock down an interview with Clinton for his foreign policy book \u2014 while also still working on the Weinstein story \u2014 he received a call from Clinton\u2019s publicist, Nick Merrill, who told him that the \u201cbig story\u201d Farrow was working on was a \u201cconcern for us.\u201d Then, in September 2017, according to an email cited in the book, Weinstein wrote to Deborah Turness, the ex-president of NBC News who now runs NBC News International, to propose a docuseries on Clinton. \u201cYour Hillary doc series sounds absolutely stunning,\u201d Turness responded. Weinstein\u2019s tentacles even stretched to Farrow\u2019s own estranged father. Days before the\u00a0Times\u00a0story broke, Weinstein is said to have called Allen on a film set in Central Park, soliciting advice about how to deal with his son. Allen declined: \u201cJeez, I\u2019m so sorry. Good luck.\u201d Please note that Merrill is Hillary\u2019s longtime publicist. He works for her, and it seems unlikely he would do such a thing without her instructions. What\u2019s more, as of now, Merrill has not denied the reporting. To understand just how awful Hillary\u2019s behavior is here, you have to keep in mind the context of the time, of what was happening in 2017. To begin with, as Breitbart News reported in December 2017, there are credible reports Hillary Clinton had known about Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct and abuse going back to her failed 2016 presidential campaign. From the far-left New York Times: [T]wo prominent women said they warned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team. In 2016, Lena Dunham, the writer and actress, said she was troubled by the producer\u2019s visible presence during Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential run, hosting fund-raisers and appearing at campaign events. \u2026 \u201cI just want you to let you know that Harvey\u2019s a rapist and this is going to come out at some point,\u201d Ms. Dunham said she told Kristina Schake, the campaign\u2019s deputy communications director. She recalled adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s a really bad idea for him to host fund-raisers and be involved because it\u2019s an open secret in Hollywood that he has a problem with sexual assault.\u201d \u2026 Ms. Dunham said she also warned Adrienne Elrod, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton who was leading efforts with celebrity campaigners. As far as Ms. Dunham could tell, the campaign had not responded to her concerns about Mr. Weinstein. Weeks before Election Day, the producer helped organize a star-packed fund-raiser: an\u00a0evening\u00a0on Broadway with Julia Roberts, Anne Hathaway and others. But even without this reporting, what we also know is that Weinstein\u2019s alleged misconduct and abuse were no secret in Hollywood and Washington, DC. Report after report after report confirm that \u201ceveryone knew,\u201d but no one did anything because 1) Weinstein had the power to make or break your Hollywood career and 2) Weinstein raised a ton of money for Democrats \u2014 most especially, the Clintons; most especially, Hillary Clinton. On top of that, at the time, it was no secret Farrow was working on what would be a Pulitzer-winning Weinstein expos\u00e9. Everyone knew because Farrow was reaching out to everyone to put the story together. According to Farrow, Weinstein understood this report could completely destroy his life, career, and reputation (which it did), and so, the Oscar-winning producer went so far as to try to intimidate Farrow, using everything from spies to threats aimed at Farrow\u2019s employers at NBC News. Farrow says Weinstein told NBC he would expose the network\u2019s top star, Matt Lauer \u2014 \u00a0meaning the alleged sexual misconduct that eventually unraveled the Today Show anchor\u2019s career. For the record, NBC News denies being threatened with Lauer. Nevertheless, NBC did refuse to run Farrow\u2019s Weinstein story. Eventually, the far-left news outlet sent its own reporter and his bombshell story down the road to the New Yorker, where Farrow would not only win a Pulitzer, but launch the #MeToo movement that took down Lauer anyway. Anyway, this Hillary Clinton bombshell could not come at a worse time for the two-time presidential loser, a time when she appears to be seriously flirting with the idea of a 2020 rematch with President Trump. She might want to remember that during their 2016 battle, Trump was not afraid to remind voters that Hillary played a leading role to personally destroy the women who claimed to have been raped, abused, molested, and mistreated by her husband, former President Bill Clinton.

The former secretary of state fueled the rumors after tweeting, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me\u201d in response to the president\u2019s daring her to run again:  She also\u00a0told\u00a0PBS\u00a0NewsHour\u00a0that Trump is \u201cobsessed\u201d with her and suggested that she could beat him in a rematch. \u201cMaybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, just seriously, I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\u201d",

I guess predators are her style.\u201d McGowan made the comments in reference to a report that Hillary Clinton\u2019s\u00a0publicist Nick Merrill told investigative journalist Ronan Farrow that his investigation into\u00a0Harvey Weinstein\u2019s alleged history of sexual misconduct was \u201ca concern\u201d for her client\u2019s reputation.

(Evan Agostini/Getty Images) President Bill Clinton and Miramax Chief, Harvey Weinstein at Hillary Clinton\u2019s Birthday Party at the Hudson Hotel in New York City. October 25, 2000 (Nick Elgar/ImageDirect) Both Bill and Hillary Clinton were known to have a relationship with Weinstein, who was at the time one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. The disgraced film producer was also a prominent Democratic Party donor, giving substantial sums to The Clinton Foundation as well as Bill Clinton\u2019s legal defense fund during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. \u201cHillary Clinton, did you have any concern for your husband\u2019s victims? And what about HW victims? No? Didn\u2019t think so,\u201d added McGowan, who was one of the first women to accuse Weinstein of sexual assault.  Merrill denied Farrow\u2019s claims, suggesting that Weinstein may have exaggerated his amount of leverage over the Clinton family. \u201cI genuinely respect Ronan\u2019s work, but have no idea what Weinstein was saying to people to save himself. What I do know is simple: I\u2019d already rejected a Weinstein Co proposed doc about the election before talking to Ronan. If HW misrepresented facts, it wouldn\u2019t be the 1st time,\u201d Merrill said.  Weinstein pleaded\u00a0not guilty to various charges of rape and sexual assault. His trial is scheduled for January in New York. \u201cI am against abuse of power, whether it be Trump, Clinton, [Harvey Weinstein,] ABC\u2026 the list is long,\u201d McGowan added.

The one issue Hillary and Chelsea don\u2019t appear to agree on entirely is transgender self-identification. In an interview with the Sunday Times, journalist Decca Aitkenhead asked the Clintons if someone with a beard and a penis can ever be a woman, to which Chelsea replied emphatically, \u2018Yes.\u2019 But Aitkenhead reported that Hillary seemed \u201cuneasy\u201d about the subject. \u201cErrr.

The Daily Mail reported. According Aitkenhead\u2019s account, she tells Hillary during the interview that many British feminists of Hillary\u2019s generation have a problem with the idea that\u00a0a \u2018lesbian who doesn\u2019t want to sleep with someone who has a penis is transphobic. The journalist then adds that many women of Hillary\u2019s generation are uncomfortable with biological males sharing women\u2019s bathrooms. \u201cI would say that, absolutely,\u201d Hillary said. \u201cAbsolutely. Yes.\u201d Chelsea, meanwhile, expressed approval of the British National Health Service\u2019s decision to assign patients to single sex wards based on their gender identity instead of their biological sex. \u201cHow can you treat someone if you don\u2019t recognize who they feel and know in their core they are?\u201d Chelsea said. \u201cAnd I strongly support children being able to play on the sports teams that match their own gender identity.\u201d \u201cI think we need to be doing everything we can to support kids in being whoever they know themselves to be and discovering who they are,\u201d Chelsea said.

      "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/14/2020-democrats-unified-for-more-immigration/",
      "subtitle": "Despite efforts to draw distinctions between each other, the leading 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidates are unified to bring more immigration, and thus more labor market competition for American workers, to the United States if elected.",
      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " Though polling among all U.S. voters, and particularly with swing voters, finds campaigning for immigration, illegal and legal, is the most unpopular policy position, leading candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have gone above and beyond past Democrat candidates in their vows to drive a large migration to the country. That increase in immigration would likely have significant consequences for states like Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. As research by the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Axios,\u00a0experts, and demographers has repeatedly discovered, an increase in the foreign-born population via immigration inevitably translates to an increase in likely Democrat voters. At current legal immigration levels, the U.S. is already on track to bring at least 15 million new foreign-born voters to the country in the next decade. These voters\u2019 swing towards Democrats has already been realized in the 2016 presidential election, where despite winning almost 50 percent of native-born Americans, Trump lost foreign-born voters to Hillary Clinton by 64 percent. Elizabeth Warren Warren has portrayed her run for president as a populist movement, similar to that of Sanders\u2019 and Trump\u2019s campaigns in the 2016 presidential election, but her immigration platform is a carbon copy of the donor class\u2019s and Washington, D.C. beltway\u2019s longtime effort to force down wages for Americans by increasing legal immigration levels. Aside from promising to decriminalize illegal immigration and provide free taxpayer-funded healthcare to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens, Warren is seeking to gift the big business lobby with a massive increase in legal immigration \u2014 levels which are already historically high, as at least 1.2 million legal immigrants are added to the U.S. population every year. That increase in legal immigration, Warren has said, will include an increase in chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. Today, chain migration makes up more than 70 percent of all legal immigration, and in the last decade the process has brought almost 10 million foreign nationals to the U.S. Like her legal immigration agenda, Warren plans to surge refugee resettlement to the country by at least 700 percent. As Breitbart News has chronicled, mass fraud is prevalent in the refugee system, with African refugees often fraudulently obtaining refugee status. Joe Biden Biden has been less direct about his plan to increase immigration to the U.S. Like the majority of 2020 Democrats, he has endorsed providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens, a plan that healthcare experts have said will drive a migration of illegal aliens with \u201cserious health problems\u201d to the country. Biden\u2019s strategy to increase immigration, though, has been to provide green cards to all foreign students who graduate from American universities and to bring as many legal immigrants to the country as feasibly possible \u2014 regardless of its impacts on U.S. citizens and workers. Biden said in August: We could afford to take in a heartbeat another two million people. The idea that a country of 330 million people cannot absorb people who are in desperate need \u2026 is absolutely bizarre \u2026 I would also move to increase the total number of immigrants able to come to the United States.\u201d In 2013, while speaking to the financial industry, Biden touted a plan to increase the number of H-1B foreign visa workers that corporations are allowed to import to replace American workers. Every year, more than 100,000 foreign workers are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are\u00a0about 650,000 H-1B visa\u00a0foreign\u00a0workers\u00a0in the U.S. at any given moment. Americans are\u00a0often\u00a0laid off\u00a0in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as\u00a0highlighted\u00a0by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program. Bernie Sanders Sanders has on occasion denounced the idea of open borders, calling such a policy a \u201cKoch brothers proposal\u201d to drive down the wages of American workers by forcing them to compete against the world\u2019s workforce. \u201cIt would make everybody in America poorer,\u201d Sanders said in 2015 of open borders. Sanders has revisited that sentiment in his 2020 presidential campaign \u2014 even calling for more detention space for border crossers to end Catch and Release \u2014 but his broader immigration plan reflects that of the open borders lobby. For example, Sanders\u2019 latest plan ends deportations of illegal aliens and border crossers, decriminalizes illegal immigration, and promotes the DREAM Act, which would provide amnesty to the majority of illegal aliens currently living in the U.S., creating a new flood of legalized foreign labor that American workers would be forced to compete against. Where Sanders has differed from his two top contenders is on his plan to make subtle changes to the H-1B visa system and prevent American workers from having to compete against illegal aliens for U.S. jobs. Like Trump, Sanders has warned against corporations using the H-1B visa program to import cheaper foreign workers instead of hiring qualified and job-ready Americans. Out of all the 2020 Democrats running for president, Sanders is the only candidate who earns a \u201cmixed\u201d review from NumbersUSA\u2019s scorecard, the organization that tracks the records of politicians on whether or not they support less immigration to boost wages and job opportunities for Americans. Sanders is the only 2020 Democrat that has mostly endorsed nationwide mandatory E-Verify to ban U.S. companies from hiring illegal aliens over American citizens. Nonetheless, Sanders\u2019 support for mass amnesty, critics have said, will mean that those illegal aliens currently in the country would be able to eventually compete against Americans in the workforce and pass through the E-Verify system.

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " In an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriot\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight, Coulter describes how the establishment media never sees populist-nationalist movements coming despite history often repeating itself. LISTEN:  \u201cEvery decade or so somebody comes along \u2014 Pat Buchanan, Ross Perot, Donald Trump \u2014 and says essentially the same things, you know, defends the working class Americans and put Americans before Wall Street and every time the media is shocked,\u201d Coulter said. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s weird, this guy just speaks the truth and it\u2019s popular, how did that happen?\u2019 It happens every time.\u201d In the 2016 presidential election, while Trump campaigned on a platform of less immigration, less free trade, and less foreign intervention, his opponent Hillary Clinton vowed to continue the neoconservative-neoliberal agenda that has ruled Washington, D.C. for the last three decades. On election night, the establishment media was left shocked after they falsely predicted that Clinton would beat Trump, as detailed by Breitbart News\u2019s John Nolte. Coulter said 2020 Democrats are seemingly mimicking the establishment media\u2019s out-of-touch behavior by endorsing a whole host of far-left cultural issues like transgender surgery for children and drag queen storytime for toddlers. \u201cAll of the cultural stuff, the gay marriage, the transgenders, the drag queen holidays \u2026 please let them keep talking about that,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cIt gets a lot of applause at the Democrat debates, but out in America there are a lot of Democrats \u2014 I\u2019m not entirely sure why they\u2019re Democrats and they haven\u2019t figured out that the party hates them \u2014 the more they wake up normal, middle class, and working class Americans of every race, color, and creed to realize that the Democrat Party, they are the party of the very, very wealthy, and they are foot soldiers, you know whoever is willing to riot and shoot cops on their side,\u201d Coulter said.

Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) broke from her radical colleagues during the Ohio debate Tuesday night by stating abortion should be \u201csafe, legal, and rare,\u201d and indicating she would, if elected president, work to restrict most abortions in the third trimester of pregnancy.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " CNN debate host Erin Burnett asked the candidates how, as president, they would block states whose elected representatives vote to ban or restrict abortion. \u201cThis is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make, and it\u2019s unfortunate to see how in this country it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon,\u201d Gabbard responded, and continued: I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she\u2019s correct. We see how the consequences of laws that you\u2019re referring to can often lead to a dangerous place, as we\u2019ve seen them as they\u2019re passed in other countries, where a woman who has a miscarriage past that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point. I do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that, during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk. On Saturday, the New York Times published a piece attacking Gabbard in advance of the debate as a right-wing extremist with \u201csuspicious activity\u201d around her campaign. Breitbart News reported: The\u00a0Times\u00a0article, \u201cWhat, Exactly, Is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?,\u201d claims that Gabbard is beloved by white nationalists, antisemites, and Russians attempting to interfere in the election, citing \u201csuspicious activity\u201d around her campaign. While Gabbard has broken from her fellow Democrat candidates in stating restrictions should be placed on abortion, she is not up to date on Hillary Clinton\u2019s most current views on the issue if she is using the failed candidate as a reference point. Both Bill and Hillary Clinton said over 25 years ago that abortion is a \u201cfundamental constitutional right\u201d and should be \u201csafe, legal, and rare.\u201d In 2008, Clinton repeated she wanted abortion, \u201csafe, legal and rare, and by rare, I mean rare,\u201d as the pro-life LifeNews reported. Eight years later, however, when Clinton was running for president \u2014 and received the endorsement of Planned Parenthood \u2014 she clearly said unborn babies have no constitutional right to life, even up until their due date. In April, Clinton\u00a0responded\u00a0to\u00a0The View\u00a0co-host Paula Faris when asked about her comments that an unborn child has no constitutional rights: Under our law that is the case, Paula. I support Roe versus Wade because I think it is an important \u2014 an important statement about the importance of a woman making this most difficult decision with consultation by whom she chooses: her doctor, her faith, her family. And under the law and under certainly that decision, that is the way we structure it. After losing the 2016 presidential election to Donald Trump, Clinton wrote in her book What Happened that pro-life Democrats must vote against their principles and in favor of legislation that promotes abortion rights. \u201cBut when personal views on abortion become public actions \u2014 votes on legislation or judges or funding that erode women\u2019s rights \u2014 that\u2019s a different matter,\u201d Clinton wrote about whether views on abortion should be a litmus test for Democrat Party candidates. \u201cWe have to remain a big tent, but a big tent is only as strong as the poles that hold it up.\u201d In January, Clinton joined New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to push for a state measure \u2014 which he ultimately signed into law \u2014 that would permit abortions \u201cat any time\u201d a patient\u2019s health needs to be protected. Pro-life activists and medical providers noted that allowing abortion \u201cat any time\u201d a patient\u2019s \u201chealth\u201d needs to be protected is purposefully vague.",

You were doing an interview on a separate project, here spokesman calls and says that they had concerns about the Weinstein story at NBC. Did you feel pressure from Hillary Clinton on this?\n\nRONAN FARROW:\u00a0Like everything else in the book, Bret, this is handled in a very measured way. The book is meticulously fact-checked, we had long conversations with everyone discussed in it, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s people, and it\u2019s extremely fair to her. I can\u2019t speak to her state of mind. What I can say is\u00a0she attempted to withdraw from an interview that she had committed to for a foreign policy book I was working on, for which I interviewed every other living secretary of State. And, before doing so, her staff raised concerns about the fact that I was working on this story about one of her most significant donors, a big bundler of Hollywood money. BAIER: At one point, NBC kills your story. Are you demoralized, do you think it\u2019s going to see the light of day? FARROW: The fundamental fact here is that I took reporting that this network looked at, and you can read the book for yourself, and took it across the street to the New Yorker, and in just a matter of weeks, it became a\u00a0Pulitzer Prize-winning body of reporting. I owe that to the bravery of my sources, I owe it to incredible editors there, and I think that it tells an important story about the circles of mutual protection and power in our business, the media, and the need to hold ourselves accountable. That\u2019s true of CBS, where I did reporting on allegations of misconduct and secret settlements there. It\u2019s true of Fox, which has done a great job at confronting some of the issues here, including the use of secret settlements, and now there\u2019s tough conversations about this at NBC.",

      "content": " The failed 2016 Democrat nominee,\u00a0who has accused President Donald Trump of being Russia\u2019s \u201cpuppet\u201d in the past,\u00a0made the remarks during an interview on David Plouffe\u2019s Campaign HQ podcast, while discussing Russian interference. Clinton\u00a0suggested during the exchange that Russian President Vladimir Putin was grooming a stalking horse candidate to ensure Trump would be reelected. \u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians.\u201d Clinton also added she believed Jill Stein, the likely Green Party nominee for president, is a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d  Although Clinton did not mention the candidate by name, many on social media interpreted the statement to be an attack on Gabbard.   Even prior to announcing her presidential bid, Gabbard stood apart from the rest of the Democrat field for her willingness to challenge the party\u2019s foreign policy status quo, especially when it comes to regime change. Such independence has not, however, engendered praise for the congresswoman on the left. Instead, many have attempted to smear Gabbard as both an \u201cextremist\u201d and \u201capologist\u201d for dictators, the latter resulting in her refusal to condemn Syria\u2019s strongman Bashar al-Assad. In particular,\u00a0the New York Times ran a piece on the congresswoman earlier this week, painting her as a right wing extremist.\n\n\u201cThen there is 4chan, the notoriously toxic online message board, where some right-wing trolls and anti-Semites fawn over Ms. Gabbard, calling her \u2018Mommy\u2019 and praising her willingness to criticize Israel,\u201d the Times wrote. \u201cIn April, the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, took credit for Ms. Gabbard\u2019s qualification for the first two Democratic primary debates.\u201d Gabbard addressed such smears as \u201ccompletely despicable\u201d during the Democrat presidential primary debate on Tuesday in Ohio.",

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " The department determined that those 38 people were \u201cculpable\u201d in 91 cases of sending classified information in messages that ended up in Clinton\u2019s personal email. The 38 are current and former State Department officials but were not identified in the report that was sent to Congress this week. The investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public. The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified, but could not assign fault in 497 cases. The development follows reports that the State Department had widened its inquiry into Clinton\u2019s private email server usage, with investigators questioning numerous aides of the Obama-era official in the past month. Some former Obama administration officials have attempted to discredit the investigation by accusing the Trump administration of targeting them. However, one current official retorted that \u201cthe process is set up in a manner to completely avoid any appearance of political bias.\u201d \u201cThis has nothing to do with who is in the White House,\u201d another official\u00a0affirmed\u00a0to the Washington Post. \u201cThis is about the time it took to go through millions of emails, which is about three and a half years.\u201d A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) review of Clinton\u2019s server found over 100 emails contained classified information, including 65 emails deemed \u201cSecret\u201d and 22 considered \u201cTop Secret.\u201d In addition, 2,093 emails, which were not labeled classified, were retroactively classified by the State Department. Several experts have argued Clinton broke multiple laws, including\u00a018 U.S. Code \u00a7 1924, which forbids \u201cunauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material.\u201d Yet, the FBI ruled in July 2016 that Clinton did not commit any crimes, despite characterizing her private email usage as \u201creckless.\u201d Then-FBI Director James Comey\u00a0infamously drafted a statement exonerating Clinton prior to the investigation\u2019s completion. Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz issued a stinging rebuke of the FBI\u2019s handling of the investigation in June 2018, writing that Comey\u2019s conduct during the probe as \u201cinsubordinate.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

She did not mention Clinton. But on Friday, Gabbard let loose:    Gabbard, who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the 2016 presidential election, resigned a leadership post in the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in protest at its favoritism toward Clinton. The left has long resented Clinton for voting to authorize the Iraq War. She also took credit for the war in Libya \u2014 a war that had disastrous results, as it allowed terrorist groups to take root across northern Africa. Clinton was widely blamed by conservatives for lax security around the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which was attacked on Sep. 11, 2012. The Obama administration originally characterized the attack as a protest against an anti-Islamic video posted by an obscure American filmmaker on YouTube. Hillary Clinton has continued to blame Russia for her loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. She also criticized the Obama administration \u2014 after leaving it \u2014 for not intervening in Syria sooner. Gabbard is a critic of U.S. involvement in Syria. Joel B.

Tulsi Gabbard is being \u201cgroomed\u201d by Russians to act as a spoiler in the 2020 race may have had the opposite effect of what the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee intended: It\u2019s elevated Gabbard\u2019s candidacy and may have inspired even more ardent interest in her campaign among Clinton critics.",
      "author": "Breitbart News",
      "content": " On Saturday, Gabbard found fans among the many Clinton skeptics across Iowa, where Clinton barely won the 2016 Democratic caucuses against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \u201cWhat is this horrible thing that Hillary said about you?\u201d one person asked Gabbard at a house party in West Branch. Gabbard responded that \u201cit revealed the truth that I have been experiencing for a long time now \u2014 which is that, because I have been trying to bring about an end to our country\u2019s long-held foreign policy of waging one regime-change war after the next. I am labeled as a traitor.\u201d \u201cThis is a message that is being sent to every single American. who speaks out for peace,\u201d she said. Gabbard\u2019s longshot campaign came under scrutiny this past week after Clinton appeared on a podcast where she did not mention the Hawaii congresswoman by name, but said she believes the Russians have \u201cgot their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third party candidate.\u201d There was no mistaking whom she meant. Although Russian interest in Gabbard is apparent, Clinton produced no evidence that Moscow is grooming or directly backing the congresswoman. Gabbard\u2019s campaign has been promoted by Russian state-owned media and a number of alt-right websites and defended on Twitter by the Russian Embassy. She\u2019s previously faced controversy and criticism from leaders in her party for her unorthodox foreign policy positions, like her decision to meet Syrian President Bashar Assad. On Friday and Saturday, Gabbard refused to disavow the support she\u2019s seen from Russian actors and alt-right sites. But she repeatedly said she will not run as an independent or third-party candidate if she doesn\u2019t win the Democratic nomination. And Gabbard encountered supporters across eastern Iowa on Saturday. During a campaign stop in Iowa City at a University of Iowa tailgate, a man came up to give Gabbard an ushanka-style yellow Hawkeye hat. \u201cIt\u2019s a Russian hat!\u201d Gabbard said with a laugh, before hugging the man and taking a picture with him. And at the West Branch house party, Gabbard found many Clinton critics who were supportive of her campaign. Clinton\u2019s comments were \u201cdivisive and despicable,\u201d said Patricia McIntosh, 83, a semi-retired university employee who liked Gabbard\u2019s \u201canti-regime-change message.\u201d McIntosh said: \u201cI have no respect for Hillary Clinton at all.\u201d Robert Rodriguez, a 35-year-old food delivery driver, drove from Minneapolis to see Gabbard speak. He, too, appreciated Gabbard\u2019s anti-war stance and said Clinton had \u201csowed division in this primary\u201d with her critique. He also noted Gabbard\u2019s support from some alt-right websites He asked: \u201cYou have people praising candidates for being able to reach across the aisle and garner support from the so-called other side, but Tulsi\u2019s a problem because she has support from the other side? Isn\u2019t that what we want?\u201d Both Rodriguez and McIntosh described themselves as longtime Gabbard fans and skeptics of the Democratic establishment, and both said they weren\u2019t sure if they\u2019d support the eventual nominee if neither Gabbard nor Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, another anti-establishment candidate for president, didn\u2019t win. But Gabbard also managed to win over some people who hadn\u2019t been familiar with her campaign, like Jennifer Rogers, a 38-year-old nurse from North Liberty, Iowa, who liked that Gabbard was a military veteran. \u201cI really like that she answers questions,\u201d she said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t just shout talking points and campaign slogans.\u201d Rogers said she\u2019s been on the fence but \u201ctoday I\u2019m pretty convinced that I think she\u2019s going to be my candidate.\u201d Still, it\u2019s unclear exactly what Gabbard hopes to achieve with her unorthodox campaign, as she\u2019s struggled to raise money and hit the polling threshold to make it on the debate stage. She has yet to qualify for next month\u2019s debate. Gabbard has just three staff members on the ground in Iowa. Asked whether she plans to add staff in any of the early states, Gabbard demurred. She said she\u2019s \u201ccontinuing to use every platform possible to reach voters directly\u201d when asked about her path to the nomination, and wouldn\u2019t predict how she\u2019d finish in Iowa. But she suggested that might not matter \u2014 even if she doesn\u2019t have enough delegates to win, \u201cwe\u2019re taking this all the way to the nomination.\u201d",

      "author": "Nancy Kaufman",
      "content": " Then, on Friday, Hillary Clinton herself kept the smear campaign going, saying in a podcast hosted by Barack Obama\u2019s former campaign manager David Plouffe that Russia is grooming Gabbard to be a third party candidate. \u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians.\u201d Gabbard lashed back at the Democratic Party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee, tweeting\u00a0in response,\u00a0\u201cThank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.\u201d Days before Gabbard appeared on the debate stage in Ohio, she had threatened to boycott the event, because she believes the DNC is rigged against outsider candidates such as herself. She declared that the Democratic National Committee and the \u201ccorporate media\u201d were\u00a0\u201ctrying to hijack the entire election process.\u201d Among other reasons, Gabbard argued that the polls the DNC chose for certifying the candidates for the November debate were not as accurate as many of the non-certified polls that could actually help her qualify. So far, the only candidates who have qualified for November are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. But the media smears, and the evident bias of the debate hosts, were the driving force. Two days after Gabbard\u2019s threat, the New York Times published what she called \u201c a greatest hits smear piece.\u201d Gabbard later noted: \u201cThese are the folks who will be acting as the neutral questioners/moderators of Tuesday\u2019s debate lol!\u201d At the debate itself, Gabbard took aim at the hosts: \u201cJust two days ago the New York Times put out an article saying that I\u2019m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I\u2019m an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.\u201d It was actually very kind of Gabbard to not mention the name attached to the CNN smear. Bakari Sellers said hours before the event that he firmly believed that Tulsi is a \u2018puppet for the Russian government.\u201d The fact is that Gabbard, a reservist in the U.S. Army National Guard who took time off her campaign to drill with her unit this summer, is more cautious about the use of military force than other candidates. For that, she is being attacked as a traitor. But it is a stance that has appeal to members of both parties who are weary of interventionist foreign policies. Another political outsider, former Rep.\u00a0Ron Paul (R-TX), is a Tulsi Gabbard fan. \u00a0Paul praised Gabbard when he said, \u201cShe\u2019s the most intelligent and would be the best. \u201c He also said, \u201cIf we had to pick one of them [Democrats] to be our president I think she would be giving us the best chance as for bringing about peace.\u201d Gabbard is a proud veteran who founded and is the co-chair of the Congressional Post 9/11 Veteran Caucus, which demonstrates her continual work in defending the work her military brothers and sisters continue to do to fight for their country. At the debate, when Gabbard calmly asked if she could ask Warren a question, she was cut off. Silenced by the very media who smeared her, as if to protect Warren. Yet Gabbard, as after the second debate, was the most googled candidate after the candidates left the stage. Apparently American\u00a0want to hear more from Tulsi despite the smears. The Times called Gabbard\u2019s supporters \u201cunusual Americans\u201d; that has now become a rallying cry. These \u201cUnusual Amerians\u201d include the \u201dunconventional mix of anti-interventionist progressives, libertarians, [and] contrarian culture-war skeptics\u2026\u201d that the Times\u00a0mocked as Gabbard\u2019s base by associating them with extremists. Gabbard delivered a powerful response in her closing statement at the debate: \u201cI don\u2019t see deplorables. I see fellow Americans worthy of respect even when we disagree strongly.\u201d Gabbard\u2019s use of the word \u201cdeplorables\u201d was a clear allusion Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d a phrase that the former secretary of state used to tarnish her opponent\u2019s supporters back in 2016. It came back to haunt Clinton \u2014 as will her declaration that Gabbard is Russia\u2019s favorite. Gabbard, unlike Clinton and many of the presidential hopefuls in 2020, has sacrificed for her country through her military service in a combat zone, and understands the cost of war from first-hand experience. That is the simple secret of her appeal. It is amazing how far the corporate media and the party establishment will go in their attempt to stop that message from breaking through. Nancy Kaufman is a reporter for Los Angeles-area progressive radio station KPFK and taught high school English in the LAUSD for 20 years. She is a registered Democrat who is opposed to interventionist wars for the purpose of regime change.",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " In a video released Sunday on Twitter, Gabbard talks about the origins of her long-simmering feud with Democratic leaders, dating back to her support for the insurgent campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in 2016. Gabbard resigned from her post within the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in protest at the way then-chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) was treating Sanders. Her concerns were later vindicated by Wikileaks, which released emails showing that party leaders had conspired to help Clinton secure the nomination, forcing Schultz to resign. In Sunday\u2019s video, Gabbard recalls: \u201cPeople warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my \u2018political career.\u2019 They said, \u2018Clinton will never forget,\u2019 that \u2018she and her rich and powerful friends, her allies in politics and the media, will make sure that you are destroyed.'\u201d  Gibbered then refers to the \u201ccountless hit pieces\u201d against her in the mainstream media, the most recent of which was an Oct. 11 article in the\u00a0New York Times painting Gabbard as a right-wing extremist. (The\u00a0Times hosted the fourth primary debate just three days later, and the article \u2014 which lacked any evidence \u2014 was seen by some as an effort to marginalize Gabbard after she had attacked Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) effectively in the second debate.) Citing her 16 years of military service in the U.S. Army National Guard, and her congressional service on national security committees, Gabbard rebukes Clinton and others for \u201cfalsely portray[ing] me as a traitor.\u201d Clinton claimed in a podcast hosted by former Barack Obama 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe last week that Gabbard was a \u201cRussian asset\u201d likely to run as a third-party candidate. She cited no evidence to back up her claim \u2014 which Gabbard promptly rejected, calling Clinton the \u201cqueen of the warmongers\u201d and blaming her for a string of media smears. In her video, Gabbard goes on to say that the message of the party establishment is that \u201cif you stand up against Hillary and the party power brokers, if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.\u201d \u201cThey will not intimidate us,\u201d she declares. \u201cThe will not silence us.\u201d Gabbard goes on to say that not only is she running against corruption, but against the Democratic Party elite. \u201cI\u2019m running for president to bring about a New Democratic Party, a new leadership that will fight for peace, fight for the people, and protect our planet.\u201d Separately the Gabbard campaign sent fundraising emails over the weekend capitalizing on the confrontation with Hillary Clinton. The email from Gabbard read, in part (original emphasis): Hillary Clinton \u2014 the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long \u2014 finally came out from behind the curtain yesterday, accusing me of being a Russian asset, asserting I was being \u201cgroomed\u201d by Russian interests. If this a fight she wants to have, one that has implications for all of us and the future of our democracy, then I challenge her to come out from behind her proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media, and face me directly. Gabbard has struggled to escape the second tier of presidential candidates, and failed to qualify for the third debate in September. However, she has made an impact in each debate appearance, partly because of her strong anti-war stance, and partly because of her willingness to attack other candidates\u2019 positions \u2014 something few others have been bold enough to do until recently. Though she supported Sanders in 2016, Gabbard has more moderate positions on several issues. She does not believe in decriminalizing illegal border crossings, for example, and would restrict many abortions in the third trimester \u2014 a position widely shared by the American public but which few of her rivals would dare to take. She has come under fire in recent years for her opposition to U.S. military involvement in Syria \u2014 a position she has pursued, in part, through a controversial visit to Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in 2017. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi made a similar visit in 2007. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), a 2020 Democrat presidential candidate and Hawaii Army National Guard major, and suggested she was a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d She made the claim on \u201cCampaign HQ,\u201d a podcast that is hosted by former President Barack Obama\u2019s aide David Plouffe. Clinton said of Gabbard: I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she\u2019s also a Russian asset. Yeah, she\u2019s a Russian asset. On Sunday, she tweeted a fake letter dated October 16, 1962, from John F. Kennedy to Nikita\u00a0Khrushchev\u00a0that was supposed to emulate one recently written by Trump to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. She tweeted, \u201cFound in the archives\u2026\u201d  Her use of the word \u201carchives\u201d prompted some online to bring up her 30,000 deleted emails from her own email archives:  It also prompted mocking from journalists:  Conservative show host Dan Bongino said Clinton was \u201cbreathlessly spouting ridiculous conspiracy theories\u201d: Trump broke Hillary. She\u2019s a shell of a human being now, breathlessly spouting ridiculous conspiracy theories to the few friends she has left. She is an awful, horrible person, as those who had the unfortunate experience of working with her know.  A New York Times\u00a0piece called Clinton a \u201cmaster troll\u201d who is \u201cliving her best life,\u201d which also prompted some mocking:  And not all of Clinton\u2019s former 2016 supporters are not amused by her recent activities. Her fake letter tweet prompted an expletive-laced argument between two of them over whether she should get out of the spotlight.  Times\u00a0political reporter Lisa Lerer noted Clinton\u2019s increasing political activity over the last two weeks and raised the prospect of her joining the 2020 presidential race. Lerer wrote: Mrs. Clinton\u2019s return to the spotlight comes as a number of Democratic Party officials \u2014 including some major donors, activists and black pastors in early voting states \u2014 are privately wondering whether she should jump into the primary race. Clinton is promoting a new book with her daughter Chelsea, but she has also appeared at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in recent days, according to reports.

Clinton commented on impeachment during a book promotion event at Portland\u2019s Revolution Hall with author Cheryl Strayed in Oregon. \u201cI just feel so strongly that what\u2019s going on with the impeachment inquiry was not a choice, it was an obligation,\u201d she said, referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to move forward on impeachment. Clinton indicated she believed it was a real possibility that Republicans in Congress who might turn on Trump during the impeachment inquiry, forcing him out of office. \u201cA lot of them have announced that they are not going to run for re-election,\u201d Clinton said, referring to Republican members of Congress who might feel more responsibility to oppose the president. She said it was still unclear who was the Democrat candidate best prepared to face Trump in the 2020 election. \u201cAll that matters is that we win,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate to be so, you know, simplistic about it.\u201d When some in the audience shouted that she should run for president, she laughed and said \u201cthank you!\u201d but did not rule out another run. Clinton warned all of the candidates to prepare for an onslaught of negative attention. \u201cWe have to vet them because believe me, they make up stuff about you and you got to be in a position where the public and the press don\u2019t fall for that again,\u201d she warned. She did not specifically mention former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, but it was significantly challenged after President Trump raised questions about Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden\u2019s corrupt dealings in China and Ukraine. Any Democrat presidential candidate, she said, had to withstand the \u201cbrutal attacks\u201d from \u201cthe right, and the Russians, and all their allies.\u201d Clinton conceded that any candidate had to be able to win the electoral college, not just the popular vote as she did. \u201cAt the end of the day, as I know better than anybody and as Al Gore knows, that is not the game, you gotta win the electoral vote,\u201d she said.",

Rothman, a New Jersey Democrat, complained of a \u201cRepublican juggernaut, driven by the right wing.\u201d Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island, a nephew of the late President John F. Kennedy, spoke of \u201ca political lynching,\u201d and Representative Danny K. Davis, an Illinois Democrat, denounced what he described as \u201ca lynching.\u201d \u2022 Brianna Keilar interviewed Never Trumper and former congressman from Connecticut Chris Shays on Aug. 11, 2016, on CNN: Brianna Keilar: Another Republican breaking with his party to support Hillary Clinton. We\u2019re talking about former congressman Chris Shays, who wrote on Op-Ed for cnn.com about his decision, saying in part, \u201cI know some Republicans dislike President Obama and have such a strong dislike for Hillary Clinton. They are willing to vote for a man they know does not have the temperament, knowledge, or experience to be president. In fact, I think many Republicans know Donald Trump could cause great damage to our country and the world at large and still plan to vote for him. But not me.\u201d Former Connecticut congressman Chris Shays joining us now. And tell us about your decision. How did you come to this conclusion that you were not going to \u2014 not only are you not going to support Donald Trump, but you are going to support Hillary Clinton. Shays: Well, first off, I was a strong and am a strong supporter of John Kasich. He was my first choice, my second choice, my third choice, but now my conclusion is that Hillary Clinton is my choice. If you had told me I would have said that three months ago, I would have been really surprised. So I watched the conventions. Republicans had a very dark convention. It was almost like a lynching, you know \u2014 guilty and lock her up. And I thought this isn\u2019t the party of Ronald Reagan and it ain\u2019t the party that I joined. https://twitter.com/CNNOpinion/status/657658275958255617?s=20 \u2022 MSNBC interviewed Hillary Clinton on March 14, 2016: Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump is \u201cinciting mob violence\u201d that recalls lynch mobs Monday evening at an MSNBC townhall, where she also took tough questions on foreign policy and trade. Clinton told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews, who moderated the event in Springfield, Illinois, that she holds Trump responsible for the violence seen in recent days at his rallies, and believes his rhetoric is not only wrong and offensive, but also \u201cdangerous.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s been building this incitement,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are inciting mob violence, which is what Trump is doing,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of memories that people have. They\u2019re in the DNA. People remember mob violence that lead to lynching, people remember mob violence that lead to people being shot, being grabbed, being mistreated. And it\u2019s something that has a deep, almost psychological resonance to people who have ever been in any position of feeling somewhat fearful, somewhat worried.\u201d https://twitter.com/SteveGuest/status/1186714766896717831 \u2022 Dan Rodricks wrote a commentary about Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment on December 16, 1998, in the Baltimore Sun: So Clinton stepped into a trap set by those who\u2019ve been out to get him. And, knowing this \u2013 because he\u2019s a Rhodes scholar, after all \u2013 he still didn\u2019t tell the whole truth. He gave his enemies the hanging rope. (I think he should have told Jones\u2019 lawyers, and later Starr, that the question of his relationships with women-not-his-wife was none of their business. Or he should have told the truth.) So here we are, my fellow Americans. Clinton lied under oath, and that warrants impeachment. Right? Some say no. A lie stemming from a private matter doesn\u2019t matter. A lie in such a situation is understandable; most any man or woman would have done the same. Impeachment for such a minor offense would hurt the country more than Clinton\u2019s lies ever did. Besides, this whole thing looks like a political lynching, an attempt to overturn two elections. \u2022 The Washington Post published this on October 31, 2016, about former FBI director James Comey: Trump\u2019s entire campaign boiled down to one argument, summed up in his ever-elegant designation of his opponent as \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d That was all he had. At his political rallies, even at the Republican National Convention, he encouraged his devoted throng to shout \u201cLock her up!\u201d While many Republicans no doubt believed she had to be guilty of something (with the same confidence that many Democrats believed George W. Bush lied the nation into war in Iraq), they also needed her to be found guilty. With a sure loser as their nominee, it was their only hope. Republicans had become a lynch mob, demanding frontier justice, and they howled in outrage when Comey refused to participate in the hanging, accusing him of unfairly rigging the election when all he had done was his job. \u2022 CBS wrote about the \u201cGOP Lynch mob\u201d on April 6, 2011: GOP lynch mob is still trying to string up the fledgling Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Members of the House Financial Services Committee met today to discuss four bills, all sponsored by Republicans and backed by the banking industry, aimed at subduing the agency even before it officially launches this summer. \u2022 The New York Times wrote about Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment on September 18, 1998: A \u201dlarge volume of calls\u201d to Senator John Glenn, a Democrat who said this week that it would be \u201dreckless and injudicious\u201d for him to join \u201dthe rush to judgment\u201d in the Lewinsky matter, have run 2 to 1 in favor of resignation or impeachment. Mr. Chabot\u2019s office said the tally there was 425 to 15 against Mr. Clinton since Kenneth W. Starr issued his report a week ago. Not that the President lacks vocal supporters in this state.

      "content": " The Associated Press (AP)\u00a0published a feature on Clinton entitled \u201cDemocrats\u2019 2020 race has a new shadow: Hillary Clinton,\u201d that points out she is different than others who have lost a presidential election: Sitting senators like Democrat John Kerry and Republican John McCain returned quietly to Capitol Hill. Democrat Al Gore became a leading advocate for climate action. McCain\u2019s running mate, Sarah Palin, has made perhaps the biggest recent splash as a conservative media sensation who helped stoke a base that ultimately embraced Trump. A former aide to Clinton in 2016 went as far as to say many people think she deserves to be on the national stage. \u201cThere are people who believe she won \u2014 or should have won,\u201d Karen Finney said in the AP article. Finney said Clinton \u201cis in her own category\u201d and a \u201cglobal figure.\u201d But some people aren\u2019t as thrilled with Clinton\u2019s meddling in the 2020 election, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who didn\u2019t get the Democrat nomination in 2016 but hopes to this election cycle. Sanders shamed Clinton on her recent remarks about Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) being a Russian favorite.  \u201cTulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,\u201d Sanders tweeted on Monday. \u201cPeople can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.\u201d \u201cGabbard retorted by calling Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers \u2026 and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long,\u201d AP reported. Larry Cohen, who is a Sanders supporter, praised and then warned Clinton in the AP report. Hillary \u201cput a lifetime into the Democratic Party. She deserves to be heard,\u201d said Cohen, who is also on the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIn this senior leader role she has \u2026 it\u2019s her job to embrace the range of politics within the party and not polarize within it.\u201d AP reported: Her scuffle with Gabbard and other recent headlines she\u2019s driven demonstrate that the 71-year-old remains a political lightning rod, just as she\u2019s been through much of the last three decades.\u00a0 The dynamics raise questions about how Clinton and her party can best leverage her strengths and navigate her weaknesses through next November. Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, defended his boss in the AP report. \u201cThe short of it is that she\u2019s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but it\u2019s as simple as that. She\u2019s out there telling the truth.\u201d \u201cFinney predicts Clinton \u2018will be out on the trail in 2020,\u2019 if not for the nominee, then for \u2018any of the record number of women who will be running\u2019 for other offices,\u201d AP reported.

Merrill continued: I too am tired of talking about this, but let\u2019s again set the record straight. HRC speculated that the only way the GOP is going to win in states where Trump can\u2019t hit a 50% majority is to 1) Suppress the vote, as they do widely and routinely, & 2) Bank on the 3rd party spoiler. \u201cAnd yes, she said that certain fringe members of the Democratic and Green parties are assets to the Russians,\u201d he continued. \u201cWell guess what folks? That\u2019s true. She didn\u2019t call anyone a spy, as some are wrongly asserting for their own political gain\u201d:   Merrill\u2019s attempt to soften Clinton\u2019s position did not alter the failed Trump challenger\u2019s sentiment. While Clinton did not explicitly state that the \u201cRussians\u201d are grooming Gabbard, she openly expressed her belief that Gabbard is a \u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d and implied during the interview that she is a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d \u201cShe is a favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.

Gabbard issued a strong response, calling Clinton\u00a0\u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long\u201d:   When asked if Clinton was, in fact, referring to Gabbard in that interview, Clinton spokesman Merrill told NBC News, \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d Clinton\u2019s attack of Gabbard prompted a response from the president, who said, \u201cI don\u2019t know Tulsi, but she\u2019s not a Russian agent.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s the one that\u2019s accusing everybody of being a Russian agent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent, so that\u2019s a scam that was pretty much put down.\u201d",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The New York Times on Tuesday ran a piece centering around concerns of establishment Democrats, who are not confident that anyone in the current Democrat field \u2014 not Joe Biden (D), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \u2014 could successfully take down President Trump in the 2020 general election. \u201cSince the last debate, just anecdotally, I\u2019ve had five or six people ask me: \u2018Is there anybody else?\u2019\u201d Leah Daughtry, who the Times described as a \u201clongtime Democrat who has run two of the party\u2019s recent conventions,\u201d said. That is just one example of many. According to the Times, many Democrats \u2014 from voters to high-profile lawmakers \u2014 are worried about the state of the current Democrat field and are quietly looking for a savior: \u201cThere\u2019s more anxiety than ever,\u201d said Connie Schultz, a journalist who is married to Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another Democrat who some in the party would like to see join the race. \u201cWe\u2019re both getting the calls. I\u2019ve been surprised by some who\u2019ve called me.\u201d \u201cI can see it, I can feel it, I can hear it,\u201d Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor, said of the unease within the party. He said he thinks Mr. Biden is best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump but called the former vice president\u2019s fund-raising \u201ca real concern.\u201d Clinton and billionaire Michael Bloomberg are reportedly keeping tabs on the mounting concerns and \u201chave both told people privately in recent weeks that if they thought they could win, they would consider entering the primary,\u201d according to the Times. However, they are \u201cskeptical there would be an opening, according to Democrats who have spoken with them.\u201d The Times adds that Democrats familiar with their thinking do not see either jumping in unless Biden goes down: The chances that another major contender decides to run are remote: While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both been encouraged to enter the race, Democrats close to them believe the only scenario under which they\u2019d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened. The Washington Post also signaled\u00a0that a 2020 run for Clinton remains on the table, as Democrats continue to worry about Biden\u2019s mounting baggage and the ultra-liberal policies of his closest contenders. \u201cHillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction,\u201d the Post reported: Those close to Clinton, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on her behalf, say she has felt vindicated over the past few weeks as Trump\u2019s political difficulties have deepened. That sentiment was reinforced this week when the State Department announced its probe into emails sent to a private server, a major complication of her 2016 campaign, found no evidence of deliberate mishandling of classified information by department employees. One source who spoke with Clinton said that it is \u201cunlikely\u201d that she would throw her hat into the presidential ring for the third time but emphasized that the chances \u201cain\u2019t zero.\u201d \u201cBut put it this way: It ain\u2019t zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely,\u201d the source said, according to the Post. Clinton has made no obvious attempts to extinguish the festering 2020 buzz. This month, Trump teased \u201cCrooked Hillary,\u201d suggesting that she enter the race \u201cto try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.\u201d Clinton warned Trump not to \u201ctempt\u201d her to do so on social media.  She furthered speculation during an interview with PBS NewsHour, claiming that she could \u201cobviously\u201d beat Trump \u201cagain,\u201d although her use of \u201cagain\u201d remains unclear, as Trump defeated Clinton by surpassing the required 270 Electoral College threshold. \u201cMaybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut, just seriously, I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\u201d The former secretary of state continued to fuel the rumblings by posting a quote from Beyonc\u00e9 about the need to \u201ctake\u201d power on Tuesday. \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 speaks the truth,\u201d Clinton wrote in the caption:",

      "author": "Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)",
      "content": " We give you this aid \u2014 on the expectation that you will not steal any of it for personal use, that you will spend it as we instruct, and on the understanding that if you don\u2019t spend the money as we command, you won\u2019t get any more next year. Democrats want people to be alarmed by a Latin phrase, but, really, making foreign aid contingent on behavior is actually the defining reason that countries supposedly give aid \u2014 to influence the behavior of the receiving country. For example, for our military aid, we demand that it be spent buying from the American military-industrial complex. Foreign countries are legally bound to use the money we give them to buy armaments from American manufacturers. Likewise, we often demand government reforms and an end to corruption. Sometimes we have demanded specific actions, such as when former Vice President Joe Biden demanded the prosecutor looking into his son\u2019s company be fired. So, really, \u201cquid pro quo\u201d seems to be the norm rather than the exception. The Ex-Im Bank loans money to foreign entities \u2014 the quid \u2014 and demands that the foreigners buy American-made goods \u2014 the quo. But Democrats opine that Trump made foreign aid (welfare) contingent on investigating a potential rival, which makes the whole quid pro quo exchange somehow an impeachable offense. But I\u2019ve yet to hear Democrats complain about the money (quid) that Hillary Clinton paid foreign spy Christopher Steele to get dirt (the quo) on her political opponent \u2014 Donald Trump. Do Democrats really believe they can sweep the quid pro quo of Hillary Clinton and Christopher Steele under the rug and ignore it? The Senate should immediately commence public hearings that parallel the House hearings. The Senate hearings should investigate the quid pro quo of Hillary Clinton transferring money to a foreign spy in exchange for the Steele dossier. Hillary Clinton should be compelled to answer under oath: was there a quid pro quo? Former CIA head and current Trump-hater John Brennan should be summoned and asked: \u201cDid you contact any foreign spy agencies or agents (active or retired) to investigate then-candidate Donald Trump?\u201d Was there a quid pro quo? Former FBI head and current Trump-hater James Comey should be summoned and asked: \u201cDid the FBI exchange money with a foreign spy to collect information on candidate Donald Trump?\u201d\u00a0Was there a quid pro quo? If Democrats want the American people to believe Donald Trump did something wrong in asking Ukraine to investigate the $50,000 a month that Hunter Biden was receiving, they will first have to admit that their fearless leader Hillary Clinton actually did much worse by paying a foreign spy, Christopher Steele, money for dirt on Trump. To convince the American public that their impeachment inquiry is anything other than empty partisanship, the Democrats will also have to admit that the Obama administration ginned up and purposefully spread the now-discredited Steele dossier. Democrats will further have to admit that Robert Mueller\u2019s $35 million investigation found the Steele dossier to be pure fiction. When the Democrats admit that they have committed \u201cquid pro quo\u201d a dozen times in trying to entrap President Trump, then, and only then, will American voters consider their impeachment inquiry anything other than a witch hunt.

That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset,\u201d Clinton stated during a podcast interview with David Plouffe,\u00a0President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager. \u201cThey [Republicans] know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it,\u201d she added. Gabbard responded with force, calling Clinton the \u201cqueen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d",

And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely,\u201d a source said, according to the\u00a0Post. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is reportedly conducting himself the same way, telling those close to him that he would consider jumping in the race if Biden falters. \u201cBloomberg is in if Biden is out,\u201d a \u201cNew York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,\u201d told CNBC. While the Times adds that the chances of either jumping in the race are \u201cremote,\u201d it indicates that Democrats close to the potential candidates \u201cbelieve the only scenario under which they\u2019d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened.\u201d A\u00a0McLaughlin & Associates October 2019 poll released this week examined that scenario, taking Biden out of the equation and putting both Clinton and Bloomberg in the race. While Bloomberg\u2019s presence does not appear to make a significant impact, Biden\u2019s absence and Clinton\u2019s addition would cause Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to rise to the top of the national field with 23 percent support. Under the scenario, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) would maintain her top tier status with 20 percent support, followed by Clinton with ten percent support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) would also gain a notable boost, coming right behind Clinton with nine percent support. Andrew Yang (D) would also enjoy a bump, jumping to six percent, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with five percent support, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with four percent support, and Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) with three percent support. The remaining candidates would garner two percent support or less. That includes Bloomberg, who would only see one percent support:  However, the poll found Biden leading the race as is with 28 percent support, followed by Sanders with 18 percent support and Warren with 16 percent:  The McLaughlin & Associates National Survey was taken October 17-22 among 1,000 likely voters and has a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percent.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Gabbard, who has been in the thick of a contentious back and forth with the former Trump challenger, ripped Clinton in a scathing op-ed, harkening back to the former secretary of state\u2019s \u201cforeign-policy catastrophes\u201d and citing them as a \u201cprimary\u201d reason for her resignation as vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Gabbard, as she has alluded before, said Clinton and her allies have never forgiven her for backing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in 2016, adding, \u201cthe smears have been nonstop ever since.\u201d \u201cHardly a week goes by when I\u2019m not asked a question about how I\u2019m being secretly backed by Russia or other foreign powers\u2014on top of countless other falsehoods intended to destroy my reputation,\u201d Gabbard wrote, asserting that \u201cthose who are indebted to the war machine and the overreaching intelligence agencies, as well as their cheerleaders in the media\u201d are hellbent on taking her down because \u201cthey know they can\u2019t control me.\u201d She continued: This isn\u2019t a petty \u201cspat\u201d between Mrs. Clinton and me. It\u2019s a serious contrast in views about the choice voters face as they decide which Democratic candidate is best equipped to defeat President Trump. Mrs. Clinton already lost to Mr. Trump once. Why would Democrats think a Hillary 2.0 candidate would result in anything different? Whether Mrs. Clinton\u2019s name is on the ballot or not, her foreign policy will be, as many of the Democratic candidates adhere to her doctrine of acting as the world\u2019s police, using the tools of war to overthrow governments we don\u2019t like, wasting taxpayer dollars, costing American lives, causing suffering and destruction abroad, and undermining America\u2019s security. Gabbard, while stressing that she is not an isolationist, said her administration would work to contrast Clinton\u2019s foreign policy failures and stop the U.S. role as the world\u2019s police. \u201cI will lead with a robust, positive foreign policy based on diplomacy and cooperation rather than confrontation and conflict,\u201d Gabbard wrote. \u201cThose who follow the Bush-Clinton doctrine believe the only way to interact with other nations is by bombing them or starving them with draconian sanctions,\u201d she continued, referencing her status as a veteran and experience on the\u00a0Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees. \u201cOnly when we recognize the failings of the past\u2014embodied by Mrs. Clinton and her minions in the media\u2014can we move forward to a future of peace, dignity, transparency and aloha,\u201d Gabbard concluded. Clinton sparked the recent war of words with Gabbard after describing the presidential hopeful as a\u00a0\u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d and implying that Gabbard is a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d \u201cShe is a favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset,\u201d Clinton stated during a podcast interview with former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager\u00a0David Plouffe. \u201cThey [Republicans] know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it,\u201d Clinton added. Gabbard responded, calling Clinton the \u201cqueen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d She announced last week that she will not seek re-election in order to focus entirely on her presidential bid.

Failed Senate candidate Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke desperately tries to breathe life into his flailing mess of a presidential campaign by vowing to send armed government agents door to door rounding up the guns of law-abiding innocent citizens. Turns out, that doesn\u2019t matter either. Twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton knew Rep. Elijah Cummings personally, yet still chose to exploit his funeral as an opportunity to score political points on national television last week. In an utterly classless \u201ceulogy,\u201d Mrs. Clinton made a barely veiled reference to President Trump as the wicked King Ahab from the Bible. \u201cLike that Old Testament prophet, [Rep. Cummings] stood against corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel and looked out for the vulnerable among us. He lifted up the next generation of leaders. He even worked a few miracles. And he kept reminding us life is no dress rehearsal. The American people want to live their lives without fear of their leaders.\u201d Not sure who Queen Jezebel is in this strange passage. But nobody had any doubts about who King Ahab was. Her bitterness runs fathoms deep. Perhaps no display of political exploitation was more disgusting than the reaction of House Democrats to the thrilling news that ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi blew himself up after U.S. special operations forces cornered him in Syria. This is a heinous butcher who raped women and girls, ripped out fingernails, burned people alive and preached beheadings for nonbelievers. His final act before plunging into the fiery pits of hell was to murder three of his own children. The reaction of top Democrats in Congress? Outrage over the fact that President Trump had not told them about the raid beforehand. Mr. Trump, understandably, explained that the mission was simply too sensitive to risk looping in hopelessly partisan Democrats in Congress who might then go blabbing about the raid and endanger the lives of U.S. troops. Proving Mr. Trump\u2019s point exactly, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi specifically complained that Mr. Trump notified Russian officials. Get it? Because it sounds like more Russia \u201ccollusion.\u201d With every passing day, these people become more and more impossible to take seriously. \u2022\u00a0Contact Charles Hurt at\u00a0churt@washingtontimes.com\u00a0or on Twitter @charleshurt.",

      "subtitle": "Lee Smith\u2019s book,\u00a0The Plot Against the President: The True Story of How Congressman Devin Nunes Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal in U.S. History, does more than recount the story of how Hillary Clinton was able to recruit federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to smear her rival \u2014 an effort that became an attempt to remove the president from office. It suggests the present \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d is the fruit of that poisoned tree.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Smith follows the efforts of former House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) as he discovered the truth about the outgoing Obama administration\u2019s efforts to \u201cunmask\u201d the names of Americans caught up in the government\u2019s foreign surveillance and leak them, illegally, to the media. Nunes and his \u201cObjective Medusa\u201d team found that the FBI had likely misled the FISA court to obtain warrants by hiding the partisan origins of evidence. Along the way, the mainstream media colluded with the FBI \u2014 and with Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm first hired through the Washington Free Beacon to dig up dirt on Trump during the Republican primary, and then paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (who laundered their payments through the Perkins Coie law firm). The media relied on Fusion GPS for \u201cscoops\u201d and helped the FBI plant its \u201cevidence.\u201d Some of the story will be familiar to those who have followed the story of the phony Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d theory over the past three-plus years. But Smith also breaks new ground. He argues, convincingly, that the so-called \u201cdossier\u201d compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele for Fusion GPS was actually a re-hash of earlier work \u2014 four \u201cproto-dossiers\u201d that were put together with the help of Nellie Ohr, wife of Department of Justice official Bruce Ohr. Smith fills in key gaps in the story, suggesting that the original motivation for the \u201cdossier\u201d was not necessarily to stop Donald Trump from winning the presidency \u2014 since few imagined he could, anyway \u2014 but to set Trump up as the fall guy in the event Clinton\u2019s missing emails were ever discovered and released. They wanted to make the story about how the emails were discovered, rather than how they were hidden and deleted by Clinton in the first place. Their efforts later roped the FBI into an attempt to stop Trump from being elected \u2014 and, once elected, to stop him from taking office; and, once in office, to have him removed. During a key period in May 2017, Smith argues, the senior levels of law enforcement in the United States held serious discussions about how to get rid of the president. Contrary to his denials, Smith writes, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was part of those deliberations. Special Counsel Robert Mueller was meant to deliver the goods \u2014 even though everyone involved knew that the goods were not there. Mueller and former FBI Director James Comey had hoped to entrap Trump in obstructing justice \u2014 a claim that Democrats are still hoping to use as part of the basis for impeachment. But Nunes and new Attorney General William Barr put a stop to the scheme \u2014 as did Mueller himself, in his bumbling testimony. In criminal law, there is a doctrine known as the \u201cfruit of the poisoned tree.\u201d Prosecutors are barred from bringing evidence that was obtained illegally or through violations of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. In this case, the Democrats\u2019 evidence \u2014 such as it is \u2014 of Trump\u2019s alleged obstruction of justice was obtained through a corrupt process. Crimes may also have been committed along the way, as U.S. Attorney John Durham may soon report. The Ukraine allegations are arguably the fruit of the same poisoned tree. They were manufactured by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who lied to the public about his contact with the so-called \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d who himself (or herself) may have violated rules by going straight to the House Intelligence Committee with complaints about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. Schiff\u2019s credibility, marred by years of lying about Russia \u201ccollusion,\u201d also taints the latest inquiry. Smith\u2019s book is a chilling read. It is well-written, with all the suspense of a suspense thriller \u2014 one that documents real-life events. By sheer coincidence, it is being released as Democrats launch their latest coup effort \u2014 one that recapitulates claims of collusion, this time with Russia\u2019s enemy. The story told in\u00a0The Plot Against the President justifies Trump\u2019s efforts to find out Ukraine\u2019s role in what happened \u2014 and ought to stop impeachment in its tracks. Joel B.

Katy Perry, left, holds the hand of Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, right, during a concert at the Mann Center for the Performing Arts, Saturday, Nov. 5, 2016, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) Court documents show\u00a0Backgrid, which owns the rights to the photo, is demanding that Perry cough up $150,000. \u201cDefendants used, and continue to use, the photograph without authorization or permission from Backgrid to do so even after being aware of the infringement,\u201d the suit reads. Of course, this isn\u2019t the first time Perry has found herself in legal hot water. In August, Katy Perry, her collaborators and her record label were ordered to pay more than $2.78 million because the pop star\u2019s 2013 hit \u201cDark Horse\u201d copied a 2009 Christian rap song, a federal jury decided Thursday. It was an underdog victory for rapper Marcus Gray, a relatively obscure artist once known as Flame, whose 5-year-old lawsuit survived constant court challenges and a trial against top-flight attorneys for Perry and the five other music-industry heavyweights who wrote her song. The amount fell well short of the nearly $20 million sought by attorneys for Gray and the two co-writers of \u201cJoyful Noise\u201d \u2014 Emanuel Lambert and Chike Ojukwu \u2014 but they said they were pleased. \u201cWe weren\u2019t here seeking to punish anyone,\u201d said Gray\u2019s attorney, Michael A. Kahn. \u201cOur clients came here seeking justice, and they feel they received justice from a jury of their peers.\u201d Perry herself was hit for just over $550,000, with Capitol Records responsible for the biggest part of the award \u2014 $1.2 million. Defense attorneys had argued for an overall award of about $360,000. Perry\u2019s attorney, Christine Lepera, said they plan to vigorously fight the decision. The AP contributed to this report.",

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " The book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us, hits bookstores stores Tuesday, and Trump, Jr., joined Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend ahead of its public release to discuss the book and the Democrat Party\u2019s radical turn. Trump, Jr., even launched a website TriggerALib.com where people can send copies of the book to top leftists like 2016 failed Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and even Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT). \u201cI have plenty of friends who are Democrats and I have plenty of friends who are from what would have been blue collar years ago Democrat rust belt America, and I just go to them because there\u2019s a strong history component to some of this,\u201d Trump, Jr., told Breitbart News. \u201cWe talk about this in Triggered as well. Their grandfather voted Democrat, their father voted Democrat, they\u2019re union families\u2014I just go listen, \u2018look at the platforms. Look at Donald Trump\u2019s platform versus today\u2019s modern Democrat platform.\u2019 The inmates are running the asylum over at the DNC. They\u2019re not standing for the American worker anymore. Their values are not your grandfather\u2019s Democrat Party values. JFK would be \u2018alt-right\u2019 today, he\u2019d be the worst human being in the world. When you start saying that to those guys that again have this\u2014it\u2019s more of a tradition than anything\u2014it\u2019s like whoa. That\u2019s when the lightbulb goes off: \u2018you\u2019re right.\u2019 This is not the Democrat Party that I knew. This is not the Democrat Party that I knew 10 to 15 years ago in college. I mean, it\u2019s gone nuts. It\u2019s being run by the craziest crazies, by the lunatic fringe of the party. There isn\u2019t a moderate Democrat anymore. Just look at the presidential contenders. I mean, they\u2019re putting forward socialist platforms and ideals. It\u2019s never-ending.\u201d Trump, Jr., said the \u201cage of outrage\u201d system in which the establishment media and left freak out about everything on Trump \u201conly flows one way\u201d: against Trump and his supporters. \u201cYou see that in the media response, you see that in the Democrat political response, it\u2019s just\u2014I think Triggered really captures the environment that we\u2019re in,\u201d Trump, Jr., outlined. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to see this around the country both from the campaign and when I speak on college campuses because we are willing to have that dialogue with everyone else. But it seems like the dialogue only goes one way. When we go somewhere, the people who show up to listen only show up to listen\u2014but the people who may have different views go there to sort of only disrupt and prevent you from delivering that message. I hear about all this tolerance supposedly from the left and they\u2019re preaching it day in and day out that they\u2019re very tolerant unless you don\u2019t agree with them fully. Then they are quite the opposite of tolerant. I can assure you there is nothing quite so intolerant as a leftist preaching tolerance every day.\u201d Trump, Jr., said there are examples of the media and leftist triggers \u201cevery day,\u201d and cited several recent examples like when the Washington Post fawned over ISIS terrorist leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi after a raid ordered by President Trump led to the world\u2019s most-wanted terrorist\u2019s death and when the media maligned Trump\u2019s entrance to the recent UFC fight at Madison Square Garden. \u201cYou see how triggered the mainstream media has become,\u201d Trump, Jr., said. \u201cThere\u2019s no secret that they were always left-leaning, but now they don\u2019t even pretend to be objective anymore. Last weekend when my father got the number one terrorist in the world\u2014the founder of ISIS\u2014you\u2019d think that they would rejoice. Instead, the Washington Post does an obituary almost mourning the loss of Al-Baghdadi calling him an \u2018Austere Religious Scholar\u2019 not a piece of garbage, rapist, murdering terrorist that by the way lit journalists on fire. That hate, their outrage really only goes one way. They\u2019ll do anything to try and sell that point to the point where they don\u2019t even tell the truth anymore. Heck, I was with my father last night at Madison Square Garden at the UFC fight and we walked out and Dana White said directly to me \u2018wow, that was the most incredible entrance I have ever seen.\u2019 By all accounts, it was awesome. Within seconds, I turn to my brother and go that was awesome\u2014watch what the mainstream media does. Within seconds, blue checkmark Twitter is going \u2018Trump is booed.\u2019 Such nonsense you can\u2019t even imagine it. I was sort of putting the videos up today on my Instagram feed to sort of prove the point. And that\u2019s in the heart of New York City.\u201d The media and left, Trump, Jr., said, will \u201cdo and say anything\u201d and \u201chave no morals anymore\u201d and \u201chave no compass guiding them.\u201d That, he said, is because they despise Trump so much they don\u2019t even care what the policy consequences of their lies and attacks are\u2014as long as they adhere to a preconceived narrative designed to protect failed leftist visions and attack the conservative vision of his father. \u201cIt\u2019s only outrage and hate because they don\u2019t like that you have someone actually fighting for the things that are good for the American people for a change, actually getting it done, you don\u2019t have a failed presidency with nothing but failures like you did under Barack Obama,\u201d Trump, Jr., said. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting that they don\u2019t want these things to continue\u2014record high numbers with regard to the economy, record low numbers as it relates to unemployment. All they want to do is talk about resistance and impeachment when even the people involved say there was no impeachable offense here, \u2018what are guys even talking about?\u2019 The hatred that\u2019s manifested itself from the left has just been nuts, and for me\u2014I was one of the biggest targets of that, right? Over the last three years, I was the number two target of the Mueller Hoax which was a freaking joke. We all saw in about two seconds after he got on the stand and started testifying he didn\u2019t even know where the hell he was let alone what was in his report\u2014minor details\u2014but that\u2019s why I decided it was time to write a book. I was like, \u2018you know what? We got to showcase this thing in long form.\u2019 I can only say so much in a 5-minute or 10-minute radio or TV interview, and we did just that\u2014and I think it will drive them nuts.\u201d Asked what the biggest trigger he sees from the left is, Trump, Jr., said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot,\u201d and the book gets \u201cinto all of them.\u201d He specifically cited how the tech giants have been trying to silence conservatives including himself and the radical agenda of the transgender community. \u201cWe get into internet censorship. That\u2019s obviously a huge one because if these guys can do it to me\u2014if they can shut down my Instagram account, if they can shadow ban me, if I can\u2019t show up in my search engine searching my own handle which happens to be similar to my father who is the president of the United States with 50 million followers, who aren\u2019t they silencing?\u201d Trump, Jr., said. \u201cI talk a little bit about some of the stuff going on with the trans movement, and I\u2019m like the most live and let live person you can imagine. I don\u2019t care how you identify. Guess what? If you\u2019re happy and productive, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t have to hear about it all day long, but I don\u2019t give a damn. I do start having a problem when you have men who transition to women but have all the strength, body structure, and size of a man and are competing against women who have spent their whole lives to master a sport. I do think that\u2019s a little ridiculous, and I\u2019ve called it out and even some of them have turned on their own. Even some of the LGBT leaders, who have been doing this for 30 years, have said they don\u2019t think this is right. Watch them destroy someone who\u2019s been an advocate for them for 40 years because they\u2019re apparently no longer woke enough\u2014not just blindly buying into this crap. I start saying: Where are the feminists? Where are the people who fought for all of these rights for women for all of these years? Again, I don\u2019t care what you do in your own life\u2014it\u2019s when you start really affecting other people and their lives pushing this nonsense that I start really having a problem with it. So again it\u2019s delineating all of this, and I actually probably don\u2019t take it as far as a lot of people because I\u2019m trying to actually have a reasonable dialogue with people where you can see some of this lunacy and highlight it properly.\u201d Trump, Jr., praised comedian Dave Chappelle for his recent Netflix special in which Chappelle \u201chad the guts, unlike most\u201d to stand up to this radical transgender community and against the preconceived narratives of the establishment and media. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a comedian anymore. You can\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d Trump, Jr., said. \u201c[Chappelle] is one of the best of all time. Some of the skits of his that I used to watch back in my college days, not all that long ago but long enough\u2014you could never do that stuff today. They\u2019d be like \u2018you\u2019re racist, misogynist, homophobe,\u2019 whatever it is.\u201d Trump, Jr., said the \u201cwoke culture\u201d of the left is now \u201cso insane\u201d that \u201cthe goalposts are always moving.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s never enough. The second you get what you want, then it\u2019s like \u2018let\u2019s move the goalposts even further to the extreme,\u2019\u201d Trump, Jr., said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it resonates with regular people who are again, when I talk about the trans women in female sports I always close up with: \u2018Why is it only the men turning into women that win? How come it only goes that way? How come you don\u2019t see it the other way?\u2019 I\u2019ll say this stuff on Twitter, and if I point it out or even say \u2018Good Morning\u2019 on Twitter the left will try to cancel me for it. That\u2019s one of those, surprisingly enough, that even the leftists come out and say \u2018you know what? I don\u2019t like anything Don Jr. says, I can\u2019t believe it. I can\u2019t believe that I have to agree with him on this one.\u2019 We\u2019ve gone too far. It\u2019s become asinine. So, I devote a lot of time in the book to how this is just the never-ending movement of the goalposts to achieve some sort of woke end that\u2019s always moving. It\u2019s like infinity. It keeps getting crazier and crazier. And so, I\u2019m a pretty reasonable guy on a lot of these things but eventually you lose me\u2014and you probably lose a lot of other people. I\u2019m shocked that there\u2019s not more people who have the guts to actually stand up to this craziness when I see all the people who are like \u2018yeah, I agree with him on this one.\u2019 Agreeing and then actually doing something are a little bit different\u2014that\u2019s also sort of why I had to write the book. You can see this stuff, you can disagree with it, but then eventually you have to start acting on it. I\u2019m hoping this is actually something that is seen by people on both sides as a reasonable take on some of the insanity that is today\u2019s sort of modern left.\u201d Trump, Jr., also lit into Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son. In the book, which Trump, Jr., wrote long before this current Ukraine scandal-turned-impeachment-against-Trump started, the president\u2019s son rips into Hunter Biden as well. In this interview, he explained key differences between the Bidens and the Trumps when it comes to their public life. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking about this for a year. I literally wrote and finished the book before any of that stuff even manifested itself,\u201d Trump, Jr., said of Hunter Biden. \u201cThey said, \u2018Donald Trump, Jr., you\u2019re also the son of a rich guy,\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u2018yeah, I am you\u2019re right. And a big part of me is because my dad is who he is, I totally get that.\u2019 I acknowledge that. The difference is we didn\u2019t make our fortune pretending we\u2019re public servants. We did it as business people, we were international business people for decades before we ever got into office and we stopped doing new deals abroad because of it. Hunter Biden did nothing other than get thrown out of the Navy for doing cocaine before his dad became Vice President and all of a sudden he\u2019s magically an international businessman sitting on the board of a company in a language he doesn\u2019t speak in a business he knows nothing about getting 83 grand a month. He\u2019s going over to China where the greatest investors in the world take 10 to 15 years to break in if they can ever get in and five days later he comes back with $1.5 billion after flying over there on Air Force Two with his father. There\u2019s a huge distinction. I recognize we\u2019re both where we are because of our fathers. I just didn\u2019t do it because my dad was pretending to be a public servant and utilizing all of the powers associated with therewith. He\u2019s basically taking a taxpayer-funded subsidy and getting rich because his dad\u2019s writing bills and creating laws and his dad\u2019s helping to run the U.S. I mean, I could never get away with that but for him the media is like \u2018oh no kids are off limits.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing, Hunter Biden\u2014who is 50\u2014with drug problems and a total mess and all the corruption and all of this, he\u2019s totally off limits but my younger brother Barron who\u2019s 15, he\u2019s fair game? They can attack him all day long? They can attack Tiffany, who\u2019s in law school at 25 and try to destroy her? I\u2019ve gotten to live through some of this. I\u2019ve been one of the targets. My kids have been targeted. They\u2019ve opened up exploding envelopes at our house. So yeah I\u2019ve got something to write about and it\u2019s really all covered in the book.\u201d Trump, Jr., dedicates his book Triggered to \u201cThe Deplorables,\u201d the people failed 2016 Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton maligned as \u201cdeplorable\u201d and irredeemable\u201d in the 2016 election. Her insults of the voters galvanized huge swaths of the country against her, and in favor of President Trump. Trump, Jr., said in his interview with Breitbart News Sunday that he dedicated the book to \u201cThe Deplorables\u201d because they \u201cdeserve it\u201d after everything they have been through not just in the 2016 election but since then as well after sticking with the prudent \u201cthrough thick and thin.\u201d \u201cThrough all of the hate, through all of the nonsense, through the Mueller hoax, through $40 million of U.S. taxpayer dollars with 19 Hillary Clinton donors trying to throw us all in jail, not one of those people ever doubted us,\u201d Trump, Jr., said. \u201cYou probably heard me say in my stump speech or if I\u2019m opening up for my father, I\u2019m like \u2018that wasn\u2019t a win for us.\u2019 That wasn\u2019t a win for my father. It was nice, but more importantly it was a win for those people who never even doubted us for a second. I know they\u2019re going to come out hard, they\u2019re going to bring their friends, they\u2019re going to fight for us, today is the one more year until four more years anniversary. We are exactly one year out from election day right now. I know those guys are going to be out there fighting, and they\u2019re going to make sure we get this thing across the line\u2014and we\u2019re going to do it for another four years after this year and we\u2019re going to be able to get this country going in the right direction. My father has already started changing that course aggressively with good policies, with action, despite an unprecedented amount of incoming. We\u2019re going to keep that going. But we\u2019re going to need those guys out there. So if there\u2019s anyone who deserves a dedication through all this, through all the name-calling, through all the things they\u2019ve been called, through all the hatred that those hardworking men and women who wanna make sure they can live the American dream for themselves and for their kids, man if there\u2019s someone who deserves a dedication it\u2019s them and I wanted to make sure that was recognized.\u201d LISTEN TO DONALD TRUMP, JR., ON BREITBART NEWS SUNDAY: ",

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed he submitted a notice to the United Nations, signaling the U.S. withdrawal of the symbolic agreement. \u201cIn international climate discussions, we will continue to offer a realistic and pragmatic model \u2014 backed by a record of real world results \u2014 showing innovation and open markets lead to greater prosperity, fewer emissions, and more secure sources of energy,\u201d Pompeo stated.

The agreement is largely symbolic, filled with global platitudes. Critics have long argued that the symbolic measure gives two of the biggest polluters, China and India, what essentially amounts to a free pass. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say it, it\u2019s called America First,\u201d Trump told the Pittsburgh crowd.",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " Neither Ronan Farrow nor Amy Robach came right out and said this. There job is to report the facts. But those of us whose job it is to connect the dots see a pattern so obvious it glows like neon on a moonless night in the middle of a desert. Farrow\u2019s superb Catch and Kill, his detailed and well-sourced story of his fight with NBC News to tell the truth about movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, a longtime friend of the Clintons, and successful campaign bundler for the overall Democrat Party, can only lead to this conclusion. NBC claims Farrow didn\u2019t have the story nailed down, but the far-left network ordered him to stop his reporting, claimed Farrow\u2019s dead-to-rights audio of Weinstein admitting to groping a model was not news, and just weeks after Farrow took the story elsewhere, the New Yorker ran it and Farrow won a Pulitzer. The idea Farrow did not have the story nailed down is a brazen and audacious lie. What\u2019s more, we are talking about the same NBC News that gleefully went wild reporting every unverified lie and loony rumor smearing Brett Kavanaugh, during his Supreme Court confirmation battle. This is the same NBC News that had information exonerating Kavanaugh and buried it until after the confirmation battle. No one at all familiar with NBC News believes for a moment there are any editorial standards over there, not after Kavanaugh, not after three years of devoting MSNBC to the anti-Trump Russia Collusion Hoax. No, the only time NBC decides to get a case of journalist ethics is when it comes to protecting Democrats, specifically the Clintons, specifically Hillary Clinton. Never forget that this is the very same NBC News run by the very same Andrew Lack (reportedly a Bill Clinton golfing buddy), that deliberately slow-walked Juanita Broaddrick\u2019s credible rape allegation against Bill Clinton. This was back in 1998, and in order to protect Slick Willy, the Dateline interview was stalled until just a week or so after Clinton was acquitted in his Senate impeachment trial. The interview was also broadcast at the same time as a popular awards show on a competing network. Farrow further reports he received pressure directly from the Clintons to kill the Weinstein story, even though Hillary had to know by this time about the allegations against Weinstein. So you can only imagine the pressure the Clintons must have put on their pals and golfing buddies who hold the keys to NBC\u2019s executive bathroom. Believe it or not, what ABC News is guilty of is even worse\u2026 Thanks to James O\u2019Keefe and Project Veritas, we now know ABC News not only spiked a story about Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile, Democrat donor, and friend of Bill Clinton \u2014 it was spiked during the 2016 presidential election between Hillary and Donald Trump. Caught on film and an open mic during some downtime on a ABC News set, an obviously frustrated Amy Robach expresses her anger at ABC News for \u201cquashing\u201d her Epstein reporting three years ago. The moment is a remarkably candid one, and not one \u2014 as Robach ludicrously claimed in her Tuesday statement \u2014 where she\u2019s frustrated over not being able to nail down the story. No, she\u2019s angry at ABC because she HAD the story, had an on-the-record source who had already filmed an interview; she\u2019s angry because that source had photographs to back up her allegations, angry because she had the goods on, among others, Bill Clinton; and really angry because everything about Epstein that came out three years later confirmed the story she has three years earlier. \u201cI had it all three years ago,\u201d Robach says. \u201c[My source] had pictures. She had everything.\u201d Of Prince Andrew, she says ABC \u201cquashed the story\u201d out of the fear Buckingham Palace would not allow the network to interview \u201cKate and Will.\u201d \u201cIt was unbelievable what we had. We had Clinton. We had everything.\u201d But Hillary Clinton was running for president then, and Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s documented association with her potential First Gentleman, Bill Clinton, was an obvious liability. What\u2019s more, the Big Star over at ABC News is dedicated Clintonista George Stephanopoulos who, at the time, was so closely associated with his former employers, he donated $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation \u2026 and did not disclose this while reporting on the scandals that would eventually all but destroy the corrupt foundation. And this is not the first time ABC News and its parent company Walt Disney have been caught protecting the Clintons. Back in 2006, when everyone knew Hillary was gearing up for a 2008 presidential run, Disney not only re-edited out accurate criticism of the Clinton administration\u2019s mishandling of the hunt for Osama bin Laden in its meticulously researched Path to 9/11 miniseries, after spending $40 million on the production and attracting a sizable audience, ABC/Disney memory-holed it. The Path to 9/11, which was only mildly critical of the Clinton, was never rerun or even released on home video. ABC/Disney ate $40 million to protect the Clintons. The Epstein cover up, though, is even worse. \u00a0ABC News protected a pedophile to protect the Clintons, a pedophile who was, at the time, still out on the prowl\u2026 How many victims could have been saved throughout those three years, how many girls and young women warned off or never even approached by an exposed Jeffrey Epstein? The thought of it makes you despair. There is no amount of garbage and lies ABC, NBC, and the rest of the left-wing corporate media, will not broadcast if it means destroying their ideological enemies on the political right. And there is no crime too heinous \u2014\u00a0 including rape and pedophilia \u2014 that ABC, NBC, and the rest of the left-wing corporate media, won\u2019t excuse and enable if it means protecting the Democrat Party. They are all guilty. It\u2019s a big protection racket. CNN, the New York Times, NPR, PBS, the Washington Post\u2026 Go look for their coverage of ABC burying the Epstein story. You won\u2019t find it, which makes them all accessories after the fact. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.",

      "subtitle": "Former President Barack Obama may live a stone\u2019s throw away from Virginia now, but his sway over the state\u2019s political landscape came up short on Tuesday.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Obama, who lives in the elite Washington, DC, enclave of Kalorama, has taken an interest in Virginia politics since leaving the White House. In 2017, the former president endorsed a slate of Democrat candidates running for Virginia\u2019s top three statewide offices. The following year, Obama actively actively hit the campaign trail to see Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA),\u00a0\u00a0a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and failed vice presidential candidate, reelected. This year was no different, especially with control of the Virginia General Assembly up for grabs. Last weekend, as election day neared, Obama issued an endorsement of 17 legislative candidates, he claimed were ready to advance a slew of liberal priorities in Virginia. Most of the candidates were first time office seekers, with a few incumbents thrown into the mix. \u201cProud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday\u2019s election\u2014candidates who\u2019ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly,\u201d the former president wrote on social media. \u201cThat\u2019s good policy\u2014and good for our politics.\u201d  Despite the former president\u2019s rousing endorsement, along with a hefty cash infusion from his allies across the country, a majority of the candidates failed to be elected on Tuesday. The losses by Obama\u2019s preferred candidates came even as Democrats Virginia swept to power in both chambers of the Virginia legislature, setting themselves to control all three branches of state government for the first since 1993. Such an accomplishment, while significant, cannot be attributed to Obama. Of the six Democrats the former president endorsed for the Virginia State Senate only two succeeded in garnering support at the ballot box, while three lost outright. One of the races is still too-close to call, but Republicans maintain a strong lead. Obama endorsed the Democrat candidates in Virginia Senate races in the 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th districts, and lost the 7th, 8th, and 11th districts. The 12th district has the Republican leading by two percent but has not yet been called, meaning Obama only won in the 10th and 13th districts. That means the former president went two for six in state Senate races, a measly 33 percent win rate. Obama had a slightly better, but far from perfect, track record in House of Delegates races.\u00a0In the House of Delegates races, Obama endorsed the Democrat candidates in the 21st, 27th, 28th, 40th, 51st, 66th, 83rd, 84th, 85th, 94th, and 100th districts. Democrats won the 21st, 28th, 40th, 51st, 85th, and 94th districts, and lead a not-yet-called race in the 83rd. Republicans won the 66th and 100th, and currently lead not-yet-called races in the 27th and 84th. Assuming those final margins hold, that means of the 11 candidates Obama endorsed for the House of Delegates, Obama won 7 of them\u2013and the GOP won 4\u2013and went just over 60 percent there. The losses by the Obama-endorsed candidates came even as\u00a0many led their Republican opponents handily in campaign contributions. Missy Cotter Smasal, a small business owner from Virginia Beach, Va., raised $550,000 more than the incumbent Republican she was vying to unseat, according to the Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP). Some of those funds came from top Obama donors like Michael Bills, who along with his donated more than $130,000 to Smasal\u2019s campaign, and groups allied with the former president, including Everytown for Gun Safety.\u00a0The cash lead did not translate to votes tough, as Rodman lost to the incumbent by five percentage points. There is also some evidence that victories by the two Obama-endorsed senate candidates result from factors beyond the former president\u2019s control. In Senate District 10, Ghazala Hashmi defeated incumbent Republican Sen. Glen Sturtevant by slightly more than 8,000 votes after an expensive campaign in which both candidates raised more than two million each. Sturtevant, who won the seat in 2015, was considered the Senate\u2019s most vulnerable Republican because his district, which includes portion of the city of Richmond, is heavily Democratic. According to the VPAP, the 10th Senate District voted for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over President Donald Trump by a margin of 53 percent to 41 percent in 2016. The district has only grown to favor Democrats in the years since, voting for Gov. Ralph Northam (D-VA) by a 15 percentage points in 2017 and for Kaine by 24 percentage points in 2018. A similar situation played out in Senate District 13 where Obama\u2019s endorsed candidate, John Bell, won an open seat. Bell, who represented portions of the district in the Virginia House of Delegates, easily bested his Republican opponent, the Trump-endorsed Geary Higgins, by more than 7,000 votes. The results were not that surprising given Bell\u2019s fundraising advantage\u2014$2.1 million to Higgins\u2019 $1.3 million\u2014and the district\u2019s Democrat lean. In 2016, Clinton carried it by a margin of six percentage points. Meanwhile, Northam carried it by 11 percentage points on his way to the governorship in 2017 and Kaine won it overwhelmingly by 18 points last year. Although both victories helped ensure Democrat control of the state senate, losses by the four other Obama-endorsed candidates, like Smasal, means the party is likely to only have a one seat majority in the chamber. The former president had more luck with the candidates he endorsed for the Virginia House of Delegates, albeit still failed to see them all elected. In total, six of the 11 Democrats that Obama backed won, while four lost. One race is still outstanding, but the Republican candidate is leading. As with the senate races, there were a bevy of factors behind the results. Two of the candidates Obama threw his support behind, Delegates Hala Ayala and Kelly Convirs-Fowler, were incumbents running for reelection. Both women led the money race by heavy margins, with Ayala raising nearly a million dollars more than her Republican challenger, and were running in territory favorable to Democrats. In fact most of the districts Obama-endorsed candidates won and lost were carried by Clinton in 2016 and Kaine in 2018. Some, like House District 28 in Northern Virginia, were carried by Democrats on Tuesday by small margins than in prior years. In 2016, Clinton won the district by four percentage points, before Kaine carried it by 12 points on his way to reelection last year. On Tuesday, though, the Obama-endorsed Joshua Cole only won the district by a slim margin of roughly four percentage points. A comparable political environment existed in House District 100 on Virginia\u2019s eastern shore, an area that has become increasingly friendly to Democrats in recent years. Even though Kaine won the district by 12 points in his 2018 reelection bid, the Obama-endorsed candidate, Phil Hernandez, failed to unseat the longtime Republican incumbent, Rob Bloxom. Hernandez\u2019s three point loss was especially surprising given that he had out-raised\u00a0Bloxom by more than $500,000. The failure of Obama-backed candidates like Hernandez\u2019s ensures that Democrats will have a slim majority in the Virginia House of Delegates next session. In a twist of irony, the Democrats narrow majority could end up slowing the very advancements in \u201cequality, justice, and decency\u201d the former president invoked when issuing his endorsements last week.",

Tell me, form your opinion, does his current behavior surprise you at all? HILLARY CLINTON: Totality! Look, he was a tough guy, he was a mayor, he was mayor during 9/11 when I was a senator. I worked with him. I don\u2019t know what happened. It\u2019s almost like aliens have seized his brain. For the longest time he was saying things that demonstrably untrue.

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " Businessman Eddie Rispone, the GOP candidate for governor, is experiencing a surge of support from Republicans statewide unifying behind his candidacy as he rises in the polls in what is shaping up to be a tight photo finish on the bayou. After getting into the runoff back in the October 12 jungle primary, Rispone has quickly unified Republicans in Louisiana behind his campaign, bringing in most of the senior team behind his chief GOP rival Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-LA) during that round. Abraham quickly endorsed Rispone that night as he conceded the race, and now,\u00a0his team is working to ensure Rispone is victorious in the Louisiana gubernatorial runoff on Saturday, November 16. Incumbent Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards, meanwhile, has turned to national Democrats like former President Barack Obama and failed 2016 Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s team for help. Edwards\u2019 team is also internally fighting, sources with knowledge of the matter say, over control of the message and reins of the campaign as these new national Democrats with Clinton ties fly into Louisiana to work for his team in the home stretch after he underperformed expectations back on October 12. As Breitbart News reported, Edwards has brought in veteran Hillary Clinton Democrat staffer Scott Arceneaux in the runoff to help with his campaign in the final home stretch. What\u2019s more, former President Obama recorded a robocall for Edwards on election day back on October 12 urging Louisiana voters to \u201cget out and vote for Gov. John Bel Edwards.\u201d Lionel Rainey, a top adviser previously to Abraham who is now working for the Republican Governors Association (RGA) to elect Rispone as the GOP unifies in the state, told Breitbart News that the contrast between both sides could not be clearer.\n\n\u201cConservatives are uniting and Democrats are infighting over who\u2019s getting paid,\u201d Rainey said. \u201cJohn Bel\u2019s team is fractured and in full-blown panic mode. They\u2019re desperate. It\u2019s almost sad to watch it happening. You could see it in the governor\u2019s performance during the debate. \u201cConfident\u201d would not be an adjective I would use to describe it. They know it\u2019s coming to an end, and they can\u2019t handle it. And President Trump hasn\u2019t even come back in yet for the runoff. They might have a seizure when he takes the stage before Election Day. There\u2019s a red wave coming in Louisiana. We\u2019re going to take back the governor\u2019s seat and have a supermajority of conservatives in the Statehouse and Senate. The days of Louisiana finishing last are coming to an end. It\u2019s exciting.\u201d President Donald Trump is headed to Louisiana on Wednesday night to campaign again for Rispone. He appeared before the October 12 jungle primary alongside both Rispone and Abraham back then, urging Louisiana voters to back either one in the October 12 race to keep Edwards under 50 percent and force this runoff. Rispone made it to the runoff, lining up the battle that is coming up next week. Trump has been very active in the race, weighing in repeatedly to help Rispone too:     One of the key strategies of Edwards\u2019 team in the home stretch has been to try to divide Abraham and Rispone supporters in the runoff, to keep Rispone from coalescing enough support to get over the top. On October 12, Edwards finished with an abysmal 46.6 percent, Rispone got 27.4 percent, and Abraham got 23.6 percent\u2014for a combined GOP total of 51 percent. But Edwards\u2019 strategy is not working particularly well, GOP sources in the state say, because of how quickly and swiftly Abraham and his team have rallied behind Rispone. Part of the reason why Trump is heading to Monroe, Louisiana, in the northern part of the state\u2014Abraham\u2019s congressional district and his turf\u2014on Wednesday night is that Abraham personally called the president and asked him to come there specifically to help Rispone. Abraham confirmed this in a tweet last week when the rally was announced:  With Tuesday\u2019s likely loss in Kentucky\u2019s governor\u2019s race\u2014the Associated Press still has not called the race, but Republican incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin trailed by several thousand votes to Democrat Attorney General Andy Beshear in a race Bevin has as of now not conceded\u2014the stakes in Louisiana get higher heading into next week. The Louisiana race offers Republicans an opportunity for redemption and the ability to legitimately claim that Kentucky was a one-off and not a trend nationally against Republicans.",

The resounding \u201cno\u201d from voters to become a sanctuary city for illegal aliens came as a shock to the open borders lobby who had hoped that the city\u2019s 43 percent Hispanic population would help push the plan over the finish line. In neighboring states, sanctuary cities have proven to mass-release criminal illegal aliens whom Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) must then find. In Los Angeles, California, for example, federal officials say the sanctuary city frees up to 100 criminal illegal aliens every day. As Breitbart News reported, up to 80 percent of illegal aliens freed back into the general public by sanctuary cities go on to commit additional crimes. These are crimes that would have otherwise been prevented if those illegal aliens had been turned over to ICE. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

He added: I could see her going down that route because she\u2019s not going to stop with just being the Duchess of Sussex. There\u2019s much more to Meghan and I think we\u2019re only just beginning to see the early days of what Meghan Markle will really do now that she has this global platform. Bullen has been making programs about the British Royal family for nearly 20 years, and has worked with Harry\u2019s father, Prince Charles, for eight. He recently released a new documentary titled Meghan for President? which explores the former American actress\u2019 viewes on gender and race, as well as her commitment to philanthropic causes. Bullen says the world shouldn\u2019t be surprised if Markle would consider taking on a humanitarian ambassador\u2019s role in the states or even setting her eyes further on politics. Based on rare footage of Markle\u2019s upbringing, along with statements from those who knew her, he says Markle has always yearned to make a change long before she became a familiar face on television.  His speculation comes as Markle and husband Prince Harry embark on an entended six-week break from their Royal duties and head across the Atlantic for time in California\u00a0where they\u2019ll be celebrating Thanksgiving with Meghan\u2019s mother, Doria Ragland. The Duchess has already expressed her desires for her son to grow up aware of his American heritage. Her only previous public protestations of political interest came in 2016 when Markle \u2014 as she then was \u2014 endorsed Hillary Clinton and branded U.S. President Donald Trump \u201cmisogynistic [and] vocal about it\u201d ahead of the U.S. elections that year. \u201cYou\u2019re not just voting for a woman if it\u2019s Hillary. Yes, you\u2019re voting because she\u2019s a woman, but certainly because Trump has made it easy to see that you don\u2019t really want that kind of world that he\u2019s painting,\u201d she added. The president was charitable towards the Duchess even after hearing she had expressed a dim view of him, however, saying he thought it was nice to have an American princess, and that he was\u00a0\u201csure she will do excellently, she will be very good.\u201d More recently the Duchess was applauded by\u00a0Former First Lady Michelle Obama who said the Duchess of Sussex is \u201cbreaking the mold\u201d as one of the world\u2019s \u201cthoughtful leaders.\u201d Her ringing endorsement follows that of former first lady and failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton who has called the Suits actor an \u201cinspiration.\u201d",

She said: This message and this warning that\u2019s come from Hillary Clinton as well as her proxies and the foreign policy establishment elite in Washington that says if you stand up against them, if you dissent, if you, as I am, are calling for an end to our country\u2019s long-held foreign policy of being the world\u2019s police, toppling dictators in countries we don\u2019t like, if you do that then your character will be smeared, just as they are trying to smear my character and undermine my campaign. Gabbard is running in the Democrat primary election for 2020, challenging the foreign policy orthodoxy of \u201cregime change wars.\u201d She\u00a0said the foreign policy establishment was bipartisan as both Democrats and Republicans spent $6 trillion in the Middle East since the 9/11 terror attacks and supported regime-change wars. \u201cThis is the Clinton/Bush legacy of foreign policy of being the world\u2019s police, going around toppling dictators we don\u2019t like, helping support and prop up the ones that apparently we do,\u201d she said, criticizing \u201cunnecessary costly wars\u201d in the Middle East. If elected president, Gabbard said she would dramatically end foreign engagements overseas which she argued only weakened the United States. She concluded: \u201cI would go farther, and say maybe for Hillary Clinton it has been very effective but it\u2019s been counterproductive to the interests of our country, it has directly strengthened terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda, undermining our national security, not to speak of the toll that it\u2019s taken in human lives, both American lives as well as the lives of the people in the countries where we\u2019ve waged these wars.\u201d",

The goal is absolutely\u00a0\u2014 and compare where we are as a Democratic Party, engaged in a debate about the best way to achieve this goal, where a Republican Party tried to repeal the Affordable Healthcare Act with nothing ever introduced to replace it. Not only that, they are in court right now to strick the entire law down. It could be, unless the judges who are hearing this case decide to hold off for a year, it could be in the midst of this election, you will get a decision sought by the Republican Party, led by Republican attorneys generals from a number of states, to completely declare the Affordable Healthcare Act unconstitutional. And if that happens, it will be the absolute most stark comparison between the Republican Party, that never produced a bill in Congress to replace what they were trying to repeal\u2026 and it strikes me that, yeah, we\u2019re having a debate on our side of the ledger, but it\u2019s a debate about the right issue.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Gabbard appeared on\u00a0Breitbart News Daily\u00a0on Thursday and spoke to Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, who asked the presidential hopeful to weigh in on the prominence of cancel culture and explain how she deals with it as a Democrat who is willing to speak across the aisle:  \u201cI\u2019m not running to just be the president of Democrats or one group or tribe or another. I\u2019m asking the American people \u2013 every single American \u2013 for the opportunity to be of service of them to serve and lead them as President of the United States, as commander-in-chief,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cIn order to do that, you\u2019ve got to be willing to speak to and to listen to all Americans,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou get hatred on social media simply for showing up and having a conversation,\u201d Marlow said of implications of cancel culture, asking Gabbard, \u201cHow difficult is this for you to deal with as someone who does want to speak across the aisle?\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s important, again, for both leaders in our country and people to stand up for the right to free speech to encourage dialogue and discourse and debate around the issues that concern all of us,\u201d she said, calling the promotion of cancel culture \u2013 which is embraced by elites in Hollywood, particularly \u2013 a \u201cdisservice to our country.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a disservice to our country and, frankly, dangerous to promote this, as you said\u2013this cancel culture\u2013because it creates a culture of fear, frankly, for people who want to speak out, who want to share their views and their opinions,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of things people say that I disagree with, that I disagree strongly with, but, you know, look, I\u2019m a soldier,\u201d the presidential hopeful continued. \u201cI\u2019m willing to lay my life down for the protection and defense of our rights and freedoms in this country, and I think that that\u2019s where we need to get back to as a country rather than thinking that those who disagree with us should be silenced or canceled or told to shut up,\u201d she added. It is true that Gabbard, who topped both the Drudge Report and Breitbart News\u2019s straw polls following the Democrat presidential debates she participated in, appeals to a broader base. The congresswoman attributed that to her ability to operate outside of the intolerant cancel culture promoted by elites in Hollywood, D.C., and media. \u201cI\u2019m not turning my back on any one group or another in this country. And in this cancel culture, that goes a long way just to say, \u2018Hey, everyone is welcome. There\u2019s no one that we\u2019ll turn away at our door,'\u201d she said. Marlow mentioned Hillary Clinton \u2013 who once\u00a0assessed\u00a0that Breitbart News may not have the right to exist \u2013 and described her as one who\u00a0\u201cexemplifies cancel culture.\u201d Gabbard said the tension between herself and the twice-failed presidential candidate amounts to much more than a petty spat: This thing that has rolled out over the last few weeks, I think it\u2019s important to point out that this is not just, \u201cWell, she doesn\u2019t like me or I don\u2019t like her.\u201d\u00a0 There\u2019s a deeper issue and contrast here, and that issue really is, I think there are two main things here. Number one, what we\u2019ve seen play out is this message and this warning that\u2019s come from Hillary Clinton as well as her proxies and the foreign policy establishment elite in Washington that says if you stand up against them, if you dissent, if you, as I am calling for an end to our country\u2019s long-held foreign policy of being the world\u2019s police, toppling dictators in countries we don\u2019t like, if you do that, then your character will be smeared just as they are trying to smear my character under my campaign. \u201cIf you do this, you, too, will be smeared,\u201d she added, harkening back to her remarks on the dangers of cancel culture.",

      "subtitle": "Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is again considering running for the Democrat nomination for president in 2020 after previously ruling out a run, a move that comes as former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has filed presidential primary paperwork in Alabama signaling he may be a late entrant to the race.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " All of this comes as speculation builds that former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the failed 2016 Democrat presidential nominee, may run again in 2020 as well. Holder did very publicly flirt with running in 2020 before, even making the rounds to travel to some early presidential states for key speeches, but he ultimately announced earlier this year he would not run. In March 2019, he came out and said he would not be running in 2020 and that he planned to instead focus his efforts on redistricting efforts. But now, given how weak the rest of the Democrat presidential field is in 2020, and with other top talent showing that the water is definitely still warm, Holder appears to be reconsidering and thinking about getting into the race after all. Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson reported late Thursday evening that Holder has been discussing a late entrance into the crowded Democrat field with a handful of close advisers and political consultants:  The news that Holder is reconsidering his decision to bow out on 2020 comes as Bloomberg has filed paperwork in Alabama, which has a Friday filing deadline, to run for president. He has not yet, according to multiple reports, made a decision on whether he will run for president or not, but filing paperwork in Alabama ensures he would have a shot at ballot access there should he mount a national campaign for the Democrat nomination. Politico reported Thursday night: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is preparing to file paperwork to qualify for the Democratic presidential primary in Alabama, ahead of a Friday deadline. The move would be a first step toward a national campaign, though Bloomberg has not made a final decision to run. Bloomberg aide Howard Wolfson is quoted in the story as well, suggesting that Bloomberg is actively considering jumping into the still-crowded 2020 Democrat presidential primary field. Wolfson said: We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated \u2014 but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that. If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America\u2019s biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America\u2019s toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist. All of this comes as Clinton, whom some have speculated may get in herself, again toyed with the idea publicly during an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin this week and then tweeted video of the joke:  Clinton, Bloomberg, and now Holder all considering late entrances to the crowded 2020 Democrat presidential primary field comes as its onetime frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden, has proven particularly weak against his opponents. Biden\u2019s deep corruption concerns with regard to his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealing in Ukraine and China, and potentially elsewhere around the world in shoes yet to drop, have Democrats concerned that a much more radical leftist like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) could win the Democrat nomination. While the hard left of the Democrat Party led by the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d believes that nominating a leftist socialist like Sanders or Warren would energize the party\u2019s base and bring an army to take on President Donald Trump and his base in November 2020, more establishment Democrats are concerned that Warren or Sanders being the nominee would turn off battleground voters and cede the White House back to Trump in 2020. Most of the \u201cSquad,\u201d\u00a0Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY),\u00a0 Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) endorsed Sanders since the last Democrat debate in October, while the freshman group\u2019s fourth member Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) endorsed Warren. Members have insisted there is no divide in the group. Biden\u2019s polling numbers have steadily sunk in recent months, to the point where he has lost the frontrunner status he enjoyed at the beginning of his campaign. Warren has replaced Biden as the frontrunner in many national polls, and especially in several key battleground states. Biden\u2019s numbers keep slipping as the public learns more and more about his son\u2019s position on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where he was paid more than $80,000 per month. Questionable Hunter Biden dealings in China, too, have put a spotlight on Biden corruption concerns, all of which in their totality are a nearly daily national news story given the fact that House Democrats have decided to proceed with an impeachment inquiry into President Trump over the fact that Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s new president to investigate corruption including what happened with Hunter Biden and Burisma. If Bloomberg or Clinton decided to launch national presidential campaigns in the next few weeks, they would have considerable resources at the ready. Bloomberg, a billionaire, has immense financial resources at his disposal, while Clinton as the party\u2019s nominee in 2016 and the former first lady, as well as a leader with a national profile and universal name identification among voters, would quickly be able to assemble the structures necessary to compete in the upcoming primaries and caucuses. Holder, though, may have a rougher go of it given that he\u2019s never run a national campaign before and does not have the financial resources of Bloomberg:  Holder does have deep ties to former President Barack Obama, however, and is considered a favorite among the Democrat base given the work he did to help Obama cover up a variety of scandals, including most notably the Operation Fast and Furious scandal. Holder\u2019s coverup of documents on behalf of Obama, who asserted executive privilege to withhold the information from Congress, led to him being the first-ever and only sitting Attorney General of the United States to be held in contempt of Congress. The U.S. House in 2012 voted Holder into both civil and criminal contempt of Congress over the Fast and Furious scandal, just one of many scandals that plagued Holder\u2019s Department of Justice.",

Both Warren and Sanders have unveiled radical redistribution plans as key features of their presidential platforms. Warren\u2019s \u201cUltra-Millionaire Tax\u201d targets individuals with more than $50 million in assets, levying a two percent tax, which goes up to three percent for those with more than $1 billion in assets. However, her $52 trillion Medicare for All plan increases the taxes on the ultra-wealthy, \u201casking billionaires to pitch in six cents on each dollar of net worth above $1 billion.\u201d Sanders\u2019 plan also targets America\u2019s ultra-wealthy, proposing a one percent tax on couples with a net worth in excess of $32 million: The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. \u201cBillionaires should not exist,\u201d he declared following his plan\u2019s rollout:  Clinton signaled that neither of their proposals is feasible. \u201cIf you were going to do a wealth tax and it was on assets \u2026 how you would value it is, I think, complicated to start with,\u201d she said. \u201cBut assume you can get some system of evaluation, people would literally have to sell assets to pay the tax on the assets that they owned before the wealth tax was levied,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat would be incredibly disruptive, so I think there are other ways to raise the revenues,\u201d she added. Both Warren and Sanders took aim at billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who is close to making a decision on a presidential bid, following the reports that he filed\u00a0presidential primary paperwork in Alabama ahead of the deadline. \u201cWelcome to the race, @MikeBloomberg! If you\u2019re looking for policy plans that will make a huge difference for working people and which are very popular, start here,\u201d Warren tweeted, providing a link to her calculator \u201cfor the billionaires.\u201d \u201cThe billionaire class is scared and they should be scared,\u201d Sanders tweeted following the news.",

      "subtitle": "The elite class and Hillary Clinton, specifically, are unsatisfied with the current Democrat primary field and have signaled their dissatisfaction in a variety of ways in recent weeks, from refusing to endorse former Vice President Joe Biden (D) to dismissing the ultra-far-left candidates\u2019 radical agendas.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " There is no shortage of candidates in the current Democrat primary field. Democrats have, on paper, everything they have claimed to want in terms of diversity in their lineup. They have multiple women \u2014 Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), and self-help guru Marianne Williamson (D). They have candidates who represent racial minorities \u2014 Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) \u2014 as well as a candidate who embodies their self-proclaimed devotion to the LGBT community. Yet, despite that, Democrat elites like Clinton are unsatisfied, indicating a deepening divide within the Democrat Party. The first presidential primary is less than three months away, yet select Democrats are still mulling a last-minute run. On Thursday, reports indicated that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg filed presidential primary paperwork in Alabama, with sources adding that he is \u201cclose\u201d to coming up with a final decision on a presidential bid. Similarly, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is reportedly considering a long-shot bid, and Hillary Clinton has been teasing a run for weeks, failing to use her recent interviews to quash the rumors. It has been widely believed among Democrats that Bloomberg and Clinton would not run unless Biden, who was long believed to be the unshakeable frontrunner, showed signs of wavering. Both Warren and Sanders have managed to put a dent in his support, keeping potential candidates like Clinton on the fence and prepared to pounce. Bloomberg\u2019s, Holder\u2019s, and Clinton\u2019s purported considerations speak volumes about the state of the current Democrat field. Democrat elites are unsatisfied with the choices, fearing Biden\u2019s lack of stamina in a general election matchup against Trump and questioning the electability of Warren and Sanders, who have unabashedly embraced far-left proposals and positions that strategic Democrats, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), have long attempted to keep at bay. Clinton has openly criticized the positions of Warren and Sanders, causing some to wonder if she is subtly attempting to undermine the field or in the very least, influence the candidates\u2019 positions. She appeared at the\u00a0New York Times\u2019\u00a0DealBook conference this week and took aim at ultra-wealthy tax proposals and Medicare for All \u2014 two progressive plans both Warren and Sanders not only support, but champion. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how that could work, and I don\u2019t see other examples anywhere else in the world where it has actually worked over a long period of time,\u201d Clinton\u00a0said of the wealth tax proposals, calling them \u201ccomplicated.\u201d \u201cIf you were going to do a wealth tax and it was on assets \u2026 how you would value it is, I think, complicated to start with,\u201d she said. \u201cBut assume you can get some system of evaluation, people would literally have to sell assets to pay the tax on the assets that they owned before the wealth tax was levied,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat would be incredibly disruptive, so I think there are other ways to raise the revenues,\u201d she added. Clinton also expressed doubt that Warren\u2019s $52 trillion Medicare for All plan would ever pass. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Clinton replied when asked if she thought Warren\u2019s plan would pass. \u201cI don\u2019t, but the goal is the right goal. \u201d \u201cI believe the smarter approach is to build on what we have, a public option is something I\u2019ve been in favor of for a very long time. I don\u2019t believe we should be in the midst of a big disruption while we are trying to get to 100 percent coverage and deal with costs,\u201d she added. Clinton has also taken direct aim at candidates like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), calling her a \u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d and suggesting that she is a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d \u201cThey [Republicans] know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it,\u201d Clinton said on the Campaign HQ podcast with Barack Obama\u2019s former campaign manager David Plouffe last month. Time and time again, rather than encouraging Democrats to rally behind a candidate in the existing presidential primary field, Clinton has subtly hinted that she could jump in the race instead. In October, President Trump tweeted that \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d should join the race \u201cto try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren\u201d as long as she explains \u201call of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u2018C\u2019 Subpoena!\u201d Clinton replied, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job,\u201d and fueled further speculation during an appearance on\u00a0PBS NewsHour. \u201cMaybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, just seriously, I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\u201d Clinton kicked off an additional 2020 buzz on social media after posting a quote from\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9 about the need to \u201ctake\u201d power:   @Beyonce speaks the truth.\u2063 \u2063 #GutsyWomen A post shared by  Hillary Clinton (@hillaryclinton) on Oct 22, 2019 at 10:03am PDT The twice-failed presidential candidate\u2019s book tour has almost doubled as an outlet to express her views on the 2020 race. She dropped yet another doubtful analysis of the current 2020 field during an event at Portland\u2019s Revolution Hall last month, suggesting that it would be nearly impossible for anyone in the current field to unseat Trump in the next election in the event that he is not impeached. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know who\u2019s going to be the best candidate to beat this president, assuming this president is still running,\u201d she said. She continued: We have a number of very able, very admirable candidates who are vying for the nomination, but at the end of the day, there are a lot of forecasters who are saying, \u2018Look, if the economy stays in good shape and he\u2019s not impeached, or he\u2019s impeached but not convicted, it\u2019s going to be very, very hard,\u2019 because of all of the advantages that he will have on the stuff we were just talking about like suppression and everything else. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has done little to extinguish the mounting rumors, explaining that his wife \u201cmay or may not ever run for anything\u201d during an appearance at Georgetown Law\u2019s second annual Ruth Bader Ginsburg Lecture in Washington, DC, last month. Most recently, Clinton dodged a question on whether she is planning a last-minute jump into the race, reverting to jogging jokes at the New York Times\u2019 DealBook conference. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, to run? You know, I have always been a very, very slow runner. I am embarrassingly slow,\u201d she said, continuing her bit. \u201cThere\u2019s been some teasing and some hinting that, maybe, you\u2019re sitting off in the wings here and waiting for some moment,\u201d Andrew Ross Sorkin said. Clinton, however, refused to answer the question directly:  Look, I think I would have been a really good president. I think I could have been a very effective leader. We have real divides in the country over all kinds of things, but I certainly, in my time in the Senate and secretary of state, worked really hard, as you say, to actually solve problems, not exacerbate them or ignore them. I would have done everything I could to try to get us positioned for the future. That\u2019s what a leader is supposed to do. Elections are supposed to be about the future and leadership should be about the future. I think I could have done a really good job. I think the last election was deeply flawed and that there were so many unprecedented problems in that election that it\u2019s almost hard to make sense of. Sources for both the New York Times and Washington Post have said that Clinton has not ruled out a presidential bid and is actively keeping an eye on it, which is overwhelmingly evident to those who have been tracking her latest remarks. The possible late entrances \u2014 from Clinton, Bloomberg, and Holder \u2014 indicate the growing worry over not only the direction of the Democrat field but the Democrat Party\u2019s ability to defeat Trump in 2020. While Democrat voters are more open to radical policies, such as Medicare for All and multitrillion dollar proposals to combat climate change, there are growing concerns that those proposals will not bode well for the left in a general election matchup. Despite that, Sanders, who remains a top-tier candidate, is boldly running with his multitrillion-dollar, big government proposals and has garnered support from three individuals largely demonstrative of the ideological divide within the party: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ilhan Omar (D-MN). Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s infamous feud with Pelosi over the summer was almost a foreshadowing of the internal strife to be seen within the Democrat Party in the presidential primary. There is an ongoing, although largely unsaid, matchup between establishment Democrats and the unabashedly socialist \u201cnew\u201d left. Ultimately, the Democrat establishment worries the progressive flank will hand Trump, and his MAGA agenda, four more years in the White House.",

      "subtitle": "Businessman Eddie Rispone, the GOP candidate for governor in Louisiana in next Saturday\u2019s runoff election, ripped leftist Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards as \u201cbeholden\u201d to \u201ctrial lawyers\u201d in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News this weekend.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " Appearing on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel ahead of the all-important LSU-versus-Alabama football game that President Donald Trump is attending, Rispone laid out his case for why Louisiana should reject Edwards\u2019 leftist Democrat vision and instead install him\u2014a conservative businessman, like Trump\u2014as the state\u2019s next governor. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily important. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to turn our state around,\u201d Rispone said. \u201cWe\u2019re last\u2014we\u2019ve been last now for several years. The governor doesn\u2019t want to admit that, but we\u2019ve been ranked last for the last three years in a row. It\u2019s an opportunity we can\u2019t pass up. We\u2019re going to have a conservative House and a conservative Senate, and what we need is a governor who\u2019s conservative\u2014an outsider, someone with serious business skills. Just as important, we need someone who\u2019s not beholden to special interests. This governor is completely beholden to the trial lawyers. He was one. He can\u2019t get anything done. He\u2019s killing thousands of jobs, literally thousands of jobs in the oil and gas industry. We have the second highest auto insurance in the country. It\u2019s killing jobs, and it\u2019s also just really hurting the middle and lower income families\u2014they can\u2019t pay the premiums. You have to make choices between rent and utilities and things of that nature. This just has to be done, it\u2019s an opportunity we can\u2019t pass up.\u201d President Trump has already done two rallies with Rispone\u2014one before the Oct. 12 runoff where Rispone edged out Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-LA) to face off against the Democrat Edwards in the Nov. 16 runoff, and the other last week during early voting\u2014and he is planning lots more to help Rispone. The topic is almost certainly going to come up during Trump\u2019s appearance at the LSU-Alabama game on Saturday afternoon, and Trump is likely headed back to Louisiana next week for another rally with Rispone. Rispone said that Edwards, through his Democrat policies, has been blocking the people of Louisiana from experiencing the full effect of the booming Trump economy because the state has been struggling under Edwards. Just this weekend, an editorial in the Wall Street Journal blasted Edwards for protecting trial lawyers like Edwards was before he was elected\u2014something that\u2019s been crushing economic opportunity in the state. \u201cThe president does really care about Louisiana and he\u2019s been here, that\u2019s why he\u2019s down here. He does want us to share in what I call the Trump wave,\u201d Rispone said. \u201cOur economy is the slowest in the south. I don\u2019t want to go through the litany of those things, but you asked what I\u2019m going to do\u2014immediately after I\u2019m sworn in, I\u2019m going to let the job creators know that we have someone who knows how to create jobs and has worked with job creators for 40 years and bring those jobs back but keep the jobs we have here. Our governor and his trial lawyer friends are killing thousands of jobs in the oil and gas industry alone. Twenty thousand jobs have left here, and we\u2019ve had over 70,000 citizens leave our state.\u201d If and when he is sworn in as governor, Rispone said, he\u2019s going to let industry know there\u2019s a \u201cdifferent sheriff in town\u201d who will stand up for jobs and the state\u2019s economy against special interests. \u201cSo, immediately, I\u2019m going to let the oil and gas industry know they\u2019ve got a different sheriff in town, someone who\u2019s going to go after these trial lawyers who are killing these thousands of jobs,\u201d Rispone said. \u201cI\u2019m not beholden to trial lawyers like he is. And we\u2019re going to fix this insurance that\u2019s killing thousands of jobs as well as costing our citizens a tax. I mean they\u2019re paying a thousand to two thousand dollars a year more, and it\u2019s really hurting the lower and middle income families. Immediately, we\u2019re going to go after this lawsuit abuse and fix that, and let them know we have a governor who understands job creation and is going to work for them to create jobs for our citizens. We should be number one in the south when it comes to jobs and opportunities, and we are last. I use this analogy: If LSU was last in the SEC, we\u2019d fire everyone from the president of the university down to the poor water boy. It\u2019s time we do the same thing in our state government. We\u2019re going to have a very conservative House and Senate, we need someone in the governor\u2019s seat who can work with them and move our state forward. That\u2019s very simple.\u201d Rispone added that he considers this trial lawyer \u201cabuse\u201d to be a force \u201cdestroying\u201d opportunity for hardworking families in Louisiana. \u201cIt\u2019s not only blocking [economic success],\u201d Rispone said. \u201cThey\u2019re destroying it. This lawsuit abuse, I\u2019m telling you, has driven out thousands of jobs in the oil and gas industry and cost us to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues because we\u2019re not getting the oil and gas out of the ground.\u201d Rispone, a successful businessman who\u2019s hired thousands of people over his career, said he considers this election to be like a \u201cjob interview.\u201d \u201cYou mentioned something earlier comparing us. This is a job interview,\u201d Rispone said. \u201cWe have a $30 billion plus operation here in the state government. We have a liberal, tax-and-spend trial lawyer as our CEO. It\u2019s time to get someone who understands how to be a CEO, someone with serious business skills, and someone who knows how to recruit talented people. Someone who can get a plan together. Someone who can make it accountable, and understands all these things. It\u2019s time to do something different. He keeps appointing these political cronies over at these agencies, and they\u2019re not functioning like they should. They\u2019re not giving the citizens what they pay for. So, it\u2019s very easy: Just look at it like a resume. See which one you want as your CEO of a $30 billion operation\u2014it\u2019s someone who\u2019s not beholden to these special interests, and it\u2019s certainly not someone who\u2019s beholden to these trial lawyers who are killing thousands of jobs. I think it\u2019s a very simple observation to make.\u201d On top of all of Edwards\u2019 radical leftist policies standing in the way of economic success, Rispone said, he is \u201cone of them\u201d\u2014a card-carrying member of the institutional left and hard-left wing of the Democrat Party. \u201cHe was a super delegate for Hillary Clinton, right off the bat,\u201d Rispone said of Edwards. \u201cThen, what did he do? He allows New Orleans to be a sanctuary city. He does\u2014he says it\u2019s not, but they have a protest against ICE and he supports it and didn\u2019t come out against it. We all know that sanctuary cities encourage illegal immigration and we know we have crisis with illegal immigration and he just sits there and allows that to happen\u2014and then when they protest ICE, he didn\u2019t say a word. Sanctuary cities encourage illegal immigration and it\u2019s a threat to our safety and it eats up our hard-earned tax dollars. These people, he paid over $16 million in benefits to illegal immigrants. This guy is a liberal. Believe me, when it comes time next year to endorse whoever the idiot running against\u2014the lunatic, the leftist, socialist running against our president, he\u2019s going to endorse them. He is one of them. Then, on top of that, he\u2019s taking millions of dollars from all these socialist Democrats from around the country\u2014millions\u2014and he\u2019s going to say he\u2019s not one of them? Go tell somebody else that.\u201d As governor, if he is elected, Rispone said he will stop the taxpayer-funded welfare payments to illegal aliens and he will work to pass a law with the legislature to ban sanctuary cities like New Orleans in the state\u2014a law that every other state in the south has passed except for Louisiana because Edwards blocked the efforts to pass it. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple. Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas all have laws that if a city within the state does not cooperate with the immigration laws, they cut off state funding to that city,\u201d Rispone said. \u201cThey\u2019ve passed the laws. What they all have in common is a Republican governor. Our governor helped kill a bill that we tried to pass in a session, I don\u2019t know which one it was in the previous session, but we will have the same law. He supports sanctuary cities. He\u2019s a liberal. He\u2019s a radical liberal who tries to project that he\u2019s not. He cozies up to the president but then he\u2019s going to support whoever runs against this president, whichever liberal. He says he\u2019s not tied to the national party, but then he takes millions of their dollars to run for governor. Between the trial lawyers and the liberal Democrats, they have given him over $10 million for this campaign. Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s not a liberal. He\u2019s completely beholden to them and he\u2019s one of them.\u201d Edwards has also brought in senior former Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign staff to run his campaign, used robocalls from former President Barack Obama\u2014who may be appearing in Louisiana for him in the home stretch\u2014and associated with people like House Financial Services committee chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) and \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). \u201cHe keeps doing that, and tries to get it out, but then when he\u2019s caught on it he says \u2018oh no, I didn\u2019t do that,\u2019\u201d Rispone said when asked about Edwards\u2019 association with such Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s just like taxes. He had several special sessions to raise our taxes $5 billion. Thank God we fought him through seven special sessions\u2014it would have been $10 billion. But he\u2019s going to say that was a bipartisan situation. He sent letters to the elderly and the nursing homes, very confusing threatening letters that they would be kicked out of the nursing homes if we didn\u2019t raise taxes. That\u2019s the kind of guy this is. It\u2019s all about the fear mongering tactics to raise taxes. This is a typical, typical, liberal tax-and-spend playbook. Fear monger, fear monger, fear monger, fear monger, make promises and then once you get elected do nothing to make the state better. That\u2019s the way he\u2019s been doing it.\u201d What\u2019s more, Edwards released a whole bunch of career criminals\u2014including several violent ones\u2014from prison. \u201cThe whole process he went through, he wasn\u2019t interested in lowering the recidivism rate,\u201d Rispone said. \u201cHe was interested in getting as many people out of there so he could say he lowered the number incarcerated. He just rode it out terribly so. But the telling thing, on top of that, he had over 200 pardons and over 100 of those were violent criminals\u201416 of them were murderers, two of them were child molesters, and one of them was a rapist. One of those murderers he let out, the daughter of the victim had sent him a letter requesting that he do not do that\u2014he never responded to her. He never even reached out to the family of the victim. On the night of the debate, he kept denying it and saying \u2018I didn\u2019t do that, I didn\u2019t do that.\u2019 It\u2019s a fact. Sixteen murderers, two child molesters, and a rapist. He pardoned those, and got them out of prison. You can\u2019t deny that. That\u2019s what he is, he\u2019s a liberal.\u201d LISTEN TO BUSINESSMAN EDDIE RISPONE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY: ",

In it they\u00a0share the stories of the women who have inspired them, with the 16-year-old Swede among them. Thunberg was included in the book one year ago when the mother-daughter duo read about her solitary climate strike in front of Swedish parliament. \u201cWe were so moved by it,\u201d Clinton said at Southbank Centre\u2019s Royal Festival Hall. Since then, Greta has sailed across the Atlantic and spoken at the U.N. about climate change, both events Clinton claims add to the mystification of male political leaders,\u00a0repeating a message she delivered in September when she gushed over Thunberg\u2019s emotional speech at the United Nations\u2019 Climate Action Summit, calling it \u201crequired viewing for every lawmaker.\u201d Now she has returned to the topic. \u201cIt\u2019s been fascinating to watch how scared a lot of grown up male leaders are of this young 16-year-old girl who speaks up about the threat of climate change,\u201d Clinton said in London. \u201cShe is a young women, so the idea that she is standing up and speaking out as effectively as she has just rattles all of the paradigms that people still live with.\u201d Clinton pointed to what she called, \u201cancient DNA imprinting\u201d that determines \u201c\u2018This is what women are supposed to do and this is what they are supposed to look like\u2019 and you are not supposed to be so pushy and aggressive \u2026 it is maddening how much that still operates.\u201d Elsewhere in the discussion, Clinton said she had \u201calways admired Britain\u201deven if the current state of politics confuses her. She added: \u201cI am, as a great admirer, concerned because I can\u2019t make sense of what is happening.\u201d she also said she found the same bafflement with U.S. politics. \u201cIn my own country as well. I don\u2019t understand it\u2026. It\u2019s hard to figure out exactly where you\u2019re headed.\u201d As for her own political heroes, Clinton said former U.S. President Barack Obama is a role model for modern men. \u201cI think Barack Obama was a very gutsy person but who worked so, so hard not to let it show,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knew the undercurrents that were working against him and he\u2019s been a great defender of women\u2019s rights and opportunities.\u201d",

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " \u201cYour statement is defamatory, and we demand that you retract it immediately,\u201d an attorney for Gabbard wrote to Clinton, requesting the former secretary of state \u201cimmediately\u201d retract her statements and share a formal retraction on social media. Last month, Clinton made comments about a 2020 candidate who is \u201cthe favorite of the Russians,\u201d who\u00a0was being \u201cgroomed\u201d by the Kremlin as a potential third-party candidate \u2014 widely understood to be a veiled shot at Gabbard. Appearing on a podcast hosted by David Plouffe, President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign manager, the Obama cabinet member\u00a0claimed: [Russia]\u00a0has a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting [Gabbard] so far. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it. Shortly after,\u00a0Gabbard\u00a0\u2014 an Army National Guard\u00a0Major \u2014 slammed Clinton via social media, branding her the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d and accusing her of orchestrating a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0hit piece\u00a0released ahead of\u00a0last month\u2019s\u00a0Democrat presidential debate in Ohio.   Gabbard re-upped her harsh criticism of Clinton in an interview with Breitbart News last week, stating that the foreign policy establishment smears any dissenting voices challenging their conventional policy prescriptions. \u201cThis message and this warning that\u2019s come from Hillary Clinton as well as her proxies and the foreign policy establishment elite in Washington that says if you stand up against them, if you dissent, if you, as I am, are calling for an end to our country\u2019s long-held foreign policy of being the world\u2019s police, toppling dictators in countries we don\u2019t like, if you do that then your character will be smeared, just as they are trying to smear my character and undermine my campaign,\u201d the congresswoman told\u00a0Breitbart News editor-in-chief Alex Marlow on the Breitbart News Daily radio show.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Spicer\u2019s success has sent a shockwave through Hollywood, prompting remarks from elites like Hillary and Chelsea Clinton and the New York Times. Spicer spoke to Breitbart News Sunday in what has now become a pre-DWTS ritual and stressed the significance of the overwhelming support he has seen from conservatives and Breitbart Nation, who have sent a strong message to liberal elites. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m in this position is because of the votes out there,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cPeople you know throughout your viewership, your readership, your listenership that are out there saying, \u2018Hey we want to have fun,\u2019 because that\u2019s what\u2019s carrying me through. It\u2019s certainly not my scores from the judges.\u201d  Ally Brooke, whom Spicer described as a \u201cphenomenal person and dancer\u201d got straight tens from the judges last week yet found herself in the bottom two. Spicer, who garnered the lowest judges\u2019 scores, was safe. That, as Spicer notes, speaks volumes. \u201cAnd yet I have never through nine weeks ever been in the bottom two, and that means if you just look at it mathematically that, somehow, I\u2019m getting such a disproportionate viewer score of the votes that that\u2019s outweighing my lower scores from the judges,\u201d he said. \u201cThat tells you everything.\u201d Spicer\u2019s stay in the show last week sent a shockwave through Hollywood, prompting more than a few angry responses on social media. Twitter erupted with angry replies and inspired hit pieces from the establishment media outlets, including the New York Times. The outlet featured a piece titled \u201cNo, Sean Spicer Really Can\u2019t Dance,\u201d which bizarrely described the former White House official as \u201can untruthful dancer.\u201d \u201cThey literally called my dancing \u2018untruthful,\u2019 which I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Spicer remarked. \u201cIt might be bad, but I don\u2019t know how dancing can tell the truth or lie. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really an attribute you can ascribe to that.\u201d At the end of the day, Spicer believes people \u2013\u00a0not necessarily just conservatives \u2013\u00a0\u201clove the idea of a guy\u201d out there competing and making progress. \u201cI think that upsets some folks,\u201d he said, mentioning the Clintons. \u201cI can\u2019t blame Trump for trying to help Sean Spicer,\u201d the twice-failed presidential candidate said during a bit with James Corden on The Late Late Show. \u201cBut if there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s that these guys really can\u2019t win the popular vote.\u201d \u201cFormer White House spokesman Sean Spicer is now on\u00a0Dancing With the Stars,\u201d Chelsea Clinton added. \u201cIt\u2019s an improvement from his old job, \u2018Dancing around the issues.\u2019\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton literally came out, and Chelsea Clinton as wel,l about how wrong this is. It\u2019s like, wait a second. Are you serious? That \u2013 this what we\u2019re spending our time commenting on?\u201d Spicer said. Spicer also talked about the president\u2019s support, expressing his endless gratitude and pointing out that Trump\u2019s willingness to support him busts another massive left-wing narrative. \u201cI always hear these narratives about President Trump\u2019s not loyal to his folks and whatever. Look \u2013 not that he has to tweet for or against me or anything like that \u2013 but the idea that he knows that I did my best for him, and that he\u2019s willing to go out of his way to continue to show that, it really does mean a lot to me,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cHe\u2019s the president of the United States. He\u2019s the leader of the free world. He\u2019s got a lot going on, but he does care about his people, and he cares about the people who served him and that want him to succeed, and I really do appreciate him taking the time to do that,\u201d he continued. Spicer reminded listeners that his presence on the show has been about \u201cmore than just me. It\u2019s about we,\u201d and mentioned the military charities that his \u201ccampaign\u201d has been supporting throughout the show. The proceeds from his campaign merchandise, found on SpicerArnold.com, go to the Independence Fund, which provides track wheelchairs for veterans with mobility issues as well as the Yellow Ribbon Fund, which supports caregivers of wounded vets. Stakes are high this week, as the competition continues to narrow, increasing the chances of dancers finding themselves in a vulnerable position. Viewer support, however, can be a massive gamechanger, as Spicer can attest. \u201cI could potentially make it into the semifinals of a show that Vegas said I had a 50-1 shot of making it, right? I was the lowest guy by far,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the best dancer and my scores reflect it, but because of the votes I actually have the potential to make it another round, and that just to me is unreal. I mean the idea that that\u2019s happening blows my mind,\u201d he added. Viewers can vote for Spicer up to 20 times Monday night between 8-10 p.m. EST \u2013 ten by texting SEAN to 21523 and ten more times on ABC.com. All information, including the campaign merchandise which supports veterans charities, can be found on Spicer\u2019s\u00a0DWTS\u00a0website,\u00a0SpicerArnold.com.",

She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. And, that\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she\u2019s also a Russian asset. Yeah, she\u2019s a Russian asset. I mean, totally. Clinton did not explicitly mention Gabbard by name, but her spokesman Nick Merill confirmed that Clinton had the Hawaiian lawmaker in mind, telling NBC News, \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d \u201cThe statement is false,\u201d the letter released by Gabbard\u2019s campaign states: Congresswoman Gabbard is not being groomed by Russia to be a third-party candidate. Nor is she a Russian asset. Rather, she is a patriotic loyal American, a sitting four-term United States Congresswoman and a Major in the United States Army National Guard. As such, she is a loyal American who has taken an oath declaring her allegiance to the United States of America both as a soldier and as a member of Congress. She has been serving for over 16 years in the Army National Guard, having voluntarily deployed twice to war zones in the Middle East. The letter also addresses Merrill\u2019s claims that the media \u201cincorrectly quoted\u201d Clinton. He suggested that Clinton meant the Republicans \u2013\u00a0not Russians \u2013\u00a0were \u201cgrooming\u201d Gabbard as a third-party candidate. \u201cBut this makes no sense in light of what you actually said. After you made the statement linking Congresswoman Gabbard to the Russians, you (through your spokesman) doubled down on it with the Russian nesting dolls remark,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThis Republicans-not-Russians spin developed only after you realized the defamatory nature of your statement, and therefore your legal liability, as well as the full extent of the public backlash against your statement,\u201d it continues, describing the \u201cRepublicans-not-Russians spin\u201d as \u201crubbish.\u201d The letter continues: In any event, this strained interpretation bears no legal weight. Defamation claims are not determined by the speaker\u2019s post-hoc rationalizations. They are determined by how the statement was \u201cread and understood by the public . . . .\u201d Here, the public universally understood your statement exactly as you intended to be understood, and exactly as you made it: that Tulsi Gabbard\u2014a sitting Congresswoman, U.S. Army Major, and candidate for President of the United States\u2014is a Russian asset. This is how your statement was understood by those in political circles, such as Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Senator Bernie Sanders, and Andrew Yang. In making the statement, you knew it was false. Congresswoman Gabbard is not a Russian asset and is not being groomed by Russia. Besides your statement, no law enforcement or intelligence agencies have claimed, much less presented any evidence, that Congresswoman Gabbard is a Russian asset. This fabricated story is so facially improbable that it is actionable as defamation. Gabbard\u2019s team is demanding Clinton \u201cimmediately hold a press conference to verbally retract\u2014in full\u2014your comments\u201d and provide a \u201cfull and fair retraction,\u201d ordering Clinton to post on her Twitter account and distribute to major media outlets, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. The retraction is as follows: On October 17, 2019, I made certain statements about Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. Among other things, I accused her of being a Russian asset and that Russia was grooming her to be a third-party presidential candidate. I was wrong. I never should have made these remarks, and I apologize. I did not have any basis for making the statements. I acknowledge my grave mistake and error in judgment in this matter. I support and admire the work that Congresswoman Gabbard has done and will continue to do in serving our country. Gabbard said during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily last week that her clash with Clinton is more than a run-of-the-mill political spat. \u201cThis thing that has rolled out over the last few weeks, I think it\u2019s important to point out that this is not just, \u2018Well, she doesn\u2019t like me or I don\u2019t like her.\u2019 There\u2019s a deeper issue and contrast here, and that issue really is, I think there are two main things here,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cNumber one, what we\u2019ve seen play out is this message and this warning that\u2019s come from Hillary Clinton as well as her proxies and the foreign policy establishment elite in Washington that says if you stand up against them, if you dissent, if you, as I am calling for an end to our country\u2019s long-held foreign policy of being the world\u2019s police, toppling dictators in countries we don\u2019t like, if you do that, then your character will be smeared just as they are trying to smear my character under my campaign,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf you do this, you, too, will be smeared,\u201d she added.",

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Raymond Buckley wrote in a letter to the state\u2019s GOP chairman Stephen Stepanek that he \u201cwanted to thank you for bringing Congressman Chaffetz to New Hampshire,\u201d because Chaffetz in 2016 un-endorsed President Donald Trump. \u201cBringing a former member of Congress who refused to endorse Donald Trump to the state to headline your 2020 Victory Kickoff Fundraiser shows that our two parties have more in common than we thought,\u201d Buckley wrote in the letter to Stepanek, obtained by Breitbart News exclusively ahead of its public release. Letter to Chairman Stepanek by Breitbart News on Scribd  The fact that Democrats are exploiting the Never Trump history of certain Republicans\u2014Chaffetz was, like many Republicans in the lead-up to the 2016 election, hesitant to endorsee the president\u2014is a new and sophisticated strategy of leveraging the establishment GOP and Never Trump movement to divide Republicans and create dissent in the ranks ahead of 2020. Buckley continues in his letter by stating that New Hampshire Democrats \u201cagree\u201d with Chaffetz in comments he made in 2016 in the wake of the Access Hollywood tape\u2019s release withdrawing his endorsement of then-candidate now-President Trump. \u201cWe here at the New Hampshire Democratic Party agree with Chaffetz that no one \u2018in good conscience\u2019 could endorse Donald Trump for president,\u201d Buckley wrote. The letter cites a Politico article writing up a Chaffetz interview with a local news outlet in October 2016, where he said of Trump after the tape\u2019s release: \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d \u201cI can no longer in good conscience endorse this person for president. It is some of the most abhorrent and offensive comments that you can possibly imagine,\u201d Chaffetz said in the interview with local Utah television channel Fox 13 News. Buckley\u2019s letter to Stepanek continues by stating that New Hampshire Democrats and voters at large agree with Chaffetz\u2019s comments later in October 2016, according to a CNN article cited, that he would not put his \u201cgood name and reputation and my family\u201d behind Trump for president in 2016. \u201cThe majority of Democrats and the majority of Granite Staters also agree with Chaffetz when he said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to put my good name and reputation and my family behind Donald Trump when he acts like this. I just can\u2019t do it,\u2019\u201d Buckley wrote, citing Chaffetz from 2016. The CNN article, however, did include a tweet from Chaffetz days before the 2016 election saying he would in fact vote for Trump because of how bad his Democrat rival Hillary Rodham Clinton was\u2013even though it pained him to vote for Trump.  \u201cThank you again for bringing this anti-Trump surrogate to the state,\u201d Buckley\u2019s letter to Stepanek concludes. \u201cWe appreciate all you are doing to defeat Donald Trump in 2020.\u201d Chaffetz represented Utah\u2019s third congressional district for many years. Toward the end of his career, he was the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, before he stepped down from Congress in the summer of 2017. His seat was later filled by now-Rep. John Curtis (R-UT) in a special election. Chaffetz did end up coming around on Trump and was supportive of the president in his last weeks in office. He has since become a Fox News contributor. While a handful of 2016-era Never Trumpers remain openly opposed to the president, most have either come around and backed him or receded from politics altogether. However, some Republicans who made Never Trump-aligned comments have attempted comebacks across the country and attempted to reform their relationships with the president and his supporters\u2014but Democrats re-airing their critical comments may threaten those efforts. Trump himself called the few Never Trumpers who remain actively opposed to him \u201cdangerous\u201d during an exclusive Oval Office interview with Breitbart News earlier this year. \u201cThe Never Trumpers, that\u2019s an amazing breed. First of all, they\u2019re on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation now,\u201d Trump said in the exclusive Oval Office interview with Breitbart News back in March. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many of them left. But they\u2019re still slightly dangerous.\u201d",

Taylor\u2019s information came from one of Taylor\u2019s staffers who claimed he overheard the president\u2019s phone call with Sondland. The New Jersey Democrat chastised Taylor over his assertion. \u201cIt\u2019s hearsay,\u201d Van Drew said after Wednesday\u2019s impeachment inquiry hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult dealing with this because it\u2019s he said-she said.\u201d Reps. Van Drew and Collin Peterson (D-MN) were the two House Democrats to vote against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA) resolution formalizing the rules and proceedings regarding their impeachment inquiry. Van Drew said he would need to see the stronger evidence such as verifiable documents or audio of President Trump\u2019s conversations to prove the allegations levied against him for him to back impeachment. \u201cFrankly the aid did flow, so that really isn\u2019t an issue at the end of the day,\u201d Van Drew added. \u201cThe aid flowed, and everything resolved.\u201d Van Drew\u2019s district represents one of the many districts that Democrats flipped during the 2018 midterm elections. President Trump and Republicans hope to flip red during the 2020 congressional elections. President Trump defeated Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election in New Jersey\u2019s second congressional district. Other Democrats have continued to criticize the impeachment inquiry into President Trump as \u201chopelessly partisan.\u201d Rep. Collin Peterson (D-MN) said in October his constituents said this move to impeach the president has fractured the nation. \u201cI have been hearing from my constituents on both sides of this matter for months, and the escalation of calls this past week just shows me how divided our country really is right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout support from Senate Republicans, going down this path is a mistake. Today\u2019s vote is both unnecessary, and widely misrepresented in the media and by Republicans as a vote on impeachment. I will not make a decision on impeachment until all the facts have been presented,\u201d Van Drew added. In contrast to Peterson, Rep. Jarden Golden (D-ME), another freshman Democrat, claimed recently Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry will not pull \u201cthe country apart.\u201d Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

      "content": " Speaking at King\u2019s College London, Hillary Clinton chimed in on UK politics again, claiming that female MPs who have quit after receiving online abuse from \u201chatemongers on the left or right\u201d could lead Britain down an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d path. \u201cWhen I heard about all these people, particularly the women, who weren\u2019t going to run again [as MPs], and they attributed it\u00a0to the threats they are going to face, that is not only a threat to individuals, that is a threat to democracies. If people are intimidated out of running for office in a democracy because of these hatemongers on the left or the right . . . that is the path [to] authoritarianism, that is the path [to] fascism\u201d she said in comments reported by The Times. Clinton and her daughter Chelsea, are currently in London promoting their new co-authored book \u2013\u00a0The Book Of Gutsy Women: Favourite Stories Of Courage And Resilience. The failed presidential candidate has herself long been accused of threatening women, particularly from those women who have made claims of sexual assault against her husband, former president Bill Clinton. In 2016, Dolly Kyle, the author of Hillary: The Other Woman, told\u00a0Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125, that Hillary Clinton \u201cuses lies, threats, intimidation, violence \u2014 whatever it takes to achieve her political ends.\u201d She went on to say that Mrs Clinton was a \u201clying hypocrite\u201d and that she \u201chas attacked every woman Billy\u2019s had any kind of sex with!\u201d  This is the second time in a week that Clinton has publicly stepped in and commented on British politics. On Tuesday Clinton came under fire for \u2018interfering\u2019 in the upcoming general election in the United Kingdom. Breitbart News reported that Mrs Clinton took to British airwaves and told BBC Radio 5 Live that she was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d that the Boris Johnson government would not be releasing a report on meddling from the Russian government during the 2016 EU referendum. \u201cI\u2019m dumbfounded that this government won\u2019t release the report \u2026 because every person who votes in this country deserves to see that report before your election happens,\u201d Clinton said. The UK government has\u00a0said\u00a0that it needs more time to review the report before releasing it to the public, in order to prevent the release of sensitive national security information. Mrs Clinton also said yesterday that the pro-sovereignty Brexit movement was a symptom of \u201cthe very real problems and disagreements that our democracies have.\u201d ",

Full stop,\u201d Clinton said:  Yovanovitch was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee as part of its impeachment inquiry even though the former diplomat was dismissed by the president many weeks before the July 25 phone call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky that launched the Democrat\u2019s partisan effort. She would have been unaware of Trump\u2019s tweet, but Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) read it to her during the hearing, which said, in part: Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President\u2019s absolute right to appoint ambassadors\u2026..They call it \u201cserving at the pleasure of the President.\u201d The U.S. now has a very strong and powerful foreign policy, much different than proceeding administrations. It is called, quite simply, America First! With all of that, however, I have done FAR more for Ukraine than O. \u201cAmbassador Yovanovitch, as we sit here testifying the president is attacking you on Twitter, and I\u2019d like to give you the chance to respond,\u201d Schiff said during the hearing, reading off Trump\u2019s tweets. Trump\u2019s enemies, including Democrats like Clinton, quickly took hold of the witness intimidation talking point even though Yovanovitch is not a witness in a criminal proceeding and freely expressed her opinion throughout her time in front of the committee, including criticizing the president.

      "author": "Linda Tripp",
      "content": " The world has watched this encore performance, likely with the requisite shock and awe. And, a painful experience it has been. This extravaganza performing live on air in the House of Representatives is truly one for the books. They should have skipped the Ringmaster and the trained monkeys and stuck, instead, to legislating, something I recall former Congresses actually attempting to do. I\u2019m referring, of course, to the Schiff Show in the House Intelligence Committee.\u00a0 Adam Schiff\u2019s long-awaited day in the sun. His moment to shine. You will recall Adam Schiff.\u00a0 Currently dual hatted as Ringmaster and Chief Clown, he was the one who went on record early on claiming he had seen evidence of President Trump\u2019s purported collusion with Vladimir Putin and promising that, with patience, we would see it too. He has everything riding on the Impeachment Hoax, his fervent hope that if he couldn\u2019t get Trump on collusion, he can get him on this latest fantasy. Finally. Veracity is optional in Adam Schiff\u2019s world and morphs much like an amoeba, taking on the shape of whatever he needs it to be. Stupendously farcical, this Schiff\u00a0 Show is somehow made even worse by the downright maniacal look in his eyes as he sits upon his throne wielding his gavel.\u00a0 Silencing Republicans. Orchestrating the actions of an imbedded political operative masquerading as a whistleblower. Operating in secrecy. Because he can. Ah, the long awaited power. It\u2019s gone to his head. And it is startlingly evident in the unmistakable glean of lunacy in those remarkable eyes as they rapidly dart around the room. You can\u2019t miss it. Creepy. Worse, scary. For most of us, this kangaroo court in painful to watch. At best, it\u2019s nothing more than political theater dressed up as constitutional duty.\u00a0 Lipstick on a pig. At worst, it\u2019s not that innocent. It\u2019s ominously akin to a present day Salem Witch Trial with the suppressed minority victimized just as much as the target, where due process in nothing more than an abstract concept.\u00a0 We see it. We know it. And we can turn it off. Walk away. Christmas shop. And think about it later. Not so for this President.\u00a0 He does not have that luxury. It is his life. The life of his family.\u00a0 It has become his reality. And the latest assault of the Resistance can\u2019t help but impede his effectiveness to govern. And that is the point. From the day he took office, everything that led up to this moment would have crippled a lesser man. I often think about his family. His youngest son. His grandchildren. He left a successful and dare I say fulfilling life of comfort by any measurable standard to take on this thankless job. He left the helm of an empire that surely needed him, and he did so without a backward glance. I\u2019ve never wondered why. I believe it was and is a deep seated patriotism and love of country. He is giving back to a country that afforded him such financial success and was willing to put it all on the line to fix what he saw as broken. Unlike so many others, his run for the highest office in the land was not then, nor will it ever be, motivated by self-enrichment. That much should be clear. He has upset the well-oiled components of those who make up the swamp, the murky business of Washington as a whole, and that is his unpardonable sin. Hillary Clinton had it half right when she claimed they were \u201cdead broke\u201d when they left office.\u00a0 She just accidentally on purpose mixed up the timeframe. In actuality. they were dead broke when they arrived at the White House in 1993.\u00a0 They began fleecing the public upon arrival and never stopped dipping their hands in the till. They left multimillionaires, spent the ensuing years diligently padding their coffers, and never looked back.\u00a0 The Obamas did rather well, too, arriving with little, multimillionaires today. Their presidencies resulted in riches behind their wildest dreams. Think about that. Then there is President trump. Does anyone ever wonder how he does it?\u00a0 How despite the relentless attacks ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime, the President gets up every morning and gives his all, and has since day one, very close to three years ago? There is just so much a person can take. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) speaks during a hearing with witness U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch before the House Intelligence Committee in the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill. (Joshua Roberts \u2013 Pool/Getty Images) But Donald Trump is not your average person.\u00a0 Without ever missing a beat, and under the most extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances to ever face a peacetime president, he works for us.\u00a0 And what a job he\u2019s done. It\u2019s more remarkable that he has achieved such across the board success, considering he has had both hands tied behind his back.\u00a0 It is left for us to imagine what he could have accomplished with just a little bipartisan support, a little less sabotage, on Capitol Hill. That he has to fail so the resistors can win is a loss to us all. The onslaught of media and partisan hatred has never ceased.\u00a0 It has been relentless. Yet, he has been able to compartmentalize, to reduce to so much white noise everything from the Russian Collusion Hoax to the daily debacle that followed as he boldly forged forward. But make no mistake. President Trump is not a peacetime president.\u00a0 He is, for all intents and purposes, a President under siege.\u00a0 A defacto wartime President, he is the sole enemy of a significant portion of the elected and non-elected government officials of his own country. With the eager complicity of what used to be called the mainstream media, they have controlled the dialogue since Inauguration Day.\u00a0 They have had one goal. They want him out at all costs. Their quest is seen as righteous, his presidency illegitimate. In their arrogance, they\u2019ve forgotten who gets to make that determination. The impeachment proceedings have been in the works since the day this man committed the unforgiveable crime of first being elected and then being sworn into office.\u00a0 For that, he had to be punished. Tarring and feathering is no longer in vogue. Local Gulags unavailable. Impeachment became the next best thing, Having worked for two Presidents in the rarified air of the Oval Office corridor, I know first-hand the relentless pressure faced by a sitting President. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart. But this? It makes the experience of his predecessors look like child\u2019s play. Because each had the luxury, more or less, of a status quo in Washington that allowed them to govern. Not so for this President. Not for one single minute. In the face of his intestinal fortitude, the likes of which I have personally never seen, I\u2019ve begun to think of him as someone with special powers. Because who else could survive all this?\u00a0 Anyone else would have been flattened by now. In his seeming capacity for unending valor in the face of nonstop virulent attacks, he reminds me of a figure from my long-ago childhood. A latter-day man of steel, the original caped Superman taking on the demons of Metropolis, even in the face of the deadly Kryptonite. It\u2019s not such a stretch, at least metaphorically. Of course, he is a mere mortal. The super powers all an illusion. All except one. An important one. One he should never forget. It is the dogged commitment of his millions upon millions of supporters across our great country, a number growing exponentially as even Democrats recognize the sabotage as this farce marches on, as we watch Trump Derangement Syndrome overtake our government. We are his strength. And in the end, his one real super power. As this farce fumbles on, my money is on President Trump.\u00a0 The kryptonite that is the Capitol Hill cabal does not understand with whom they are dealing when it comes to this President and worse, they are clueless when it comes to the electorate. They trivialized both before, they are doing so again. So, they proceed at their own peril. And they don\u2019t stand a chance.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The Clinton Foundation\u2019s revenue has nosedived following Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss to then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016. According to its recently released public report, the organization took in just $30.7 million in 2018 \u2013 over seven million less than the\u00a0$38.4 million it reported in 2017 and roughly $218 million less than the $249 million the charity raised in 2009, when Clinton served as the secretary of state in the Obama administration. The charity spent millions more than it took in last year, spending\u00a0$47.5 million on \u201cpayroll, grants and promotion, among other items,\u201d according to Open Secrets. \u201cIt also scaled back spending on domestic grants and foreign activities compared to the prior year, but spent more in 2018 on advertising, promotions and fundraising efforts,\u201d Open Secrets added. Overall, the charity\u2019s 2018 revenue\u00a0is \u201cless than half the $62.9 million it raised in 2016 as Clinton was at the height of her presidential campaign,\u201d according to Open Secrets: Each of the two years since Clinton\u2019s loss in the 2016 election has seen the organization\u2019s revenue drop to record lows, raising less than any fiscal year in more than a decade \u2014 a sharp contrast to the $249 million raised during Clinton\u2019s first year as secretary of state.\u00a0The foundation received less money from fundraising events and its service programs last year compared to previous years but kept investing tens of millions in the programs. Accompanying the charity\u2019s massive revenue loss is a significant reduction in speaking fees, going from $3.6 million in 2014 to $369,899 in 2018. However, that is $71,923 more than the $297,976 it reported from paid speeches the year prior. Clinton has been on defense for her foundation, blasting out an email in January in an attempt to vaguely defend the \u201cfalse accusations\u201d and \u201cbaseless assaults\u201d against the charity. The email read in part: I am so proud of the impact the Clinton Foundation has made. When I ran for president, this top-rated global charity was dragged into a political mud fight. In the two years since, people with an axe to grind have continued to try to undermine its work by attacking them and making false accusations. But the Foundation has continued to help people across America and around the world, undeterred by these baseless assaults. I\u2019m inspired by this steadfast dedication to improve lives. There are real issues in society needing attention that the people of the Clinton Foundation work hard to solve every day. Despite the attacks, they are staying focused on what really matters. \u201cJoin with me in resisting the vitriol. Sign up today and get involved in work that matters,\u201d Clinton added. As Breitbart News reported, the Clinton Foundation has faced controversy \u201cover its acceptance of multi-million dollar contributions from foreign governments while Clinton was Secretary of State, including donations from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar\u201d: One point of\u00a0contention\u00a0revolved around $2.35 million donated to the Clinton Foundation by the family foundation of the chairman of Uranium One, the firm in which the Russian state-owned Rosatom company took a majority stake in a deal approved by Clinton\u2019s State Department. Open Secrets noted that over one-third of the organization\u2019s 2018 donations,\u00a0$11.9 million, came from just nine donors.",

I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing,\u2019 something to that effect.\u201d  Clinton stated last month that it is going to be \u201cvery, very hard\u201d to beat Trump in 2020 if the economy \u201cstays in good shape\u201d and he is not impeached. She stated: We have a number of very able, very admirable candidates who are vying for the nomination, but at the end of the day, there are a lot of forecasters who are saying, \u2018Look, if the economy stays in good shape and he\u2019s not impeached, or he\u2019s impeached but not convicted, it\u2019s going to be very, very hard,\u2019 because of all of the advantages that he will have on the stuff we were just talking about like suppression and everything else.

Jim Himes (D-CT) questioned Hill about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, suggesting that it was a \u201cfictional narrative.\u201d \u201cDr. Hill\u2026you characterized the idea that Ukraine interfered in the election as a fictional narrative. Have you seen any evidence at all that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election?\u201d he said. Hill then produced two articles she was presented with during her closed-door deposition. One article was an\u00a0op-ed in The Hill\u00a0by then-Ukraine Ambassador to the U.S. Valeriy Chaly in August 2016, which was critical of then-candidate Donald Trump. Rep. Himes interrupted her, read from the op-ed and asked her rhetorically, \u201cDoes that sound like election interference to you?\u201d She responded, \u201cWell, I would say it\u2019s probably not the most advisable thing to do for an ambassador because you never know who is going to win,\u201d she said. The other article she brought up was a Politico piece by journalist Kenneth Vogel that outlined efforts by a Democratic National Committee contractor Alexandra Chalupa to work with Ukrainian officials to distribute dirt on the Trump campaign. \u201cKenneth Vogel is a very well-known, and as you pointed out, extremely good journalist,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it is extraordinarily important and gets to the issue here.\u201d \u201cMr. Vogel points out that the Ukrainian government, again, they wouldn\u2019t have done very well at the bookies\u2026they bet on the wrong horse \u2014 they bet on Hillary Clinton winning the election. And so, you know, they were trying to curry favor with the Clinton campaign \u2014 it\u2019s quite evident here,\u201d she continued. Hill cited several Ukrainian officials in the article who were trying to collect information on Trump\u2019s then-campaign manager Paul Manafort \u201cand other people as well.\u201d Fiona Hill says then-Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Valeriy Chaly wrote an \"ill-advised\" op-ed bashing Trump in the run-up to the 2016 election.

Clinton, former First Lady Clinton was going to win. Many said some pretty disparaging and hurtful things about him, and I can\u2019t fault him for feeling aggrieved about them,\u201d she added.

      "content": " On Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d Government Accountability Institute president Peter Schweizer said the Clinton Foundation was experiencing a sharp drop in donations for the third year following Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat in the 2016 presidential election. Schweizer said, \u201cThis the past year, the Clinton Foundation literally raised 10%\u00a0of what it did in 2009, the\u00a0first year that Hillary was secretary of state, and the international numbers were even\u00a0worse. They had all this money flowing\u00a0in when Hillary was the chief\u00a0diplomat of the United States. Curiously in light of the\u00a0testimony, the number one country\u00a0for giving money to the Clinton Foundation was not Great Britain. It was not France. It was not Japan,\u00a0it was Ukraine. All that money has now dried up, literally. The Clinton Foundation has had a hard time raising money because they don\u2019t have the influence to sell. They don\u2019t have power access to sell, and that, I think, is the primary evidence for what the Clinton enterprise was all about.\u201d He added, \u201cOne of the most\u00a0interesting things that came out\u00a0of the Podesta\u2019s emails a few years ago, was an internal review that The Clinton Foundation data,\u00a0actually at Chelsea\u2019s behest they hired\u00a0Simpson Thacher the law firm to\u00a0sort of look at The Clinton Foundation. And what they found\u00a0is, high dollar donators had\u00a0expectations of what? They had expectations of quid pro quos. That is the word of Simpson Thacher in their internal review. So you are quite right, with all the\u00a0discussions in Washington and\u00a0the impeachment hearings, it\u2019s\u00a0remarkable to me that there is\u00a0no interest in The Clinton Foundation. Just consider the testimony of Gordon Sondland and this whole issue of a meeting in the White House between the Ukrainian\u00a0president and Donald Trump, which some have alleged was linked to them announcing\u00a0these investigations. That\u2019s a classic example of access.\u00a0The Clinton\u2019s did that every day when she\u00a0was secretary of state.\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

      "content": " Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) began his questioning of Hill by repeating her earlier testimony that the idea that Ukraine interfered in the election is a \u201cfictional narrative.\u201d \u201cI brought with me two exhibits that I was pointed to by your colleagues during the deposition that I gave on Oct. 14,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful they pointed me in this direction.\u201d One of those \u201cexhibits\u201d was an op-ed written by then-Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States Valeriy Chaly and published in The Hill newspaper. \u201cSo this is during the presidential campaign when President Trump was then the nominee for the Republican Party,\u201d Hill said, adding the Chaly was \u201ccritical of President Trump.\u201d Himes tried to justify that criticism by saying the Trump had made negative comments about Crimea. \u201cTo be honest the whole article is actually about Ukraine and this is a classic standard for anyone who wants to write an op-ed,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI\u2019ve written plenty myself \u2014 you pick a peg and proceed to say what you want to say.\u201d Himes continued to criticize Trump and then asked if Hill thought the editorial represented interfering with the election as Trump has claimed. \u201cI would say that it\u2019s probably not the most advisable thing to do for an ambassador because you never know who\u2019s going to win,\u201d Hill said. Hill then cited the second article she was shown, one written by journalist Kenneth Vogel in 2017. \u201cMr. Vogel points out that the Ukrainian government, again, you know, they wouldn\u2019t have done very well at the bookies picking up the issue I pointed out in the beginning of today,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThey bet on the wrong horse.\u201d \u201cThey bet on Hillary Clinton winning the election,\u201d Hill said. \u201cAnd so, you know, they were trying to curry favor with the Clinton campaign.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s quite evident here,\u201d Hill claimed, adding that even though Ukraine did make an effort to get information about the Trump campaign, including about former campaign manager Paul Manafort, it didn\u2019t represent a \u201ctop-down effort\u201d such as was the case in Russian election meddling. \u201cI also mentioned in my deposit of October 14th that, in fact, many officials from many countries, including Ukraine, bet on the wrong horse,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThey believed that Secretary Clinton, former Senator Clinton, former first lady Clinton, was going to win and many said some pretty disparaging and hurtful things about President Trump.\u201d \u201cAnd I can\u2019t blame him for feeling aggrieved about them,\u201d Hill said, adding that she would \u201ctake offense at some of the things that were said if I was the president.\u201d Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

      "author": "Charlie Spiering",
      "content": " Hill spoke about the 2016 election under questioning from Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX) during Thursday\u2019s impeachment hearings in the House Intelligence Committee. He asked: The loser in the 2016 election, for three years, has continued to argue that because she won the popular vote, that somehow the election was inappropriate and we shouldn\u2019t trust it; that the electoral college victory, which was resounding, shouldn\u2019t be trusted. Does that help Putin or play into the narrative that he would like for us to do, that our elections are somehow rigged and shouldn\u2019t be trusted? \u201cYes it does,\u201d Hill agreed. In September, Clinton blamed a long list of things for her loss to President Trump, complaining about the electoral college, Russia hacking, fake news, the media, propaganda, voter suppression, and racist and white supremacist websites. Hill also agreed with Conaway about Putin pushing anti-fracking propaganda on RT, the Russia propaganda media outlet in the United States. She recalled that she attended a meeting with Putin and other Americans in 2011, where the Russian president was adamant about the dangers of fracking while speaking. \u201cHe started in 2011 making it very clear that he saw American fracking as a great threat to Russian interests, we were all struck at how much he stressed this issue,\u201d she said.",

      "subtitle": "Democrats have argued for the past three years that the investigation into then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s potential ties to Russia was not only legal, but also necessary as a matter of national security.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " \u201cIf a foreign power possessed compromising information on a U.S. government official in a position of influence, that is a counterintelligence risk. If a foreign power possessed leverage, or the perception of it, over the president, that is a counterintelligence nightmare,\u201d House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff wrote in a\u00a0Washington Post op-ed in April. The same exact logic applies to Joe Biden. The fact that his son, Hunter Biden, was appointed to a lucrative board position at Burisma in 2014 while he himself was overseeing the Obama administration\u2019s policy toward Ukraine created a conflict of interest so problematic that Obama administration officials had to brief\u00a0Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch about it before her Senate confirmation hearing in 2016. (They did nothing to resolve it.) It seems Hunter Biden made a habit of enriching himself by exploiting his father\u2019s position. Even if Vice President Biden did the right thing in 2016 by demanding Ukraine fire an allegedly corrupt prosecutor, on pain of losing $1 billion in U.S. aid, and even if the investigation into Burisma was dormant at the time, he ought to have recused himself. Worse, Joe Biden has given confusing answers about whether he knew of his son\u2019s business activities. We do not yet know the truth about the Bidens \u2014 and, worse, we do not know what Ukraine knows (or China, where Hunter Biden also pursued business opportunities allegedly opened up by his father\u2019s political position). As Democrats have argued in the past, it would be a \u201ccounterintelligence nightmare\u201d if a \u201cforeign power\u201d had \u201ccompromising information\u201d or \u201cleverage\u201d over a president. We ought to know about that before Biden takes office. The same logic Democrats applied to investigating Trump\u2019s (imaginary) Russia ties justifies the investigation into Biden\u2019s (real) Ukraine links. When President Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July to investigate the circumstances in which then-Vice President Joe Biden forced out the prosecutor \u2014 and his demand was limited to that \u2014 he was acting on what Democrats themselves have described often as an urgent national security interest. And unlike the Obama administration, which may have misled a FISA court to obtain surveillance warrants, Trump made the request lawfully, referring Zelensky to the Attorney General. There is a clear dilemma in both the Trump-Russia investigation and the Biden-Ukraine investigation: it is hard to separate the public interest from political motives, especially in an election year. Likewise with the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s misuse of a private email server, which was marred by politics. Some of the FBI and CIA officials who investigated Trump, like Peter Strzok, clearly had partisan designs. But some appear to have believed, sincerely, they were acting in the best interest of the country. The inherent risk of partisanship in an election-year investigation is a puzzle that requires a legislative solution. Perhaps Congress could create a separate office in the Department of Justice, overseen by a bipartisan panel of legislators, to handle such sensitive investigations in future in a way that screens politics out of the process. But because Democrats believed so fervently in the Russia collusion hoax, they refused to see the potential abuses of power in the investigation. Now they will impeach Trump for doing what they said the government ought to do. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "author": "Amy Furr",
      "content": " Nick Umbs, who is a member of a small group called the President Trump Fan Club, cares for sections of highway on Ox Road and Burke Lake Road, Fox 5 reported. Even though the fan club has only a few members, Umbs said he wanted to do something positive for President Trump. He commented: I thought it would be kind of a neat idea to do something kind of in support because all of this publicity that we see is always negative, negative, negative. And I wanted to show that there are people out there who are supportive of the president who are doing good and good for the community. Twice this year, Umbs and his girlfriend, who is also a member of the fan club, have picked up trash along the highways where the signs stand, bearing the president\u2019s name. Umbs told\u00a0the Washingtonian that he enjoyed tidying up the two-and-a-half-mile stretch of roads, even though \u201cit\u2019s a pretty liberal area.\u201d \u201cNo matter what side of the aisle people are on they thank us, they roll down the window and give us a thumbs up, honk their horn,\u201d he said. When asked what he will do if Trump does not win a second term, Umbs stated, \u201cThat is a really good question! I guess I would just keep cleaning it up. I think the permits are good for three years.\u00a0I don\u2019t think my support\u2019s going to change.\u201d In 2016, Fairfax County gave President Trump just a little more than 28 percent of the vote, whereas Hillary Clinton got 64 percent, according to Fox News. However, that fact has not caused the young man to question his support for the president. \u201cI really like President Trump,\u201d Umbs said. \u201cI really feel like he follows through with what he says, and number one that he absolutely loves the country \u2026 and if I have to clean up trash to show my support, I\u2019m willing to do that.\u201d",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Clinton has not hidden her opinion throughout the seven public impeachment hearings that the House Intelligence Committee has held over the course of the last two weeks. She wrapped up the week with some final thoughts, declaring that Trump \u201ccommitted an impeachable offense.\u201d \u201cThe question is not whether Trump has committed impeachable crimes. He has,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe question is whether Republicans in Congress will affirm that an American president is not above the law\u201d:  Despite Clinton\u2019s assertion, none of the witnesses over the last two weeks were able to definitively show that the president committed an impeachable offense. While the vast majority of witnesses were testifying based on hearsay, Democrats overwhelmingly declared victory after Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who spoke to the president, muttered the words \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d However, when pressed, Sondland said it was his presumption that a phone call, meeting, and aid were contingent upon an investigation into the 2016 election and Burisma and stated that Trump explicitly told him, \u201cI want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.\u201d Sondland said: I finally called the president \u2026 I believe I just asked him an open-ended question, Mr. Chairman. What do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these different ideas and theories and this and that. What do you want? It was a very short abrupt conversation, he was not in a good mood, and he just said, \u201cI want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing,\u201d something to that effect. He \u201cnever told me directly that the aid was conditioned,\u201d Sondland said, telling Democrat counsel Daniel Goldman that no one told him aid was tied to anything. \u201cI was presuming it was,\u201d he said.  Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) emphasized that point during the hearing: On page 14 you said this: Was there a quid pro quo \u2013 today\u2019s, your opening statement \u2013 as I testified previously with regard to requested White House call, White House meeting is yes that there needed to be a public statement from President Zelensky. When the chairman asked you about the security assistance dollars you said there needed to be a public announcement from Zelensky, so I\u2019m asking you a simple question. When did that happen? \u201cIt never did,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cThey got the call July 25. The got the meeting \u2013 not in the White House but in New York \u2013 on September 25. They got the money on September 11,\u201d Jordan continued: I mean, you got all three of them wrong. They get the call, they get the meeting, they get the money. It\u2019s not 2+2. It\u2019s 0-3. I mean I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. And you told Mr. Castor that the president never told you that the announcement had to happen to get anything. In fact. He didn\u2019t just not tell you that, he explicitly said the opposite. The gentlemen from Texas just read it. You said to the President of the United States, \u201cWhat do you want from Ukraine?\u201d The President: \u201cI want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelenksy to do the right thing. I want him to so what he ran on. This is far from the first time Clinton has remarked on the impeachment inquiry\u2019s developments. Last week, she accused Trump of engaging in \u201cwitness intimidation\u201d after the president tweeted about\u00a0former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during her testimony \u2013 something she would not have known if House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) refrained from reading the tweets aloud during the hearing:  On Wednesday, Clinton praised the individuals who worked to win a House majority for Democrats, because that ultimately made the impeachment hearings possible:  White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News\u2019s The Story on Thursday that, even though the president does not believe the House has a basis to move forward with impeachment, he would invite a trial in the Senate in hopes of calling witnesses such as Schiff, the so-called \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d and the Bidens. \u201cAnd he says, if the House moves forward with this sham, and they continue to push these fake, illegitimate proceedings onto the American people, then he wants it to go to the Senate, and he wants a trial,\u201d Gidley said.",

The 81-year-old leftist also went after Barack Obama over his comments last week in which he warned Democratic presidential candidates against pursuing the political \u201cpurity tests\u201d pushed by the far-left activist wing of the party. \u201cI do not agree with Obama that this is not a time for bold ideas,\u201d Fonda said. \u201cI think this is exactly the time that people need to be brave and offer bold ideas. \u2026 Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t have an answer for the people that are so hurting in the middle of the country. Donald Trump, you know, whatever we think of him, he had bold ideas.\u201d Calling out Hillary Clinton\u2019s near complete absence from the heartland in the run up to the 2016 election, Fonda said \u201cI was all over the middle of the country before the election, and there was no noise from Hillary.
