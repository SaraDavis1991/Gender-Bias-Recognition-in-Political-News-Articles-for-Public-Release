      "content": " While some of the nation\u2019s most conservative lawmakers have made last-minute decisions to back out of next week\u2019s National Tea Party Convention in Nashville, the headliner is still planning to pick up her check. Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin told Fox News on Thursday evening that, unlike Reps. Michelle Bachmann (R-Minn) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), she still intends to speak at the convention, despite the growing controversy over the obscure for-profit entity running the event. \u201cOh, you betcha I\u2019m going to be there,\u201d Palin told Greta Van Susteren. \u201cI\u2019m going to speak there because there are people traveling from many miles away to hear what that tea party movement is all about and what that message is that should be received by our politicians in Washington. I\u2019m honored to get to be there.\u201d Palin is getting $100,000 to deliver the keynote address at the conference. The 2008 vice presidential candidate insisted that her fee will \u201cgo right back into the cause\u201d in the form of donations \u201cto people and to events, those things that I believe in that will help perpetuate the message, the message being, Government, you have constitutional limits. You better start abiding by them.\u201d Asked by Van Susteren whether she thinks the Republican Party would be best served by merging with the tea party movement, Palin replied with an enthusiastic endorsement of the idea. \u201cThey need to merge,\u201d she said. \u201cDefinitely, they need to merge. I think those who are wanting the divisions and the divisiveness and the controversy \u2014 those are the ones who don\u2019t believe in the message. And they\u2019re the ones, I think, stirring it up. We need to ignore that and we need to forge ahead with a cohesive message. It\u2019s a common sense message. It, again, is, Government, limit yourself so that the private sector, our families, free individuals can grow and thrive and prosper and enjoy America\u2019s freedom!\u201d WATCH Palin on Fox. Her Tea-Party comments start around the four-minute mark: Watch the latest news video at <a href=\u201dhttp://video.foxnews.com/\u201c>video.foxnews.com</a>",

The former Alaska governor told Sean Hannity, in a taping of the conservative firebrand\u2019s radio program on Wednesday, that she was \u201cnot gonna back off\u201d the criticism that the health care bill would pursue cost saving measures by rationing end of life care. \u201cIf the health care bill goes the way Obama wants it, we\u2019re gonna have something very much like foreign countries\u2019 systems of health care like the British, and it\u2019s the American people \u2014 if we have our health care paid for by the bureaucracy, by government \u2014 depending on our health condition, depending on our age \u2014 we\u2019re gonna be subject to bureaucrats deciding, panels and commissions deciding \u2014 just like they do overseas \u2014 who will be worthy of receiving the health care that government is going to provide.\u201d \u201cSo that is the death panel that I referred to, and I won\u2019t back off on criticizing that aspect of the health care bill.\u201d COMMENTS COME ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES IN: The remarks come roughly two weeks after Palin took to her Facebook page to re-assert the validity of the much-criticized (and thoroughly debunked) death panel. That entry from the former vice presidential candidate, in turn, was in response to PolitiFact.com post that dubbed the argument the \u201clie of the year.\u201d Palin scoffed at that critique. But there was one hitch to her re-assertion. She changed the definition about what actually constituted the death panel. In her first go-around, the former governor referenced end-of-life counseling in the health care legislation. In the post-Politifact Facebook entry she insisted that the death panel was coming in the form of a Medicare Advisory Board \u2014 a panel that a large number of well-respected economist have deemed important to rein in costs in Medicare (not, say, cut the plug on granny).

      "content": " Opponents to immigration reform have embraced a new talking point. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin joined the debate over the Senate-approved comprehensive immigration reform bill this weekend, saying in a Coulter-esque statement posted to Facebook that a vote for the \u201camnesty bill\u201d insults Latinos. \u201cYou\u2019ve just abandoned the Reagan Democrats with this amnesty bill,\u201d Palin\u2019s statement reads, adding: \u201cYou disrespect Hispanics with your assumption that they desire ignoring the rule of Law.\u201d Anyone familiar with polling of Latino voters knows this statement is inaccurate. Polls routinely find that an overwhelming majority of Hispanic voters support offering a pathway to citizenship to the undocumented. A Fox News Latino poll released in March of last year found some 85 percent of Latino voters favored a pathway to citizenship, while a Wall Street Journal-NBC poll from April put the figure at 82 percent. In the words of Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post\u2019s Face Checker blog, \u201ca core part of Palin\u2019s assumply is just simply wrong.\u201d But that hasn\u2019t stopped others from tossing the idea into the news cycle. During an appearance on CNN last week, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) slammed Democrats for \u201cplaying the race card\u201d on immigration, saying that \u201ca whole lot of Hispanics\u201d in his state preferred ramping up border security to passing a reform with a pathway to citizenship. \u201cI will tell you as the son of a Cuban immigrant, as someone who received over 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in the state of Texas, I think it is condescending to go to Hispanics and say \u2018we\u2019re going to buy your vote with amnesty,\u2019\u201d Cruz said. As conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin points out, no poll actually shows that Cruz ever won 40 percent of the Hispanic vote. She continues: Cruz and others opposed to citizenship for illegal immigrants are trying to convince fellow Republicans that they will do fine with Hispanics by voting against immigration reform. There is a mound of data from polling, focus groups and election results that says anti-immigration reform rhetoric and votes matter quite a lot, and not only with Hispanics. If Cruz\u2019s argument that all this data is wrong rests on an inaccurate assertion about his own experience, then Republicans should be wary. Not all of them are. Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) also endorsed the \u201cimmigration reform is offensive to Latinos\u201d line in an interview with the Daily Caller published Saturday. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on when Democrats and Republicans talk about immigration really is this battle over the Hispanic population now that is growing here in America and trying to win them over for future elections,\u201d Barletta told The Daily Caller. \u201cThat is so misguided and also demeaning to the Latino population, to believe that that is more important to people who are here than a good job, a good education, a better life.\u201d In January, the immigration hardliner portrayed Hispanics and Latin American immigrants as uneducated and government-dependent and said the GOP shouldn\u2019t bother winning over Latino voters at all. \u201cAnyone who believes that they\u2019re going to win over the Latino vote is grossly mistaken,\u201d Barletta said in January. \u201cThe majority that are here illegally are low-skilled or may not even have a high school diploma. The Republican Party is not going to compete over who can give more social programs out. They will become Democrats because of the social programs they\u2019ll depend on.\u201d Latinos use less than their fair share of government benefits, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The talking point is a variation of a strategy adopted during the Mitt Romney campaign last year, which emphasized that polls show the top concern for Latino voters is the economy and jobs rather than immigration. Romney lost the Hispanic vote by 27 percent to 71 percent.",

      "content": " Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin is calling on President Barack Obama to fire White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel over Emanuel\u2019s penchant for using profanity and a statement he made that was derogatory of the handicapped. Really. The 2008 vice presidential candidate put up a Facebook post on Monday evening arguing that Emanuel\u2019s offending slur (in which he said that liberal groups thinking of running health care-related ads against Democratic lawmakers were \u201cF\u2014-ing retarded\u201d) was no less the equivalent of using the \u201cN-word.\u201d I would ask the president to show decency in this process by eliminating one member of that inner circle, Mr. Rahm Emanuel, and not allow Rahm\u2019s continued indecent tactics to cloud efforts. Yes, Rahm is known for his caustic, crude references about those with whom he disagrees, but his recent tirade against participants in a strategy session was such a strong slap in many American faces that our president is doing himself a disservice by seeming to condone Rahm\u2019s recent sick and offensive tactic. The Obama Administration\u2019s Chief of Staff scolded participants, calling them, \u201cF\u2014-ing retarded,\u201d according to several participants, as reported in the Wall Street Journal. Just as we\u2019d be appalled if any public figure of Rahm\u2019s stature ever used the \u201cN-word\u201d or other such inappropriate language, Rahm\u2019s slur on all God\u2019s children with cognitive and developmental disabilities - and the people who love them - is unacceptable, and it\u2019s heartbreaking. The Emanuel remark was reported recently by The Wall Street Journal but dates back to  the heat of the health care wars in August. And it certainly wasn\u2019t the first time the chief of staff (known for an acid tongue) has leveled an odious broadside at one group or another from his perch in the West Wing. Palin presumably seized on this one because of her own experience with the issue \u2014 her youngest child, of course, suffers from Down syndrome. But it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that making hay out of \u201ccontroversies\u201d like these is her political trademark, regardless of whether there is a personal tie to the matter.",

      "content": " This story was first published in 2012, and has been published every year since. For one day each year, the turkey gets its time to shine. While most of that shining is done quite literally, as the glazed centerpiece of Thanksgiving feasts around the nation, a few fortunate fowl are granted pardons and given a chance to live out their\u00a0not-so-long lives in greener pastures, awkwardly bobbing their heads, crying gobble-gobble and whatever else it is that turkeys do. Those symbolic pardons may make the turkey eaters among us feel somewhat better about stuffing our faces with coma-inducing amounts of gravy-smothered poultry, yet during one such event in 2008, then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) managed to tear the mask (or head?) off the whole charade. We\u2019ll call it the greatest turkey-related disaster in the history of politics. Fresh off a defeat in the 2008 presidential election, Palin headed to a turkey farm in her hometown of Wasilla, Alaska, to pardon a local bird \u2015 a common practice among governors. Palin delivered her prepared remarks over frequent interruptions from clucking birds not as fortunate as the turkey getting the reprieve. She even touted herself as a \u201cfriend to all creatures great and small\u201d before posing for a photo op. What happened next was entirely unexpected. While many had recently learned that Palin could be unpredictable \u2015 even a maverick, perhaps \u2015 Americans couldn\u2019t have foreseen her conducting a lengthy on-camera interview while live birds were being fed into a machine of mass turkey murder mere feet behind her. Palin seemed to unwittingly nail her remarks, commenting on the need to find \u201clevity\u201d in her job as turkey after turkey was decapitated by the metal cone of death in the background. The man shoving the struggling birds into the device even looked up toward Palin and the camera as the governor presciently predicted that the spectacle would invite skepticism. (The goriest moments have been censored in the video above.) Although her office later denied that she\u2019d known what was playing out behind her, Palin was reportedly asked if she wanted that particular backdrop for her interview, to which she replied, \u201cNo worries.\u201d",

      "content": " Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin didn\u2019t cage her answer when pressed Sunday morning as to whether she would consider a run for president in 2012. \u201cI would, I would if I believe that is the right thing to do for our country and the Palin family. Certainly I would do so,\u201d she told \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d in an interview that was taped before she addressed a Tea Party convention the night before. \u201cI think that it would be absurd to not consider what it is that I could potentially do to help our country ... . I won\u2019t close a door that perhaps could be open for me in the future.\u201d In her first Sunday show appearance, the 2008 vice-presidential candidate predicted that, if the election were held today, President Barack Obama would actually lose the office he won just a year-and-a-half ago. But \u2014 citing a column written by Pat Buchanan \u2014 she left open the possibility that his fates could change, particularly (she seemed to wish) if a major attack were to be launched against Iran. Palin also used her platform to continue a call for the president to rid himself of his closest advisers. On Attorney General Eric Holder, she labeled his handling of captured terrorists \u2014 \u201callowing them our U.S. constitutional protections when they do not deserve them\u201d \u2014 a firing offense. On Chief-of-Staff Rahm Emanuel, she said his comments calling liberal groups \u201cf-ing retards\u201d was \u201cindecent and insensitive\u201d and cause for his dismissal. But the former governor went to great and sometimes awkward lengths to insist that when conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh used the same exact term to describe the same exact group, it was simply in the role of political humorist. \u201cThey are kooks, so I agree with Rush Limbaugh,\u201d she said, when read a quote of Limbaugh calling liberal groups \u201cretards.\u201d \u201cRush Limbaugh was using satire ... . I didn\u2019t hear Rush Limbaugh calling a group of people whom he did not agree with \u2018f-ing retards,\u2019 and we did know that Rahm Emanuel, as has been reported, did say that. There is a big difference there.\u201d In the 30-minute sit down with host Chris Wallace, Palin addressed a wide swath of largely political topics \u2014 the policy minutia, undoubtedly, saved for another time and place. She dismissed charges that her husband Todd played an unacceptably active role in guiding her administration as governor, after it was revealed in recently disclosed emails that the \u201cfirst dude\u201d was often consulted on weighty matters. She acknowledged moderate successes in Obama\u2019s foreign policy \u2014 specifically towards Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2014 but still questioned why the president \u201cpals around\u201d with domestic terrorists (Bill Ayers). Finally, she declined several attempts to weigh in on other prospective 2012 candidates, citing only Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) as someone who she admired and found intriguing. The impression, in the end, was left that she was charting out a candidacy of her own. Pressed about reports that she was being consulted by a group of Washington-based advisers \u2014 those insider elites she often bemoans \u2014 on issues both domestic and foreign, she didn\u2019t exactly shoot down the idea that it was prep work for a White House run. \u201cEver since our PAC was formed we have had good people contributing, some, many volunteers, I guess you would call them advisers yes, fire away emails to me every morning saying this is what happened in Washington overnight, you need to be aware of this,\u201d Palin said. \u201cI have no idea how conventionally people [run for the White House]. How they open a door that perhaps isn\u2019t even open. ... I don\u2019t know how any of that stuff works. I\u2019m just appreciative of having some good information at my fingertips now.\u201d",

      "content": " On the matter of Sarah Palin, Newsweek magazine, and THE SEXISM, I think that the Washington City Paper\u2018s Amanda Hess has basically won the entire discussion. Is the Newsweek cover sexist? Yes. But let\u2019s put the photo back into context for a minute: Sarah Palin\u2019s entire existence is sexist. Let\u2019s try to imagine, for a moment, the thought process that went into creating this Newsweek cover image : \u201cWe need to convey that Palin sucks really bad! Let\u2019s take some photo of Palin lookin\u2019 sexy, slap it on the cover of Newsweek, and then use her sexuality in attempt to draw attention to all the terrible things this woman has brought upon us.\u201d Hey! That sounds kind of like what John McCain did when he chose Palin as his VP: Found an attractive lady, slapped her on to his campaign, and used her image as a sexy lady in order to distract people from her scant qualifications, her total lack of concern for women\u2019s issues, and her complete suckiness as a candidate. Real talk. As Hess points out, Palin has been subjected to a noticeable share of deplorable treatment. And I think it\u2019s absurd to suggest that Newsweek selected this photo from Runner\u2019s World magazine because they thought it would cast the subject of their cover story in a neutral light or elucidate the magazine\u2019s underlying point. I think that Newsweek made the choice they did to ensure that if they couldn\u2019t manage a discrediting of Palin on the merits, they could plant their discrediting through some cheap subtextual shortcut. But Hess is correct when she points out that \u201cthe game works both ways.\u201d  You remember that whole day of our lives that was given over to that riveting discussion over whether the phrase \u201clipstick on a pig,\u201d was a sexist slag at Sarah Palin?  Because at one point, Palin had used the word \u201clipstick\u201d in a joke?  That bought Palin a whole day of media figures rising to her defense over something that was plainly nonsensical.  Hess puts it like this: \u201cI am sick and tired of only having to care about it when that sexism means something bad for Sarah Palin.\u201d  But you know what?  That, too, is \u201coh-so-expected by now.\u201d RELATED:\n\nSarah Palin\u2019s Entire Existence Is Sexist [The Sexist] PREVIOUSLY, on the HUFFINGTON POST:\n\nI\u2019m Officially Shutting Down This \u2018Lipstick On A Pig\u2019 Discussion [Would you like to follow me on Twitter?

      "content": "Sarah PAC, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee, raised more than $1.4 million in the second-half of 2009, according to the Washington Post\u2019s Chris Cillizza. That figure brings the group\u2019s fundraising haul to $2.1 million for 2009. Cillizza reports: ...Sarah PAC and ended the year with $900,000 in the bank. She donated $64,600 to candidates and party committees. That relatively high burn rate is due to an expansion of the organization\u2019s staff, according to those familiar with its operations. (Remember that with Palin out of office \u2014 she resigned the governorship in July 2009 \u2014 her PAC is her only political and policy vehicle.) Beyond new staff and donations, what else is Sarah PAC spending money on? Books \u2014 her own book \u2014 according to ABC News: The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate had her political organization spend more than $63,000 on what her reports describe as \u201cbooks for fundraising donor fulfillment.\u201d The payments went to Harper Collins, her publisher, and in some instances to HSP Direct, a Virginia-based direct mail fundraising firm that serves a number of well-known conservative politicians and pundits. Sarah PAC spent another $8,000 on colorful bookmarks designed by a Nashville-based event branding firm. And her committee paid her publisher $20,000 for what appears to have been the cost of sending her personal photographer and another aide along on her book tour. Hotline offers a more detailed breakdown of the former governor\u2019s expenditures. How many copies of \u201cGoing Rogue\u201d would $63,000 buy? It depends. Without knowing how much sales tax was paid on the books or if the former governor bought them at a bulk rate, Palin\u2019s group could have bought anywhere from 2,173 (at suggested full retail price of $28.99) to 4,666 copies (at a steeply discounted Amazon rate of $13.50).",

      "content": " MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 When most people think back on Sarah Palin\u2019s F5 tornado of a 2008 vice-presidential run, one of a few lasting images might jump immediately to mind. If you\u2019re a fan of hers, maybe it\u2019s the pitch-perfect line about hockey moms and pit bulls that she ad-libbed at her barnburner of a nomination speech at the Republican convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. If you\u2019re not, perhaps it\u2019s the Alaska moose-in-headlights moment when she failed to provide Katie Couric with the name of a single newspaper or magazine that she read to stay informed. For me, it\u2019s something different. During the 2008 general election, I was one of less than a dozen journalists who traveled around the country with Palin from the beginning of her campaign to the end of it as an off-air reporter for CBS News. In this role, I had an up-close view of the woman who most Americans only saw on their TV screens, or \u2014 if they were a supporter \u2014 from whatever vantage point they managed to secure among the cheering crowds that regularly numbered in the tens of thousands around the country. Palin and I flew on the same chartered campaign plane, laughed in unison as we watched Tina Fey role out her uncanny impression on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d and interacted fairly regularly as fellow travelers on a shared, strange trip \u2014 particularly after she \u201cwent rogue\u201d and started talking to her assigned press corps more frequently. No matter the campaign\u2019s intended message of the day \u2014 or what McCain\u2019s strategists wanted her to say \u2014 there were two topics that Palin never failed to bring up on her own wherever she went: People with disabilities and the heroism of her running mate, John McCain. Most of the country saw Palin as a two-dimensional caricature, but I never once questioned her sincerity when it came to these particular causes.\u00a0After all, I was there when she exchanged a series of heartfelt hugs with a woman afflicted with Down syndrome in Pennsylvania and watched as she lingered to commiserate with Gold Star moms in Indianapolis. And as my co-author Shushannah Walshe and I reported in our 2009 book, Sarah From Alaska, on election night at McCain headquarters in Arizona, Palin sought to give her own heartfelt concession speech that relied heavily on the two subject matters that she was most passionate about. The speech, which McCain campaign aides ultimately barred her from delivering, included a particularly touching recollection of Palin\u2019s interaction with a boy with Down syndrome named Charlie, whom she had met at a rally in Florida. \u201cSo tonight, a special shout-out to you, Chuck\u2026 darlin\u2019,\u201d Palin intended to say in her address in defeat that night. \u201cAnd let me repeat what I told you, because it applies to you and to all children and adults with special needs across America: You are beautiful, and I am so proud to know that my boy Trig will grow up to be just like you \u2026 it\u2019s time America shows you her good heart.\u201d On her second pet topic \u2014 McCain\u2019s exceptional bravery \u2014 Palin had intended to deliver another particularly eloquent salute: Above all, I am grateful to the man who took a chance on me. From that moment to this, I have had the rare enough privilege in politics of praising a candidate whose story, character, and personal heroism required no embellishment. I said things about him \u2014 about how valiantly he has served and what he has overcome \u2014 things he could not say about himself, because he is that kind of man. It would be a happier night if elections were a test of valor and merit alone, but that is not for us to question now. Enough to say it has been the honor of a lifetime to fight at the side of John S. McCain. Perhaps it was for the best that McCain\u2019s aides did not allow her to give the speech that night. If they had, Palin may have felt a tinge of the shame that appeared to be entirely lacking during the full-throated endorsement she gave Donald Trump on Tuesday night. Trump, you\u2019ll recall, is the Republican presidential front-runner, who in July unapologetically declared that McCain \u2014 a former Vietnam War prisoner of war who spent five-and-a-half-years in captivity, and endured torture at the Hanoi Hilton \u2014 was \u201cnot a war hero\u201d before adding a memorable addendum, as only he could. \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d said Trump, who has pointed to a \u201cfoot thing\u201d as one reason why he received a series of deferments during the Vietnam era. And, yes. Trump is also the same guy who in November stood on a stage and performed a crude imitation of a New York Times reporter who suffers from a physical disability. Now, imagine for a moment that we\u2019re back in 2008 during those tumultuous autumn weeks when the markets were melting down and Palin was seeking to lift the GOP ticket to an unlikely comeback through the sheer force of her personality. What if then it had been a Democrat who\u2019d questioned McCain\u2019s heroism or mocked a person with a disability in front of a cheering crowd? How might Sarah Palin have responded to that? I have a pretty good guess. Let\u2019s just say that the echoes of righteous indignation would\u2019ve been audible from here to Wasilla. Until her shameless endorsement of America\u2019s most famous bully, Palin largely had been loyal to McCain \u2014 the man who plucked her from relative obscurity in Alaska and made her a household name. At the height of the Tea Party wave, for instance, Palin endorsed and campaigned for McCain against his conservative challenger during a tough 2010 Republican primary fight in Arizona. And McCain, in turn, has offered nothing but public praise for his former running mate in the ensuing years. Still, Palin\u2019s endorsement of her fellow reality TV star shouldn\u2019t come as a complete surprise. Politically, Palin and Trump have much in common in their anti-establishment instincts, ideological fluidity and eagerness to use vitriol as their most potent weapon against adversaries. And in several ways, Trump\u2019s campaign represents the realization of the grievance-driven populism that Palin first brought to national prominence eight years ago. Her endorsement wasn\u2019t a surprise to me. Palin had made her intentions pretty clear on this front back in July when she argued with a straight face that, hey, Donald\u2019s a hero, too \u2014 just like McCain! Much like Trump, Palin\u2019s every public move these days appears intended to boost her brand \u2014 the brand that has made her untold millions of dollars since she quit her day job in mid term back in 2009, but has become less potent by the year since then. And for a fading celebrity-politician in desperate need of a new jolt of attention and influence, the ability to give Trump a much-needed boost among conservatives in Iowa was a temptation too powerful to turn down \u2014 it made sense in the context of Palin\u2019s need to maintain whatever is left of the political image she so carefully protects. It probably didn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to McCain though \u2014 or to Charlie.",

      "content": " Yesterday, while in a deep and ethereal reverie about \u201cGame Change: The Movie,\u201d which was based on \u201cGame Change: The Book,\u201d which was based on \u201cGame Change: The Catchphrase,\u201d Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen surmised that Sarah Palin had personally ruined politics forever. By his reckoning, the emergence of Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry \u2014 really, all of the candidates in the GOP race not named \u201cMitt Romney\u201d \u2014 was evidence of the fact that the GOP had decided to embrace Palinesque qualities in their candidates. And on further review, Cohen told his readers that he was quite sure that the Democrats would one day follow suit and embrace such candidates as well, because everyone knows that politicians who defame government and ridicule compromise typically ascend to stratospheric heights in the Democratic Party. Well, if my counterargument wasn\u2019t enough, let\u2019s turn to the Daily Caller, where Ann Coulter argues that Palin\u2019s legacy in this regard is wholly owned by the GOP. (Countering Cohen with Coulter just feels right to me, you know?) Coulter, having observed that Palin has been one of the loudest voices to promote both a \u201cbrokered convention\u201d and herself as the solution to that deadlock, jumped to what she saw as a problem in the GOP: Coulter said that might be a weakness in the Republican Party as a whole \u2014 that certain individuals become celebrities and are allowed to profit off that status and yet still interfere in GOP politics, which Democrats have been able to avoid. \u201cAnd just a more corporate problem is I think our party and particularly our movement, the conservative movement, does have more of a problem with con men and charlatans than the Democratic Party,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, the incentives seem to be set up to allow people \u2014 as long as you have a band of a few million fanatical followers, you can make money. The Democrats have managed to figure out how not to do that.\u201d Coulter\u2019s solution? Another one of those pledge thingies. Hers would preclude Republican presidential candidates from seeking to \u201cprofit off of political stardom.\u201d \u201cI want them to sign a pledge,\u201d said Coulter, \u201csaying, \u2018If I lose the nomination I pledge I will not take a gig with Fox News or write a book.\u2019\u201d I\u2019m not entirely sure how this would work \u2014 the pre-primary season candidate memoir seems to be a perennial fixture of the presidential cycle, and occasionally, they are very profitable. I\u2019d also point out that while Mike Huckabee definitely parlayed his presidential candidacy into a lucrative television career, it seems to me that he has managed to do this in a fairly humble and tasteful way. Besides, in politics, one needn\u2019t achieve \u201cstardom\u201d to end up some sort of well-compensated embarrassment. Just look at Evan Bayh!

Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee, SarahPAC, is kicking off what is likely to be a busy year with $1.3 million in the bank, Politico\u2019s look at the group\u2019s Federal Election Commission filings finds. The FEC records show that Palin raised $279,000 over a five-week period at the end of the year, donations that came primarily in sums of $200 or less. The PAC also spent nearly $230,000 during the filing period and a total of nearly $2.6 million throughout 2010, according to the report. Perhaps the most interesting tidbit, however, is the apparent lack of any notable fundraising or staffing push from the political arm of a candidate who has been among the most talked-about potential 2012 GOP presidential contenders. From Politico\u2019s report: The filing shows no indication that Palin has started to ramp up for a potential presidential run, as no new staff shows up on SarahPAC\u2019s expenses \u2014 which remain very low compared to a campaign of even moderate size. Her PAC spent nearly $230,000 for the period between the end of the campaign and end of the calendar year, and over $2.6 million in 2010. Despite those details, a recent report from RealClearPolitics suggested that Palin\u2019s operatives are, in fact, actively developing a ground game in the key primary state of Iowa, though perhaps not in a manner that would be clear from the FEC filing. From the RealClearPolitics report: Palin\u2019s initial Iowa push appears to differ most clearly from that of other candidates in that no SarahPAC staffer has been assigned to work the state on the ground, and her aides are not yet making hard pushes to lock up experienced operatives. According to RCP, Palin\u2019s pre-campaign architecture has instead been heavily constructed through third-party grassroots activists and private discussions with local Tea Party leaders.",

On Monday, the company released\u00a0a statement defending the comedian\u00a0and star of its new comedy series \u201cWho Is America?\u201d after former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin claimed that Baron Cohen \u201cduped\u201d her into an interview by pretending to be a disabled war veteran named Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr., Ph.D. It\u2019s an accusation that Baron Cohen has publicly denied, albeit in character. Last week Ruddick\u2019s Twitter account said, \u201cI did NOT say I was a War Vet. I was in the service \u2015 not military, but United Parcel, and I only fought for my country once \u2015 when I shot a Mexican who came onto my property.\u201d In its more sober response this week, Showtime said: There has been widespread misinformation over the past week about the character of Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr., Ph.D., performed by Sacha Baron Cohen on the Showtime comedy series Who Is America? Baron Cohen did not present himself as a disabled veteran, and viewers nationwide who watched the premiere on Sunday can now attest to that. The premium cable network then pointed to Baron-Cohen-as-Ruddick\u2019s interview of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the first episode. Sanders asked Ruddick if he was disabled. \u201cHe stated that he is not and uses a mobility scooter to conserve his energy,\u201d Showtime wrote. The network said that in dealing with Palin, Baron Cohen never presented himself as a U.S. military veteran and never wore any military apparel of any kind \u201cduring the booking process or during the filming of her interview.\u201d Showtime also noted that Baron Cohen did not appear in a wheelchair. Last week the former Alaska governor published a scathing post on her website and her\u00a0Facebook page\u00a0describing her experience with Baron Cohen\u2019s \u201cevil, exploitive, sick \u2018humor.\u2019\u201d\u00a0She called on the former \u201cBorat\u201d star, Showtime and CBS (Showtime\u2019s parent company) to \u201cdonate all proceeds to a charitable group that actually respects and supports American Vets.\u201d Disgraced former Alabama senatorial candidate\u00a0Roy Moore also claimed last week that he was conned into an interview with Baron Cohen and accused the comedian of \u201ctrickery, deception and dishonesty.\u201d A\u00a0#BoycottShowtime campaign has been\u00a0launched on Twitter. This week, a billboard appeared across the street from CBS studios in Los Angeles, per the Hollywood Reporter. The billboard, which was reportedly created by a \u201cconservative street artist,\u201d reads: \u201cSacha Baron Cohen Walks Away With a Hit ... and a touch of stolen valor. Who Is America? Sat, 9pm. CBS.\u201d Not every public personality who was interviewed by Baron Cohen as Ruddick has lashed out after discovering that they were misled. Ted Koppel admitted to being fooled by Baron Cohen last week as well. The veteran journalist said he had a feeling that something was off when the man who was interviewing him \u2014 whom Koppel described as sitting in a wheelchair with an oxygen tank \u2014 kept asking him about the crowd size at President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration rather than questions pertaining to the subject matter Koppel was told they\u2019d discuss.",

On Thursday, Baron Cohen couldn\u2019t resist poking fun at Palin again after the Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated him for \u201cBest Performance by an Actor in a Television Series, Musical, or Comedy.\u201d \u201cThis show was a labour of love for over two years,\u201d he said in a statement to Entertainment Weekly. \u201cIt is a shame they overlooked the amazing performances by the rest of the cast, particularly Dick Cheney and Roy Moore,\u201d Baron Cohen jokingly added. \u201cMeanwhile Ms. Palin, despite being cut from the show, I hope you will accept my invitation to be my date for the ceremony.\u201d Those duped by Baron Cohen for the show included disgraced former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, failed GOP U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, former Georgia state Rep. Jason Spencer (R) and former Vice President Dick Cheney. Check out the rest of the Golden Globes 2019 nominees here.",

The specific passages in question have since been spliced together by a Tea Party activist who asks, \u201cWho Is Vaughn Ward Really?\u201d Mike Tracy, a spokesman for Ward\u2019s campaign tried to downplay the video, telling Politico that the attack was a sign that \u201c[f]olks are getting desperate \u2014 they\u2019re saying anything to get Vaughn to go after him. If anyone thinks he\u2019s anything like Obama, they\u2019re dead wrong.\u201d These allegations come after a series of missteps for the GOP candidate\u2019s campaign. Ward fired his campaign manager following an embarrassing discovery that he had borrowed heavily from the campaign language of various other GOP politicians. Ward later sought to rebound from that hiccup with a high-profile appearance with Sarah Palin, who endorsed him \u2014 along with other military veterans \u2014 back in March, but the event was slightly tarnished by multiple reports showing that Ward had referred to Puerto Rico as a \u201ccountry\u201d during a recent debate. Republican voters in Idaho will go to the polls Tuesday to choose between Ward and his challenger, State Rep. Raul Labrador. Recent polling shows Ward leading Labrador 31 percent to 28 percent, with undecideds making up 37 percent. A similar poll from earlier in May had Ward leading 34 percent to 16 percent.

According to the survey the approval rating of Palin\u2019s replacement, Republican Gov. Sean Parnell, stands at 58 percent, while only 19 percent disapprove. These high marks also remain consistent across party lines, with 51 percent of Democrats and 55 percent of Independents approving.
