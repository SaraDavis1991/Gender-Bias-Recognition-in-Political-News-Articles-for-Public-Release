      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Look up \u201ccorrupt\u201d in the dictionary and you could expect to find an illustration of Donald Trump looking right back \u2015 yet that has not kept the president from repeatedly calling others corrupt in recent weeks. Trump has given his daughter and son-in-law prominent White House jobs, steers lobbyists and political groups seeking his favor toward using his Pennsylvania Avenue hotel, and even successfully pushed the U.S. government to host the next G-7 meeting\u00a0at his own golf resort, which will put tens of millions of American tax dollars into his own cash registers next June. \u201cHe has no shame,\u201d said Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman who is running against Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. \u201cHe\u2019s incapable of shame. That\u2019s not normal.\u201d Indeed, such actions, had they been taken by a mayor, a county executive or a governor, would in all likelihood result in state or federal public corruption charges. While laws and rules vary by state and locality, ethics laws generally prohibit public officials from profiting from their offices. Giving oneself a large government contract \u2015 as Trump\u2019s White House announced Thursday with the selection of his troubled Doral, Florida, golf course as the site of the next summit of the world\u2019s largest democratic economies \u2015 would almost certainly result in a criminal prosecution, ethics experts said. \u201cThis is a president who believes the powers of the presidency are bestowed on him to advance his own personal interests, political and profit-seeking, rather than those of the American people,\u201d said Robert Weissman, president of the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen. But as the sitting president, Trump is immune from both ethics laws and criminal prosecution, and not only has he openly engaged in nepotism and self-dealing, he has, in recent weeks, started accusing political opponents and the news media of \u201ccorruption.\u201d At an Oct. 2 news conference, for example, he called former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter \u201cstone, cold corrupt.\u201d At an Oct. 11 rally in Lake Charles, Louisiana, he broadened that to all Democrats: \u201cThe radical Democrats\u2019 policies are crazy. Their politicians are corrupt.\u201d In an Oct. 14 statement he posted on Twitter, Trump called The New York Times corrupt. Just two days later, during a photo opportunity with the visiting president of Italy, he called his predecessor Barack Obama corrupt, as well as the entire 2016 election. Others Trump has labeled \u201ccorrupt\u201d in recent weeks: former FBI director James Comey, former FBI agent Peter Strzok, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, the entire Mueller investigation into the help Russia gave Trump in winning the 2016 election, all of the news media, California Democratic congressman Adam Schiff and CNN. To Trump critics, the president\u2019s attacks are part of a predictable pattern: Accuse others of the inappropriate behavior that he himself engages in. Bandy Lee, among a group of mental health professionals who have been warning of Trump\u2019s state of mind for years, said Trump is exhibiting typical behavior for a \u201cparanoid, delusional\u201d leader. \u201cHe accuses others exactly of what he is responsible for,\u201d said Lee, a Yale Medical School professor of psychiatry. \u201cIt is a psychological defense called \u2018projection.\u2019\u201d Josh Schwerin, a former spokesman for 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, recalled Trump\u2019s response when Clinton accused Trump of behaving like Russian dictator Vladimir Putin\u2019s puppet. \u201cNo puppet. No puppet. You\u2019re the puppet,\u201d Trump replied at the third and final presidential debate. \u201cHe accuses other people of doing the bad things he\u2019s doing,\u201d Schwerin said. \u201cHe is the most corrupt president in modern times,\u201d said Jennifer Horn, a former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party. \u201cHe has to convince his followers that everyone is corrupt so they will ignore his corruption.\u201d The White House did not respond to HuffPost queries regarding Trump\u2019s self-dealing and nepotism. One top Republican National Committee member, though, said he is not bothered by any of Trump\u2019s behavior, and instead attacked the news media for not reporting sufficiently on the Clinton Foundation, Hunter Biden or the money former Obama has made since leaving office. \u201cA few dollars on his hotels, which are actually a legitimate business, I\u2019m not going to lose much sleep over,\u201d said Shawn Steel, a longtime RNC member from California, urging more scrutiny of Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Damaging Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 candidacy was a key objective of Trump\u2019s newfound interest in rooting out \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine, according to a top Trump adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. Trump believes Biden would be his strongest opponent and has sought to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate a conspiracy theory that Ukrainian officials seeking to help Hillary Clinton win the 2016 election planted false evidence to make it appear that Russia had helped Trump. According to that conspiracy theory, which also manages to tie in the Bidens and Hungarian billionaire George Soros and the framing of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the hacked Democratic National Committee server and Clinton\u2019s 33,000 deleted emails have been hidden away somewhere in Ukraine. Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, has called the claim \u201ccompletely debunked\u201d and warned that Trump\u2019s obsession with it would be the \u201cwhite whale\u201d that could bring him down. Indeed, it was Trump\u2019s request of Ukraine\u2019s president in a July 25 phone call to investigate both the Bidens and the 2016 election conspiracy that sparked a whistleblower complaint against Trump, which in turn led to the ongoing impeachment inquiry. White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted Thursday that those considerations played into Trump\u2019s policy toward Ukraine. \u201cGet over it: There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d he said. Kendal Unruh, a former GOP activist from Colorado who led the unsuccessful effort to dump Trump at the 2016 party convention, said it was distressing to see Republicans tolerating the president\u2019s actions. \u201cThe Republican Party has become completely corrupted to the core in their habitual defense of Trump\u2019s behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to watch the death of a party that once actually stood for morality and the rule of law.\u201d Yet Yale psychiatrist Lee said increasing pressure on Trump with the threat of impeachment will create a far greater danger to the country than the mere diminishment of a political party. \u201cHis emotional drive to project all his own corruption and ineptitude onto others will overwhelm any ability on the part of others to correct or redirect his lies,\u201d she said. \u201cThis drive will become more severe with greater pressure and, paradoxically, the sicker he is, the more effective his pathology will be in overcoming any resistance, starting with himself.\u201d",

Richard Painter, the former chief ethics attorney for President George W.

In that case, he will do everything.\u201d Shaub also said it was \u201ca red line crossed\u201d and that \u201cwe have reached the bottom.\u201d \u201cIf the Senate will not act to stop this, there is no government ethics program,\u201d he posted. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Read Shaub\u2019s tweets in full below:",

Neither Ryan nor Buttigieg\u2019s campaign immediately responded to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment. Last month, Buttigieg invited Ryan to attend a Congressional Black Caucus dinner as his guest. On Instagram, the reporter shared photos with Buttigieg and fellow candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), noting that Barack Obama had invited her to the event during his own presidential campaign. In July, Ryan moderated the NAACP\u2019s 110th annual convention in Detroit, where she interviewed both Buttigieg and Warren in addition to several other candidates including former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen.

On Friday\u2019s broadcast of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball,\u201d Shaub said acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s dismissal of fears that Trump could personally profit from the event were \u201ca ridiculous thing\u201d to say. Trump has been accused of violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officeholders from accepting gifts or profits from foreign states, with the decision. \u201cEssentially, it boils down to this, the president in the United States participated in a contract awarded to his own business,\u201d said Shaub, who served under former President Barack Obama and the first six months of Trump\u2019s administration until he resigned. \u201cThis is the figurative equivalent of he reaches into the treasury, grabs a chunk of money and says \u2018don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not taking more than I\u2019m spending,\u2019\u201d Shaub continued. \u201cThat\u2019s no defense at all and certainly, if it had been Mick Mulvaney who owned this property, he\u2019d be prosecuted and convicted of a felony and wouldn\u2019t be able to say \u2018don\u2019t worry, I broke even.\u2019\u201d Shaub later summed up the \u201cthe bottom line.\u201d \u201cThere is no definition of corruption that would not cover the president participating in a contract awarded to himself.\u00a0So, if this is not corrupt, nothing is corrupt,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what he wants and it seems to be exactly what the United States Senate is determined to have be the case.\u201d Shaub on Thursday claimed the decision to host the event at the resort\u00a0was \u201cso overtly corrupt that it can\u2019t be viewed as anything but a loyalty test for Senators.\u201d \u201cIf they are corrupt enough to look the other way, Trump will know he can do anything.

      "subtitle": "Bill de Blasio, Tulsi Gabbard and Michael Bennet aren\u2019t going to be president. But they each shined for a moment in Wednesday\u2019s Democratic primary debate.",
      "author": "Zach Carter",
      "content": " The early Democratic Party 2020 debates have often demanded a very specific torture of the viewer. With 20 candidates allowed to participate, serious contenders don\u2019t get enough time to detail their differences, while vanity candidates with pathetic polling and no real reason for running waste everyone\u2019s time. It\u2019s tedious. But on Wednesday night, three candidates with no chance of becoming president nevertheless did their country a service, presenting detailed and accurate critiques of the Democrats who do have a real chance of being elected. Though it pains me to say it, the gadflies brought their A-game. Early in the night, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio hit former Vice President Joe Biden over former President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration record. Democrats don\u2019t like to harp on it, but in his first four years in office, Obama deported more people per year than any other president in history. Immigration activists protested Obama for most of his presidency, and former Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) called him \u201cthe deporter in chief\u201d on the House floor. Obama even separated children from their parents at the border, though not in the systemic manner that President Donald Trump has. So de Blasio asked Biden a simple question. \u201cDid you say those deportations were a good idea or did you go to the president and say this is a mistake, we shouldn\u2019t do it. Which one?\u201d Biden didn\u2019t really have an answer. Awkwardly, he said he would keep his conversations with Obama on immigration private. Bill de Blasio is probably never going to make it to double-digits in national polling. On Wednesday night protesters interrupted the debate to rip him for failing to take action against Daniel Pantaleo, the police officer who killed Eric Garner. But de Blasio\u2019s confrontation with Biden nevertheless gave Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) an opening to drive home an important point about the Obama administration. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Booker told Biden. \u201cYou invoke President Obama more than anyone else in this campaign. You can\u2019t do it when it\u2019s convenient and then duck it when it\u2019s not.\u201d Because Obama remains the most popular figure in the Democratic Party, most 2020 contenders have been reluctant to criticize his administration\u2019s flaws \u2015 even on issues where the Democratic Party needs to learn from Obama\u2019s shortcomings. But therein lies the benefit of gadflies, whose only real shot at staying in the race is generating some buzz by going toe-to-toe with the front-runners. The results weren\u2019t cheap shots but substantive critiques. Later in the evening, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii went after the criminal justice record that Sen. Kamala Harris accrued first as a prosecutor in San Francisco and then as California\u2019s attorney general. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about this record,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cThere are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when asked if she ever smoked marijuana. She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so, she kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use as cheap labor for the state of California and she fought to keep cash bail in place.\u201d Gabbard, to be clear, is a terrible candidate. She\u2019s been an apologist for Syrian butcher Bashar Assad and has troubling ties to Hindu nationalists, and she has spent a lot of time on Fox News ranting about Islam. But her criticisms of Harris were on point and have been documented in detail by journalists and criminal justice reform advocates. During her career in California, Harris was a tough-on-crime prosecutor and has sought to rebrand herself as a progressive prosecutor since coming to Washington. \u201cAs the elected attorney general of California,\u201d Harris said Wednesday, \u201cI did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people, which became a national model for the work that needs to be done.\u201d Other gadflies made an impact without directly attacking a candidate by just saying something true, very loudly. Sen. Michael Bennet (Colo.) has struggled to stand out in every debate and wasted a lot of his stage time Wednesday issuing cheap Republican talking points about \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d But even Bennet had a standout moment, pointing out that American schools have re-segregated over recent decades and, in many cases, simply never really integrated. Most children attend schools that are either very white or very non-white, and the non-white schools generally don\u2019t get nearly as much funding as the white schools do. \u201cThis is the fourth debate that we have had and the second time that we have been debating what people did 50 years ago with busing when our schools are as segregated as they were 50 years ago,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cWe need a conversation about what\u2019s happening now, and when there\u2019s a group of kids in this country that don\u2019t get preschool through no fault of their own and another group does, equal is not equal.\u201d Like deportation and criminal justice, school segregation is an uncomfortable subject for Democrats because many of the party\u2019s leading figures built their careers in the party by feeding the problem. Booker, for instance, used to advocate for the school voucher agenda of current Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. For a long time, vouchers were a favorite policy tool conservatives used to help rich white students attend all-white or nearly-all-white private schools. The Democratic Party is in a period of transition. Many of the policies that the party supported under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama are being jettisoned, and new ideas are gaining traction. The gadflies aren\u2019t going to be the leaders who chart the party\u2019s future. But if they can bring its past into the light, maybe they deserve a spot on the stage.",

      "content": " President Barack Obama\u00a0on Wednesday mourned the death of former Supreme Court Justice\u00a0John Paul Stevens, who died the day before at age 99. Stevens retired from the high court in 2010 after serving on the bench for almost 35 years. He was the third-longest-serving justice of the Supreme Court. He died in a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after a stroke. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have known Justice John Paul Stevens for all of his 99 years, but I\u2019m lucky enough to have known him for some of them,\u201d\u00a0Obama, who was president when Stevens retired, said in a statement. \u201cHe was a good man, a decent man. And our country is better because of his leadership and his example.\u201d \u201cFor more than 34 years on the bench at the Supreme Court, Justice Stevens heard cases with a level of grace, humility, and fidelity to our highest ideals that we should hope all our public servants strive for,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHis balancing of legal precedent with the Constitution\u2019s call for equal justice and an understanding of Americans\u2019 daily lives helped the court \u2014 and the country \u2014 navigate controversial and defining questions of who we are and who we can be. And in doing so with his signature pragmatism and modesty, he played a pivotal role in carrying forward our founding promise into today.\u201d Republican President Gerald Ford nominated Stevens, also a Republican, to the Supreme Court in 1975. Although he told The New York Times Magazine in 2007 that he thought of himself as \u201cpretty darn conservative,\u201d Stevens is often considered a liberal champion of the court. The justice wrote majority opinions on a wide range of issues, including abortion rights, capital punishment, school prayer and campaign-finance reform. Stevens led the high court\u2019s efforts to uphold legal protections for Guantanamo Bay prisoners after President George W. Bush\u2019s administration argued after the 9/11 attacks that prisoners there were not entitled to access to U.S. courts because they were not U.S. citizens and were being held on American soil. In retirement, Stevens remained an outspoken critic of the U.S. policy of detaining enemy combatants in Guantanamo without charges. In May 2012, Obama awarded Stevens a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, for his decadeslong career upholding the Constitution and the laws of the United States. \u201cKnown for his independent, pragmatic and rigorous approach to judging, Justice Stevens and his work have left a lasting imprint on the law in areas such as civil rights, the First Amendment, the death penalty, administrative law, and the separation of powers,\u201d the White House said at the time.

      "author": "Elise Foley",
      "content": " In one of the hottest moments of the Democratic primary debate on Wednesday, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) turned to face former Vice President Joe Biden and said, \u201cMr. Vice President, you can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d Booker was referring to Biden\u2019s (and President Barack Obama\u2019s) record on immigration: During their two terms, a record number of immigrants were deported, earning Obama the title of \u201cdeporter-in-chief\u201d from some immigrants\u2019 rights advocates. \u201cYou invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign,\u201d Booker said during the CNN-hosted debate. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it when it\u2019s convenient and then dodge it when it\u2019s not.\u201d For his part, Biden defended Obama, while refusing to say whether he\u2019d done anything to stop deportations. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) repeatedly pressed him on the matter but never got an answer. \u201cDid you say those deportations were a good idea?\u201d de Blasio asked. \u201cOr did you go to the president and say, \u2018This is a mistake. We shouldn\u2019t do it.\u2019 Which one?\u201d Biden both distanced himself from Obama\u2019s record and refused to answer the question. \u201cI was vice president. I was not the president,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI keep my recommendation to him private.\u201d Biden noted repeatedly that Obama enacted pro-immigrant policies \u2014 like legal protections for young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children \u2014 and made a major push for comprehensive immigration reform. That reform push ultimately failed because congressional GOP leaders refused to take it up, in spite of the years of high deportation figures that were intended, in part, to convince Republicans that Democrats weren\u2019t soft on unauthorized immigration. Obama later shifted his policies and his deportation figures dropped. Now, with President Donald Trump in office, Democrats are unified in support of comprehensive immigration reform and in opposition to the current president\u2019s policies, including separating children from parents. But the particulars of the immigration policy debate have shifted. So far this cycle, one of the main issues at hand has been whether to repeal the law that makes it a criminal offense to cross the border without authorization. Decriminalizing that type of migration would mean that immigrants could still face deportation or civil penalties for crossing \u2015 but they couldn\u2019t be criminally prosecuted, which is how the Trump administration was able to split up immigrant families last year. Much like during Tuesday evening\u2019s debate, the candidates were divided into two camps regarding immigration: those who insisted that nothing needs to be done beyond removing Trump and those who wanted to repeal the law. Biden opposes decriminalizing migration, and said that Trump is the reason the law is being abused. He also pointed out that opponent Juli\u00e1n Castro, the top booster of decriminalization, served in the Obama administration too, as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \u201cMr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned from the lessons of the past,\u201d Castro responded, \u201cand one of us hasn\u2019t.\u201d",

      "content": " Britain\u2019s now former ambassador to the U.S. was convinced last year that President Donald Trump scrapped the Iran nuclear pact in part simply because it was forged by his White House predecessor,\u00a0Barack Obama, according to another leaked diplomatic memo. Sir Kim Darroch declared that Trump\u2019s actions amounted to \u201cdiplomatic vandalism,\u201d\u00a0the Daily Mail reported on Saturday, quoting the cable. The newspaper\u00a0obtained an earlier set of leaked cables from Darroch blasting Trump as a man who \u201cradiates insecurity\u201d and his administration as \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and \u201cinept.\u201d The leaks resulted in a vicious attack on Darroch by Trump and the envoy\u2019s resignation on Wednesday. In the latest leaked cables to his government, Darroch said the Trump administration was \u201cset upon an act of diplomatic vandalism, seemingly for ideological and personality reasons \u2014 it was Obama\u2019s deal,\u201d the newspaper reported, referring to the Iranian pact. \u201cMoreover, they can\u2019t articulate any \u2018day-after\u2019 strategy; and contacts with State Department this morning suggest no sort of plan for reaching out to partners and allies, whether in Europe or the region,\u201d Darroch wrote, according to the Mail. Darroch also referred to disagreements within the administration, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u00a0distancing himself from Trump\u2019s decision. Pompeo, Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser John Bolton were unable to \u201carticulate why the president was determined to withdraw, beyond his campaign promises,\u201d Darroch reportedly wrote. He said in a second cable that Trump signed a memo to withdraw from the pact \u201cfollowing a typically hyperbolic statement on the nature of the \u2018murderous\u2019 Iranian regime,\u201d according to the newspaper. Darroch wrote the memos in May of last year after a failed trip to the U.S. by then-British foreign secretary Boris Johnson,\u00a0who attempted to talk Trump into sticking with the nuclear agreement. The latest bombshell erupted just as reports emerged that investigators had identified a suspect who they believed leaked the cables to the Mail. Both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt \u2014 Tory rivals in a bid to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister \u2014 criticized a Scotland Yard official for warning journalists that they could face prison for publishing government documents. Hunt said he would \u201cdefend to the hilt the right of the press to publish those leaks if they receive them and judge them to be in the public interest,\u201d The Guardian reported. Johnson said that prosecuting journalists in such a situation\u00a0\u201cwould amount to an infringement on press freedom.\u201d There was no immediate word about the new cable revelations from the White House.",

Heck, if [Obama] was running for president for a third term, I wouldn\u2019t be running.\u201d The presidential hopeful went on to say that Trump \u201cis a guy that my Republican colleagues can\u2019t even criticize when he\u2019s preaching racism.\u201d Booker later added: \u201cThe reality is we have a situation right now where the president is doing things to this country that are perverting our very values and ideals, and talking about what our plans would be, different than the previous president; different than the current president, is not a bad thing.\u201d On Wednesday, Booker went head to head with former Vice President Joe Biden over several issues, getting particularly heated on criminal justice. \u201cIf you want to compare records \u2015 and frankly, I\u2019m shocked that you do \u2015 I am happy to do that,\u201d said Booker at one point. Ahead of the debate, Booker called Biden\u2019s new criminal justice proposal \u201can inadequate solution to what is a raging crisis in our country.\u201d In response, Biden\u2019s team said \u201cthe absurdity of this attack\u201d was \u201cobvious.\u201d Booker went on the offensive with Biden on the issue, calling out the 76-year-old\u2019s past positions. \u201cSince the 1970s, every crime bill, major and minor, has had his name on it,\u201d said Booker. \u201cAnd those are your words, not mine. And this is one of those instances where the house was set on fire and you claimed responsibility for those laws. And you can\u2019t just now come out with a plan to put out that fire.\u201d When Biden responded, he defended himself by saying what he believes about the issue now and called out Booker for not doing enough to reform Newark, New Jersey, when he was mayor. Booker pushed back hard, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in my community that you\u2019re dipping into the Kool-Aid, and you don\u2019t even know the flavor. You are trying to shift the view from what you created.\u201d \u201cThere are people right now in prison for life, for drug offenses because you stood up and used that tough-on-crime phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine. This isn\u2019t about the past. This is about the present right now,\u201d he said.",

The statue, which was unveiled at the Elks Theatre in Rapid City on Saturday, depicts the former president waving one hand while holding hands with his younger daughter, who is also waving her other hand. The design was inspired by a photo of the former president with Sasha Obama at his first inauguration, the Rapid City Journal reported. Barack Obama joins other past U.S. presidents who were memorialized in the downtown area as part of the City of Presidents project that was launched in 2000 under the Rapid City Historic District Tour. The project aims to \u201chonor the legacy of the American presidency\u201d with sculptures positioned along the city\u2019s streets and sidewalks, its website states. Painter and sculptor James Van Nuys, who created the Barack Obama statue, told the Journal he was happy the board chose the design with Barack Obama and Sasha Obama. Dallerie Davis, the project\u2019s co-founder, said the group previously considered depicting Barack Obama waving by himself, before deciding on the final design. \u201cOne of us said, \u2018This is boring.

The Barack Obama sculpture has been designated to sit at the corner of Saint Joseph and 4th Streets in Rapid City, according to the project\u2019s website. Van Nuys told the crowd at the unveiling ceremony on Saturday that he felt a connection to the inauguration image of Barack Obama and Sasha Obama as a father himself, according to a live taping\u00a0by the South Dakota Public Broadcasting radio station. He shared that his daughter was his best friend when she was growing up, so seeing Barack Obama as a \u201cdad with his daughter\u201d held a special meaning for him.",

      "subtitle": "Under Obama, Immigration and Customs Enforcement highlighted stats that those arrested at the border were criminals. Most had broken only immigration laws.",
      "author": "Roque Planas",
      "content": " Throughout Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, he justified the record number of deportations carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement by pointing to the high number of criminals deported. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security,\u201d Obama said in a 2014 speech announcing executive action to shield parents of U.S. citizens from deportation. \u201cFelons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who\u2019s working hard to provide for her kids.\u201d By Obama\u2019s last year in office, publicly released data showed that 58% of deportees had a criminal conviction. More than 99% of deportees met one of the agency\u2019s removal priorities. But data obtained this month by HuffPost through a Freedom of Information Act request reveals the most serious crime committed by more than half of the migrants arrested at the border and tagged as criminal deportees during Obama\u2019s second term was entering the country without authorization. In other words, the difference between those slapped with a criminal immigration offense and those with a clean record was that the Justice Department chose to prosecute them simply for crossing the border. Immigration violations were the most serious crimes committed by tens of thousands of others deported from within the United States and classified as priority removals over that period, despite the fact that their records differed little from non-criminals. Some 2020 Democratic candidates, including Juli\u00e1n Castro and Elizabeth Warren, are pledging to repeal the laws that make this possible. The data underscores the degree to which skyrocketing prosecutions for border-crossing violations over the last decade helped criminalize a vast swath of the deportee population, giving the impression that they posed a greater public security threat than their records indicate. \u201cThey\u2019ve been turning mere immigration law violators into criminal aliens for years in order to inflate the amount of individuals that have been removed under criminal grounds,\u201d immigration attorney Matthew Kolken told HuffPost. \u201cThese were freshly minted criminals. They weren\u2019t committing crimes in the United States.\u201d While convicts made up nearly half of those deported from the border region from 2013 to 2016, the data makes it clear that there weren\u2019t hordes of violent criminals. Traffic violations accounted for the second-highest number of criminal convictions for border deportees, making up 11% to 14% for those years. The data provided by ICE included only broad categories of crime, but previous reporting indicates that driving while intoxicated and driving without a license make up the vast majority of traffic violations on deportees\u2019 records. Only 15% of border deportees under Obama\u2019s second term had a conviction more serious than an immigration or traffic offense. A much smaller percentage committed more serious crimes. Far less than 1% of criminal migrants from the border and interior combined were convicted of a crime involving homicide, for example. Agency statistics include some deaths resulting from negligence or car crashes under that heading. \u201cI\u2019m seeing padding of the number of the people they consider to be criminals with a lot of low-level traffic violations and immigration violations,\u201d said Douglas Massey, a Princeton sociology professor and co-founder of the Mexico Migration Project, after reviewing the data. \u201cThe criminal categories are vastly inflated. The violent crimes are really small in number.\u201d Under Obama, ICE produced end-of-year reports that highlighted the number of criminals the agency deported, trumpeting the high percentage of convicted criminals. Those reports divided deportees removed from the interior from those expelled from the border region largely because the agency considered those arrested while trying to cross into the country a deportation priority regardless of whether they had criminal records. But the agency did not release detailed statistics over the Obama presidency detailing what convictions had marred individual migrants\u2019 records. Instead, ICE used a system of priority categories for those deported from the interior and recorded only whether border deportees had a criminal conviction or not. The sharp rise in prosecutions for border violations that began under George W. Bush\u2019s presidency explains the statistical sleight of hand. In the United States, deportation is handled under civil laws by immigration authorities such as the Border Patrol and ICE. But crossing the border without authorization is also a federal crime, punishable by up to six months in prison. Re-offenders can face felony charges. The law criminalizing illegal entry, authored\u00a0in 1929 by segregationist Sen. Coleman Blease of South Carolina\u00a0and now known as Section 1325, made up a tiny fraction of federal prosecutions by the 1990s. Instead, Border Patrol agents routinely walked unauthorized migrants back to the other side of the border or referred them for deportation proceedings in immigration court. But starting in 2005, the departments of Justice and Homeland Security teamed up to create Operation Streamline, a program to prosecute migrants en masse for jumping the border, in an effort to route Central American migrants into federal jails and create a new deterrent. By 2008, immigration prosecutions had swallowed up half the federal criminal docket \u2015 a statistical trend that held true through Obama\u2019s presidency. President Donald Trump ramped up the system further by enacting a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, mandating all five federal districts that touch the border to focus still more resources on immigration prosecutions. Last year, Trump used the laws criminalizing illegal entry and reentry to carry out his widely reviled experiment with systematic family separations at the border last year. By prosecuting migrant parents traveling with their children, Trump officials channeled them into federal jails, leaving their children in the custody of immigration agencies. Immigrant rights groups and criminal justice reformers have long argued that the laws needlessly criminalize migrants, drive the expansion of privatized prisons and slap a redundant punishment on people who will have to face deportation proceedings regardless of whether they get prosecuted for illegal entry. But advocates have also long suspected that the skyrocketing illegal entry prosecutions helped both the Obama and Trump administrations pad their stats to make the deportee population appear like more of a threat than it actually is. \u201cThey\u2019re creating this illusion that so many people removed have criminal histories, but they\u2019re manufacturing this criminal history by prosecuting them for illegal entry and illegal reentry,\u201d said Zen\u00e9n Jaimes P\u00e9rez, advocacy and communications director for the Texas Civil Rights Project. \u201cWe know that picture starts to fall apart once you start digging into it.\u201d The broad criminal categories identified in the documents released by ICE make it difficult to know with any certainty what convictions had led the agency to classify deportees expelled from inside the country as criminals. It identifies only broad headings like \u201cdangerous drugs,\u201d \u201chomicide\u201d and \u201ctraffic tickets.\u201d Those categories encompass crimes ranging from marijuana possession and driving without a license to drunk driving, drug trafficking and capital murder. But there\u2019s no doubt about what the \u201cimmigration\u201d heading means. Over those four years, illegal entry and reentry accounted for 95% of the most serious criminal convictions for deportees under the \u201cimmigration\u201d heading from 2013 to 2016, according to data previously released to HuffPost. The stats did not distinguish between interior and border removals. The most serious criminal conviction for 21,000 of the migrants deported from within the United States during Obama\u2019s second term was an immigration violation \u2015 about 6.5% of all interior removals. Those convicted of illegal reentry, a felony, would have been classified as a level one priority throughout the period \u2015 the same categorization applied to terrorists and murderers. Thousands of other deportees removed from inside the country during that period had no criminal convictions at all \u2015 ranging from 17.5% in 2013 to 7.6% in Obama\u2019s last year. The number of interior deportees whose most serious offense was an immigration crime dwindled over time. That trend mirrored a drop in deportations from within the country as a whole over Obama\u2019s second term in office as his administration used both prosecutorial discretion and executive action to shield more migrants from deportation. The trend accelerated after the collapse of comprehensive immigration reform talks in the summer of 2014. Former ICE officials defended the agency\u2019s statistical work, contending that they did not intend to mislead the public. They pointed to the series of memos beginning in 2011 that aimed at prioritizing serious criminals, which account for the steady decrease in deportations from inside the country overall. And they insisted that Obama\u2019s policy of focusing on criminal convicts made more efficient use of limited deportation resources than Trump\u2019s policy of casting priorities aside. But the former officials also noted that pushing those priorities down the chain of command took time. And the administration\u2019s focus on deporting people who had been removed in the past meant that people with immigration crimes would show up in agency deportation stats. \u201cWe never felt that the number of criminal removals was padded,\u201d said Peter Vincent, who headed ICE\u2019s legal branch during the Obama administration. \u201cWe were particularly sensitive to any skewing of any statistics that would suggest or imply that the number of criminal removals were higher than in actuality.\u201d The agency struggled with certain crimes that fell into a gray area, like driving under the influence. That traffic offense often remained a priority offense because it could result in death, though prosecutors might use discretion in some cases. But though Vincent remains a vocal supporter of Obama\u2019s prosecutorial discretion policies, he acknowledged that the word \u201ccriminal\u201d implied something more serious than immigration violations \u2015 often the same ones committed by deportees with clean criminal records. \u201cWe did target recent illegal entrants as a way to dissuade individuals from attempting to cross the border,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThat is different from simply categorizing everyone who crosses the border without authorization as a criminal. \u2018Criminal\u2019 has a different meaning and should be used to refer to someone who is a danger to our community or who has been convicted of a serious offense.\u201d John Sandweg, who headed ICE as an acting director under Obama, defended the use of criminal prosecutions at the border, saying that internal reports showed it worked as a more effective deterrent than civil deportation proceedings. But both in the interior of the country and along the border, the agency prioritized deporting people who had been expelled before, whether or not they had been convicted of a crime. The fact that so many people deported from the border had criminal convictions in the United States, whether they were serious or not, showed how many had spent time here in the past. \u201cThe fact that they had been previously convicted for Streamline is interesting \u2015 it\u2019s a fair data point to be thinking of,\u201d Sandweg said. \u201cBut the fact is that they were not deported because they were convicted of a silly 1325. It\u2019s because they were arrested at the border.\u201d Others viewed a clear continuity between the way ICE categorized criminals in agency statistics under Obama and the way Trump vilifies unauthorized migrants by branding them as menacing lawbreakers. Kolken, the immigration lawyer, routinely defends migrants facing prosecution for illegal reentry and the prospect of deportation at his practice in Buffalo, New York, about 1,800 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. To secure a conviction, all the prosecutor needs to do is present evidence that the defendant was deported in the past. In those cases, immigration authorities often reinstate an old order of removal while the criminal immigration charge plays out, Kolken said. Were it not for the illegal reentry charge, he would have an opportunity to try to cancel the old order and win his client a hearing. But when the old removal order gets reinstated, his client loses the opportunity to go before an immigration judge. The vast majority of his clients have no convictions on their records aside from the illegal reentry. The scenario has played out repeatedly over the years, regardless of administration. \u201cThere is very little difference between Trump calling these people \u2018bad hombres\u2019 and Obama calling these people \u2018felons, not families,\u2019\u201d Kolken said. \u201cBoth were attempting to dehumanize this population. Obama was allowed to get away with it. Thankfully, Trump can\u2019t.\u201d",

      "author": "Arthur Delaney",
      "content": " President Donald Trump is weighing his options for executive action on gun control following a pair of mass shootings that killed more than 30 people, according to the White House. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, actually did take executive action on gun control not long after a gunman slaughtered 26 children and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in late 2012.\u00a0And one of Trump\u2019s first actions as president was to undo an Obama regulation that would have blocked some people with mental impairments from buying guns. The rule, which became effective just two days before Trump took office, required the Social Security Administration (SSA) to inform the FBI\u2019s criminal background check system about disabled adults receiving benefits through a representative because a mental impairment limited their ability to manage finances. The Department of Veterans Affairs has long followed a similar policy, which accounts for the bulk of mental incompetency referrals to the background check system from federal agencies, according to the Congressional Research Service. Most of the 4.6 million records prohibiting gun sales due to mental incompetency in the database as of 2016 came from state and local authorities. The SSA\u00a0finalized the rule at the end of 2016, a year in which Obama touted several gun control reforms he\u2019d undertaken without help from Congress.\u00a0\u201cThe gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can\u2019t hold America hostage,\u201d Obama said on Twitter that year. \u201cWe can\u2019t accept this carnage in our communities.\u201d Because Obama pursued the policy involving the SSA through regulation, however, Congress had an easy time overturning it once Trump assumed the White House. Thanks to a special legislative tool called the Congressional Review Act, Republicans undid more than a dozen regulations that had been finalized late in Obama\u2019s second term. Gun control advocates such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence applauded the mental incapacity rule, but its critics included civil liberty and disability advocates. The rule would have restricted firearms sales for roughly 80,000 people, though the restrictions could be appealed. \u201cThe thousands of Americans whose disability benefits are managed by someone else range from young people with depression and financial inexperience to older adults with Down syndrome needing help with a limited budget,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union said in a February 2017 statement. \u201cBut no data \u2015 none \u2015 show that these individuals have a propensity for violence in general or gun violence in particular.\u201d Research shows\u00a0that most mass shooters don\u2019t have severe mental health problems. The man arrested in the killing of 22 people in El Paso on Saturday allegedly wrote that he was doing it to fight an \u201cinvasion\u201d of immigrants, echoing the president\u2019s racist rhetoric. Trump said Wednesday that background checks and mental health policies, rather than restrictions on types of firearms, are his main focus. He told reporters that he\u2019s hoping Republicans and Democrats in Congress can agree on gun control legislation focused on those topics. Administration officials have said they\u2019re also looking at addressing the matters through executive action, though they haven\u2019t specified what they have in mind. Last year, the Trump administration used its executive authority to ban bump stocks that allow semi-automatic rifles to fire as rapidly as illegal machine guns. Bump stocks helped a gunman massacre 58 people in Las Vegas in 2017. White House spokespeople did not reply to a request for comment on whether the president would favor bringing back the restriction on firearms for mentally impaired Social Security recipients. One complication looms for such a move \u2015 federal agencies are not supposed to be able to reissue regulations struck down by the Congressional Review Act. But the Trump administration has already shown it doesn\u2019t care about that restriction. One of the Obama rules Republicans nixed in 2017 had to do with drug testing the jobless; the Trump administration brought it back last year in a tougher form.",

      "author": "Sam Levine",
      "content": " A group backed by President Barack Obama will send experts to train people across the country on the ins-and-outs of redistricting as part an effort to fight excessive partisan gerrymandering. The new effort, called Redistricting U, comes as states are gearing up for the next round of redistricting, which will take place in 2021. The program will launch with trainings in dozens of cities across 10 states this fall aimed at teaching people the basics of the redistricting process. Organizers also want to connect gerrymandering to \u201cpocketbook issues\u201d and hope people will leave the trainings motivated to get involved in the redistricting process in their states, said Saumya Narechania, director of advocacy and campaign manager of All On The Line, the part of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC) that will lead the effort. \u201cThe movement for fair maps will determine the course of progress on every issue we care about for the next decade. And we can\u2019t wait to begin organizing when the redistricting process starts in 2021. We need to build this movement from the ground up \u2014 right now,\u201d Obama said in a statement. Obama has been involved in efforts to limit excessive partisan gerrymandering since leaving office. Last year he folded his political group, Organizing for Action, into the NDRC, a redistricting-focused group led by Eric Holder, who served as attorney general for most of Obama\u2019s presidency. The redistricting process, which takes just once per decade, is expected to be a brutal brawl for partisan advantage. The United States Supreme Court ruled in June that there were no constitutional limits on how severely states could manipulate district lines to benefit political parties. For decades, redistricting in many places has been done behind closed doors, with lawmakers quietly negotiating deals to get the districts they want. Emails from lawmakers made public in litigation in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio, among other places, have shed light on just how unsavory those negotiations are. In Michigan, for example, a Republican staffer wrote happily about cramming \u201cDem garbage\u201d into four districts. Advocates have long struggled to get the public interested in redistricting, seen as a wonky, boring and complicated issue. But Obama and NDRC\u2019s decision to focus on the issue is a signal in itself of how the issue has exploded in recent years. In 2011, Republicans recognized the potential to use the redistricting process to lock in their political advantage for a decade and successfully executed a targeted campaign to do just that. The National Republican Redistricting Trust (NRRT), a GOP group focused on redistricting led by former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, mocked the new effort in a tweet. The group recently sued to block a new independent panel in Michigan from drawing district lines. The NDRC has dismissed the GOP-led criticism, noting that it has championed proposals with bipartisan support. \u201cI\u2019m not really that focused on what the NRRT is saying about us or our program,\u201d Narechania said. \u201cWe are hyperfocused on building a fair process and making sure that we are concentrating on places where redistricting reform gives power back to the people, not to politicians, not to the folks who are camped out in lobbyist offices who are drawing the lines in secret.\u201d \u201cThe whole point of All On The Line is to take this process and make it as transparent as possible. And if transparency is something that folks are afraid of, then I think the question is why is that?\u201d he said.",

He put out a statement Monday, after mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, claimed at least 31 lives and injured dozens more over the weekend. During his presidency, Obama spoke after more than\u00a0a dozen mass shootings, and memorably wept as he gave a speech\u00a0in the aftermath of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. \u201cNo other developed nation tolerates the levels of gun violence that we do,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cEvery time this happens, we\u2019re told that tougher gun laws won\u2019t stop all murders. \u2026 But the evidence shows that they can stop some killings.\u201d In El Paso, the shooter reportedly penned an anti-immigrant manifesto and was motivated by racist, white supremacist ideology. In his statement, Obama called for both law enforcement and internet platforms to increase efforts to reduce the influence of hate groups in radicalizing troubled individuals. He called on the country to \u201csend a clarion call and behave with the values of tolerance and diversity that should be the hallmark of our democracy.\u201d Though he did not name anyone in particular, much of what Obama condemned was speech used by his presidential successor, Donald Trump. \u201cWe should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments,\u201d the former president wrote. Trump\u00a0has faced heavy criticism for his own role in promoting the anti-immigrant rhetoric that the El Paso shooter espoused. In a statement Monday, Trump condemned white supremacy and racism, but did not acknowledge how his own comments had fueled such beliefs. \u201cSuch language isn\u2019t new \u2014 it\u2019s been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history,\u201d Obama wrote. \u201cIt has no place in our politics and our public life.

      "content": " Following a contentious debate among Democratic White House contenders Wednesday, a number of party leaders aren\u2019t thrilled that some of the candidates focused on attacking former President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy as a way to challenge Joe Biden. In one of the debate\u2019s\u00a0hottest exchanges, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey called out the former vice president \u2015 the frontrunner in the Democratic nomination race \u2015 for repeatedly using Obama\u2019s name to shield himself from criticism directed his way on issues like criminal justice and immigration. \u201cMr. vice president, you can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Booker said, referring to Biden\u2019s \u2015 and Obama\u2019s \u2015 record on immigration, which saw a record number of undocumented immigrants deported during their eight-year administration. \u201cYou invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can\u2019t do it when it\u2019s convenient and then dodge it when it\u2019s not.\u201d Biden defended himself by noting Obama\u2019s decision to select him as his running mate, saying, \u201cBarack Obama knew exactly who I was.\u201d Also taking Biden to task on the deportation figures was Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2015 a particularly striking moment, since the Texan served in Obama\u2019s administration as secretary of housing and urban development. Biden spotlighted that, responding to Castro,\u00a0\u201cThe secretary, we sat together in many meetings. I never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary. Castro retorted: \u201cIt looks like one of us has learned from the lessons of the past and one of us hasn\u2019t.\u201d Polls show Obama remains a popular figure among all voters, with approval ratings easily outstripping those for President Donald Trump.\u00a0And among Democrats, Obama remains by far the most admired politician. Booker, in comments to CNN\u00a0on Thursday, insisted it wasn\u2019t a negative to reconsider part of the record of the Obama administration as part of the process of choosing the next Democratic presidential nominee. Democrats are \u201chaving an honest conversation about an administration that was incredible,\u201d Booker said.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure (if) Barack Obama was sitting here ... He will tell you, \u2018I made some mistakes.\u2019\u201d But several of Booker\u2019s Democratic Senate colleagues expressed concern about the tactic, arguing it would needlessly expose divisions in the party and take the focus off of Trump and his administration. \u201cI think attacking President Obama is bad policy and bad politics,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Thursday. Of Biden\u2019s tenure as vice president, Blumenthal added: \u201cHe owns it, for better or worse. But he should be proud of it.\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois also suggested the Democratic race should be marked by a more hands-off approach toward Obama. \u201cYou can disagree with him, and I have, but the bottom line is ... he did an extraordinary job, and he should be given that recognition by those that are running for the presidency.\u201d Others who watched the debate expressed similar sentiments, including longtime Washington-based political analyst Stuart Rothenberg: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York urged his party\u2019s White House contenders to train their sights firmly on Trump. \u201cI think President Obama is a very popular figure in America to this day because he did a very good job. Did he accomplish everything? No,\u201d Schumer told reporters on Thursday, \u201cYou compare the Obama administration to this administration \u2015 it\u2019s night and day.\u201d Veteran Republican political consultant John Weaver \u2015 a fierce Trump critic \u2015was blunter:",

We know that when we give girls a chance to learn, they\u2019ll seize it.\u201d In light of International Day of Charity on Thursday, the 55-year-old stressed in her caption that when girls have the opportunity to learn, \u201cour whole world benefits.\u201d \u201cGirls who go to school have healthier children, higher salaries, lower poverty rates, and they can even help boost their entire nation\u2019s economy,\u201d she wrote.

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0defended former President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration record on Saturday, even as he conceded that they both learned from the failure of their tough approach early on in which they tried to win over Republican lawmakers. Biden was one of 19 Democratic presidential candidates to speak at a candidate forum hosted by the public-sector labor union AFSCME in Las Vegas on Saturday. Jon Ralston of The Nevada Independent, who moderated the discussion alongside HuffPost\u2019s Amanda Terkel, asked Biden to elaborate on how he feels about the Obama administration\u2019s record volume of deportations of undocumented immigrants in its first term. \u201cWe learned a lot in the process,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhen the president got elected, everything landed on his desk but locusts. We were about to go into a depression.\u201d He went on to imply that the Obama administration employed a tough approach to border enforcement and unauthorized immigration partly in the misplaced hope that it would lay the groundwork for a bipartisan immigration reform bill. \u201cWe thought at the beginning we might be able to get a more rational approach to the way we dealt with, for example, immigration,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBy the middle of the term, it was clear that wasn\u2019t going to happen and things changed.\u201d The changes the administration implemented included executive orders aimed at protecting undocumented immigrants who arrived as children \u2015 those known as Dreamers \u2015 and their parents, the former vice president noted. Ralston pressed Biden to reveal any details about how he might have advocated against the deportations behind closed doors during Obama\u2019s first term. But Biden reiterated what he said during the presidential debate on Wednesday night \u2015 that he does not reveal his discussions with Obama behind closed doors. \u201cThe focus was on deporting felons,\u201d Biden said, adding, \u201cComparing what he did to what Trump did is just absolutely off the wall \u2015 it\u2019s just not true.\u201d (No Democratic candidate has actually compared Obama\u2019s policies to those of President Donald Trump.) In a subsequent exchange with Terkel, Biden confirmed that he does not support changing unauthorized border crossing from a crime to a civil penalty. Doing so \u201cwill be an invitation\u201d for more undocumented immigrants to take their chances by just showing up at the border, he argued. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re trying to do is keep parents in difficult circumstances from giving their children to a coyote\u201d to transport them to the border. Since the candidate forum was hosted by AFSCME, which is celebrating the passage of a Nevada law granting state workers collective bargaining rights, much of Saturday\u2019s discussion focused on the priorities of union workers. Terkel asked Biden how he responded to criticism of the Obama administration for not pushing harder to pass the Employee Free Choice Act. The bill would have made it easier for workers to unionize by ratifying their majority through card check and thereby avoiding employer intimidation. \u201cWe pressed and pressed,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, there were other things happening as well.\u201d He went on to attribute it to the Republican takeover of the House in the 2010 midterm elections, even though most of the criticism faults the Obama administration for failing to pass it in its first two years in power, when Democrats controlled both branches of government. \u201cWe did not have a Democratic Congress to be able to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would.\u201d",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden at a campaign event on Friday compared the political and social unrest of the late 1960s to the current political climate, asking audience members to imagine what might have happened if President Barack Obama had been assassinated. \u201cImagine what would have happened if, God forbid, Barack Obama had been assassinated after becoming the de facto nominee. What would have happened in America?\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate said, according to The New York Times. Biden, 76, appeared to be engaging in a rhetorical exercise aimed at impressing upon younger voters the impact of the back-to-back assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Friday\u2019s event took place on the campus of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. Several dozen high school and college students were in the audience, according to the Times. He also attempted a stale compliment to the women in the room, suggesting they wouldn\u2019t want to admit their age by recalling events from the late \u201960s. Biden, the current front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said: I think of where we are at the moment. You know, none of you men are old enough, uh, women are old enough, but a couple of you guys are old enough to remember. I graduated in 1968. Everybody before me was: Drop out, go to Haight-Ashbury, don\u2019t trust anybody over 30, everybody not get involved. I\u2019m serious. I know no woman will shake their head and acknowledge it, but you guys know what I\u2019m talking about. Right? But then what happened? Dr. Ki\u2014 I only have two political heroes. I have one hero who was my dad, but I have two political heroes were Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy. My senior semester, they were both shot and killed. Imagine what would have happened if, God forbid, Barack Obama had been assassinated after becoming the de facto nominee. What would have happened in America? The comments came days after Biden, during a speech in Iowa, mistakenly said Kennedy and King were killed in the 1970s. On Friday, the former vice president said those assassinations sparked his own political awakening in his 20s. \u201cUnless I\u2019m mistaken, Donald Trump did for your generation what the loss of two of my heroes did for mine,\u201d he said to the students in the audience. \u201cWhat they did was make you realize, my God, we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d",

At a press conference in France on Monday, Trump said: \u201cPresident Obama was pure and simply outsmarted. They took Crimea during his term. That was not a good thing. It could have been stopped, with the right, whatever, it could have been stopped.\u201d He added that he\u2019d \u201cmost certainly\u201d invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to the group\u2019s next summit. Trump did not describe how he thought Obama should have prevented the annexation of Crimea, but said that if it had happened under his watch, he would have admitted that he had made a mistake and apologized. Of course, Trump is known for being defiantly unapologetic.\u00a0He\u2019s also known to have a penchant for\u00a0insulting the intelligence of Black people and women. Prior to his trip to France,\u00a0Trump also said\u00a0Obama \u201cwanted Russia out\u201d of the G-8 because Putin \u201coutsmarted him,\u201d suggesting the decision was solely motivated by ego. In reality, a majority of G-8 member countries \u2014 not just the United States \u2014 decided to suspend Russia from the group in 2014 because it had violated international law barring the acquisition of another country\u2019s territory through coercion or force. \u201cTo do so violates the principles upon which the international system is built. We condemn the illegal referendum held in Crimea in violation of Ukraine\u2019s constitution,\u201d Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the U.S. said in a 2014 statement. \u201cWe also strongly condemn Russia\u2019s illegal attempt to annex Crimea in contravention of international law and specific international obligations.\u201d At the time, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\u00a0dismissed Russia\u2019s departure from the G-8 as no big deal. French President Emmanuel Macron, who is hosting this year\u2019s summit, has expressed support for Russia\u2019s readmission to the multinational group, but only if it helps resolve the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Trump said Monday that he wasn\u2019t sure whether Putin would accept an invitation to return to the group, suggesting the Russian leader also had a bruised ego. \u201cHe\u2019s a proud person. Would I invite him, I would certainly invite him. Whether or not he could come, psychologically, I think that\u2019s a tough thing for him to do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a G-8, now it\u2019s a G-7, and you invite the person that was thrown out really by President Obama, and really because he got outsmarted.\u201d",

Her writing was not just beautiful but meaningful \u2014 a challenge to our conscience and a call to greater empathy,\u201d he said in a statement. Time is no match for Toni Morrison. In her writing, she sometimes toyed with it, warping and creasing it, bending it to her masterful will. In her life\u2019s story, too, she treated time nontraditionally. A child of the Great Migration who\u2019d lifted up new, more diverse voices in American literature as an editor, Toni didn\u2019t publish her first novel until she was 39 years old. From there followed an ascendant career\u2014a Pulitzer, a Nobel, and so much more\u2014and with it, a fusion of the African American story within the American story. Toni Morrison was a national treasure. Her writing was not just beautiful but meaningful\u2014a challenge to our conscience and a call to greater empathy. She was as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. And so even as Michelle and I mourn her loss and send our warmest sympathies to her family and friends, we know that her stories\u2014that our stories\u2014will always be with us, and with those who come after, and on and on, for all time. As president, Obama awarded the trailblazing author the Presidential Medal of Freedom\u00a0in 2012, honoring her career in centering the lives and histories of African Americans. \u201cAs a single mother working at a publishing company by day, she would carve out a little time in the evening to write, often with her two sons pulling on her hair and tugging at her earrings. Once, a baby spit up on her tablet so she wrote around it. Circumstances may not have been ideal, but the words that came out were magical,\u201d Obama said at the ceremony. \u201cToni Morrison\u2019s prose brings us that kind of moral and emotional intensity that few writers ever attempt.\u00a0 From \u2018Song of Solomon\u2019 to \u2018Beloved,\u2019 Toni reaches us deeply, using a tone that is lyrical, precise, distinct, and inclusive,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe believes that language \u2018arcs toward the place where meaning might lie.\u2019 The rest of us are lucky to be following along for the ride.\u201d \u201cI remember reading \u2018Song of Solomon\u2019 when I was a kid and not just trying to figure out how to write, but also how to be and how to think,\u201d he added later, referring to her 1977 novel. Obama also cited Morrison while reflecting on his favorite books during an interview with then-New York Times\u00a0book critic Michiko Kakutani, shortly before he left office in 2017. \u201cI think Toni Morrison\u2019s writings \u2014 particularly \u2018Song of Solomon\u2019 is a book I think of when I imagine people going through hardship,\u201d he said. \u201cThat it\u2019s not just pain, but there\u2019s joy and glory and mystery.\u201d Former first lady Michelle Obama has also mentioned the book as a source of inspiration. In 2018, she told The New York Times\u00a0that she has read the novel three times. \u201cI rarely have time to reread books, but \u2018Song of Solomon,\u2019 every time I pick it up, I\u2019m pulled into that story,\u201d she told\u00a0Today show host Jenna Bush Hager\u00a0earlier this year. Morrison, best known for the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \u201cBeloved,\u201d died Monday night\u00a0in New York City of unspecified causes, her publisher, Knopf, said Tuesday. In 1993, she became the first Black woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. In a rare step for her, Morrison endorsed Obama in 2008,\u00a0writing in a letter\u00a0that she chose the then-Illinois senator over his primary opponent, Hillary Clinton, for his \u201ccreative imagination,\u201d calling him \u201cthe man for this time.\u201d In thinking carefully about the strengths of the candidates, I stunned myself when I came to the following conclusion: that in addition to keen intelligence, integrity and a rare authenticity, you exhibit something that has nothing to do with age, experience, race or gender and something I don\u2019t see in other candidates. That something is a creative imagination which coupled with brilliance equals wisdom. It is too bad if we associate it only with gray hair and old age. Or if we call searing vision na\u00efvet\u00e9. Or if we believe cunning is insight. Or if we settle for finessing cures tailored for each ravaged tree in the forest while ignoring the poisonous landscape that feeds and surrounds it. Wisdom is a gift; you can\u2019t train for it, inherit it, learn it in a class, or earn it in the workplace\u2013that access can foster the acquisition of knowledge, but not wisdom. In 2012,\u00a0she told The Guardian\u00a0that attending Obama\u2019s first inauguration in 2009 was \u201cthe first time she felt truly American.\u201d \u201cI felt very powerfully patriotic when I went to the inauguration of Barack Obama. I felt like a kid. The marines and the flag, which I never look at \u2014 all of a sudden it looked \u2026 nice. Worthy,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt only lasted a couple of hours. But I was amazed, that music that I really don\u2019t like \u2014 God Bless America is a dumb song; I mean it\u2019s not beautiful. But I really felt that, for that little moment.\u201d",

Castro has proposed to decriminalize illegal border crossings, making it a civil violation and preventing future administrations from separating families at the border. \u201cPresident Obama was trying and that administration made adjustments and improved on immigration,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cHowever, Trump has weaponized a certain section of the law to inflict cruelty on migrant children and their parents, so there are lessons we can learn from this.\u201d After his time was up, Castro told reporters backstage that he feels the news media was playing into the Biden campaign\u2019s hands by framing his criticism of the vice president as an attack on the Obama administration. The Democratic primary debate on Wednesday heated up when several candidates, including Castro, piled on Biden over the record number of deportations made under the Obama administration. Biden suggested that Castro\u2019s plan to decriminalize border crossings was unnecessary, to which Castro replied: \u201cIt looks like one of us has learned from the lessons of the past and one of us hasn\u2019t.\u201d",

      "content": " CNN host Van Jones criticized Hillary Clinton for her recent remarks suggesting Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) was \u201ca favorite of the Russians\u201d in the 2020 presidential race. \u201cShe\u2019s playing a very dangerous game,\u201d Jones said during a segment\u00a0on \u201cErin Burnett Out Front\u201d on Friday. \u201cHillary Clinton, if you\u2019re concerned about disinformation \u2015 what the Russians do, is they spread disinformation and get us divided against each other \u2015 that is what just happened. Just throw out some information ... disinformation, smear somebody,\u201d he continued. Jones\u2019 remarks were in response to Clinton\u2019s Thursday appearance on the podcast \u201cCampaign HQ With David Plouffe.\u201d During a\u00a0conversation about the 2020 election with Plouffe, former senior adviser to Barack Obama, Clinton appeared to single out Gabbard, before unleashing accusations about\u00a0Jill Stein\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. (Stein slammed Clinton\u2019s comments on Twitter.) \u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary ... and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d\u00a0Clinton said during the interview. She continued, \u201cShe\u2019s a favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d Though many interpreted Clinton\u2019s \u201cgrooming\u201d comment as referring to the Russians, Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill said on Twitter on Friday that the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was referencing the Republican Party. Before making her \u201cgrooming\u201d remarks, Clinton and Plouffe were sharing their thoughts on President Donald Trump\u2019s election strategy. The former secretary of state did not reference Gabbard by name in that conversation, but when Merrill was asked by NBC News this week to confirm Gabbard was her target, he replied: \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d Gabbard, who has repeatedly said she would not run as a third-party candidate\u00a0if she loses the Democratic nomination, fired back at Clinton\u2019s claims\u00a0in a series of tweets on Friday. The presidential hopeful and Iraq War veteran similarly criticized The New York Times on Tuesday\u2019s Ohio debate stage after it reported that Russian news media had frequently mentioned her. Elsewhere in the CNN segment with Burnett, Jones, who referred to Clinton as a\n\u201dlegend,\u201d suggested there was a \u201cbackstory\u201d to the Gabbard-Clinton-Russia debacle. He pointed to Gabbard\u2019s decision to resign as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president. \u201cIt\u2019s been payback hell ever since,\u201d Jones charged. He later added, \u201cI do not want somebody of her [Clinton\u2019s] stature to legitimate these kind of attacks against anybody \u2015 if you\u2019ve got real evidence, come forward with it, but if you\u2019re just going to smear people casually on podcast, you\u2019re playing right into the Russians\u2019 hands.\u201d Watch the entire CNN segment here.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration is revoking an Obama-era regulation that shielded many U.S. wetlands and streams from pollution but was opposed by developers and farmers who said it hurt economic development and infringed on property rights. Even before the official announcement, scheduled for later Thursday, environmental groups blasted the administration\u2019s action, the latest in a series of\u00a0moves to roll back environmental protections\u00a0put into place under former President Barack Obama. The Waters of the United States rule being revoked defines which waterways are subject to federal regulation. \u201cThis action officially ends an egregious power grab and sets the stage for a new rule that will provide much-needed regulatory certainty for farmers, home builders and property owners nationwide,\u201d Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler and R.D. James, assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, wrote in a column published Thursday by the Des Moines Register. Since enactment of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the federal government has gone beyond protection of navigable waterways and their major tributaries to assert jurisdiction over \u201cisolated ponds and channels that flow only after it rains,\u201d the officials wrote. \u201cAs the definition expanded, so too has Washington\u2019s power over private property and the states\u2019 traditional authority to regulate their land and water resources,\u201d they said. President Donald Trump had ordered the agencies to develop a replacement policy that has a more restrictive definition of protected wetlands and streams, leaving fewer subject to federal protection. Environmentalists say the move would leave millions of Americans with less safe drinking water and allow damage of wetlands that prevent flooding, filter pollutants and provide habitat for a multitude of fish, waterfowl and other wildlife. The Natural Resources Defense Council said the Trump administration\u2019s action would be challenged in court. \u201cThe Clean Water Rule represented solid science and smart public policy,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWhere it has been enforced, it has protected important waterways and wetlands, providing certainty to all stakeholders.\u201d But Don Parrish, congressional relations director for the American Farm Bureau Federation, says the 2015 regulation that extended federal protection to many U.S. wetlands and waterways created uncertainty about where farmers could cultivate land. \u201cIt would be great if farmers didn\u2019t have to hire an army of consultants and lawyers just to be able to farm,\u201d he said. Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota says the Obama rule was \u201can unconstitutional power grab that did nothing to advance good water management.\u201d The question of which waters are covered under the Clean Water Act has inspired decades of lawsuits and congressional debate. A sharply divided Supreme Court in 2006 produced three differing opinions, leading the Obama administration to craft its rule. It provided federal oversight to upstream tributaries and headwaters, including wetlands, ponds, lakes and streams that can affect the quality of navigable waters. The regulation drew quick legal challenges. Courts prevented it from taking effect in parts of the U.S. Betsy Southerland, who was director of science and technology in EPA\u2019s Office of Water during the Obama administration, said repealing its regulation would create further regulatory confusion. \u201cThis repeal is a victory for land developers, oil and gas drillers and miners who will exploit that ambiguity to dredge and fill small streams and wetlands that were protected from destruction by the 2015 rule because of their critical impact on national water quality,\u201d Southerland said.",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " HOUSTON \u2015 Wading through throngs of students during a surprise visit at a historically Black university here on Friday, Joe Biden felt the love from a contingent of voters he doesn\u2019t see often at his campaign events: young people. \u201cIt\u2019s Uncle Joe!\u201d one teenager shouted to a friend as the 76-year-old former vice president made his way around the student center at Texas Southern University, which was established in 1946 when Texas was still a segregated state. Biden was the only candidate who met with students there after last week\u2019s Democratic presidential primary debate, which took place on the campus a day prior. He spent approximately 45 minutes shaking hands, posing for selfies, and giving hugs to star-struck students. Judging the reaction from among some in the crowd, one would have guessed it was actually former President Barack Obama making the rounds. \u201cI think if there\u2019s a Democrat that has a chance of winning, it\u2019s definitely Biden. Everybody wants another Obama and he\u2019s the closest thing we can get,\u201d said Chynna Barcass, a junior at TSU who is studying political science. Obama\u2019s political rise, though, was fueled in large part by young people. So far, polls have consistently shown Biden supporters to be older \u2015 a trend one can\u2019t help but notice at his rallies and town halls, which have tended to be predominantly filled by voters over the age of 60. Biden is particularly popular among older, more conservative African Americans, a source of his political strength in early primary states like South Carolina. But young Black students at TSU said they liked the former vice president, too, citing his association with Obama, who remains overwhelmingly popular among the Democratic electorate. Biden has leaned heavily into his relationship with the former president during the campaign, invoking his name repeatedly and using his legacy as a shield when faced with criticism by rivals for the Democratic nomination. Just hours before the debate last week, he released a video touting Obama administration achievements and showing him and the former president exchanging high-fives. \u201cBarack Obama was a great president. We don\u2019t say that enough\u200b,\u201d Biden wrote in a tweet accompanying the video. It\u2019s clear why Biden\u2019s campaign is doing this \u2015 it\u2019s one of his best tools in winning over not just older Black voters, but younger ones too. However, there is evidence young minority voters are more open to considering other candidates in the race, especially those who have proposed significantly more liberal policies dealing with health care and education. \u201cMy mom likes [Biden], but I don\u2019t know. I feel like I want somebody different, somebody new,\u201d said Ardis Thomas, a music and entertainment major who is leaning toward backing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) because of his plan to cancel all $1.6 trillion of U.S. student loan debt. Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, like his unsuccessful 2016 bid, is made up of more younger voters in general. A third of Sanders\u2019 coalition is currently composed of voters under the age of 29, compared to just 9 percent of Biden\u2019s, according to a survey conducted by Morning Consult last month. \u201cA lot of people in the minority groups ... hear some of the things\u00a0[Bernie is]\u00a0saying and just completely get excited. I think that\u2019s how he\u2019s getting our vote,\u201d argued Barcass. She added that while the idea of canceling all student debt in the U.S. sounded nice, it was nevertheless \u201cunrealistic.\u201d Other candidates named by students at TSU as someone they are considering supporting in the primary included Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who narrowly lost his bid to oust Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during the 2018 midterm election. \u201cI like Beto. He\u2019s just really for the people,\u201d said Aisha Lewis, a TSU freshman who is studying psychology. Texas is home to one of the largest African American populations in the country. Houston, in particular, has one of the most rapidly growing and diverse communities in the nation. The recent wave of Republican retirements in the House from Texas has ignited Democratic hopes about turning the state blue in the coming years. Getting young voters, who are a key segment of the Democratic electorate, enthused and out to the polls was a successful strategy for Obama in 2008 and 2012. It\u2019s not clear yet if Biden will be able to replicate his success on that front. The former vice president\u2019s campaign recently launched a \u201cStudents for Biden\u201d group focused on training and recruiting organizers at college campuses, including HBCUs, but they\u2019ve lagged behind the efforts of other candidates when it comes to drawing young voters. Biden\u2019s campaign has acknowledged that he has to do to better at appealing to the demographic.\u00a0One Biden adviser, however, argued during a press briefing last week that it is other candidates who are actually at a disadvantage in the primary due to their difficulties attracting older voters, who \u201ctend to show up in slightly greater numbers sometimes and are regarded often as more dependable voters.\u201d It\u2019s true that Democratic primary voters tend to be older. Turning out voters under the age of 30 has historically been key to Democrats in winning the general election, however. In one of the most notable moments in Thursday\u2019s presidential debate, former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro targeted Biden with a sharp attack, suggesting that Biden\u2019s memory was failing him. The broadside echoed concerns by other candidates in the race about the former vice president\u2019s age and mental acuity,\u00a0especially after highly publicized verbal slip-ups. (Warren and Sanders are also both in their 70s.)\u00a0Biden\u2019s campaign dismissed it as a \u201ccheap shot,\u201d and that characterization has been echoed by others in the media. But it was not an issue brought up by students at TSU, who said they were looking for a presidential candidate with their interests at heart first and foremost. \u201cA lot of candidates think that age matters, but if you\u2019re capable of getting things done, I don\u2019t think it does,\u201d said TSU College Democrats President Tyler Smith. Isaiah Thornton, who is studying journalism, agreed. \u201cI feel like a lot of young kids like older people who know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said.",

On Sunday he said the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded,\u201d waiting to \u201chear from the Kingdom\u201d about who was responsible for the attack Saturday on Saudi oil facilities. As it turns out, the U.S. didn\u2019t wait for \u201cthe Kingdom\u201d but instead informed the Saudis on Monday that Iran was responsible for the attack. But the Saudis said American officials\u00a0failed to provide enough proof that Iran was responsible, The Wall Street Journal reported. Iran has denied responsibility. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the attack was an act of self-defense by the Yemeni Houthi rebels in response to being bombed by the Saudis.

For decades before Trump was president, he blasted Saudi Arabia for taking advantage of its relationship with America and once mocked Obama for bowing at a meeting with the Saudi king.

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In less than three years, President Donald Trump has named more former lobbyists to Cabinet-level posts than his most recent predecessors did in eight, putting a substantial amount of oversight in the hands of people with ties to the industries they\u2019re regulating. The Cabinet choices are another sign that Trump\u2019s populist pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d is a catchy campaign slogan but not a serious attempt to change the way Washington works. Instead of staring down \u201cthe unholy alliance of lobbyists and donors and special interests\u201d as Trump recently declared, the influence industry has flourished during his administration. The amount spent in 2019 on lobbying the U.S. government is on pace to match or exceed last year\u2019s total of $3.4 billion, the most since 2010, according to the political money website Open Secrets. Trump also has pulled in hefty contributions from industries with business before his administration, and his hotel near the White House has been a magnet for lobbyists and foreign interests since he was elected. \u201cAn administration staffed by former industry lobbyists will almost certainly favor industry over the general public, because that\u2019s the outlook they\u2019re bringing to the job,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at the think tank New America and author of the book \u201cThe Business of America is Lobbying.\u201d Former lobbyists run the Defense and Interior departments, Environmental Protection Agency and office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The acting Labor secretary, Pat Pizzella, is an ex-lobbyist and Trump\u2019s pick to run the department, Eugene Scalia, also is an ex-lobbyist. Scalia\u2019s confirmation hearing before a GOP-controlled Senate committee is scheduled for Thursday and Democrats are expected to grill him on his long record of opposing federal regulations . A seventh ex-lobbyist, Dan Coats, resigned as Trump\u2019s intelligence chief in August. President Barack Obama had five former lobbyists in his Cabinet during two terms in office and President George W. Bush had three, also during eight years in the White House, according to lobbying and foreign agent disclosure records. The review was limited to the Trump, Obama and Bush administrations because prior to 1995 there was no central database of federal lobbying registrations and the law was hazy about who was supposed to register. Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order that revoked an Obama directive prohibiting lobbyists from being appointed to a post at a federal agency they\u2019d lobbied within the last two years. While this \u201ccooling off\u201d period was cast aside, Trump\u2019s order continued to bar for two years lobbyists-turned-government-employees from participating in particular matters that they\u2019d lobbied on during the two preceding years. \u201cWithout the cooling off period, these Cabinet heads appear to be serving their former employers\u2019 and clients\u2019 special interests,\u201d said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump\u2019s Cabinet includes the heads of the 15 executive departments and seven other senior-level posts, such as EPA administrator and director of national intelligence. Obama\u2019s Cabinet had the same number of members and Bush\u2019s Cabinet had two fewer. Scalia, the Labor Department nominee, has spent much of his career as a partner in the Washington office of the Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher firm, where he ran up a string of victories in court cases on behalf of business interests challenging labor and financial regulations. Scalia, the son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, served for a year as the Labor Department\u2019s top lawyer during the George W. Bush administration. His financial disclosure report lists 49 clients who paid him $5,000 or more for legal services, including e-cigarette giant Juul Labs, Facebook, Walmart and Bank of America. Disclosure records show Scalia was registered in 2010 and 2011 to lobby for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Pizzella has been the acting secretary since Alexander Acosta resigned the post in July amid renewed criticism of how, as a federal prosecutor, he handled a 2008 secret plea deal with wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Pizzella lobbied for clients that ranged from Microsoft Corp. to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. He also worked on several accounts with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, although Pizzella was never accused of any misconduct or wrongdoing. Obama chose Pizzella for a GOP seat on the Federal Labor Relations Authority and he was an assistant Labor secretary during the George W. Bush administration. Two Trump Cabinet officials, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler, have been accused by congressional Democrats and public interest groups of failing to honor their ethics pledges. Both Bernhardt and Wheeler, backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have played leading roles in the administration\u2019s rollback of environmental regulations. They also both worked at the agency they now lead during prior administrations. Interior\u2019s inspector general launched an investigation of Bernhardt earlier this year after receiving seven separate ethics allegations against him. A complaint filed by the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center alleged that shortly after joining the department in August 2017 Bernhardt became involved in matters that were the focus of his lobbying for California\u2019s Westlands Water District that lasted until mid-November 2016. Westlands has federal contracts to provide irrigation water to 700 family-owned farms in the fertile San Joaquin Valley. The complaint said Bernhardt had \u201clobbied on discrete provisions of a law directing Interior to maximize water supplies to his clients, and to minimize Endangered Species Act protections in that region.\u201d Then, after joining Interior, Bernhardt breached his ethics pledge by directing government officials under him \u201cto advance the particular matters he had previously lobbied on,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cIt is very hard to tell where Bernhardt\u2019s lobbying career ended and where his public service begins,\u201d said Brendan Fischer, director of the Campaign Legal Center\u2019s federal reform program. An Interior spokesman said in a statement, \u201cSecretary Bernhardt is and always has been committed to upholding his ethical responsibilities, and he has fully complied with those obligations.\u201d Thomas Birmingham, Westlands\u2019 general manager, said the agency is actually disadvantaged with Bernhardt as secretary because he\u2019s not been able to engage with him as he did past Interior secretaries, like Ken Salazar and Sally Jewell. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Mr. Bernhardt has done or has not done at Interior,\u201d Birmingham said. Wheeler worked as a lobbyist for eight years and his more than 20 different clients included coal magnate Bob Murray, who pushed hard on the Trump administration to grant a series of breaks for the sagging domestic coal industry. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d Betsy Monseu, CEO of the American Coal Council, said of Wheeler. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to see the regulatory reform agenda moving forward.\u201d But Canter\u2019s organization, known as CREW, urged the EPA inspector general earlier this year to investigate whether Wheeler broke his ethics pledge. Among the allegations, CREW said Wheeler had participated in the easing of standards for storing coal ash in 2018 even though he had lobbied on those regulations the year before for Murray Energy. The inspector general\u2019s office declined to say if it had open an investigation, directing a reporter to file a Freedom of Information Act request. An EPA statement called CREW\u2019s complaint \u201cbaseless and just flat out false.\u201d It said Wheeler works closely with career EPA ethics officials and abides by all ethics requirements. The Pentagon\u2019s top official, Mark Esper, spent seven years lobbying for defense industry juggernaut Raytheon, a company that stands to gain handsomely from Trump\u2019s push to boost military spending by billions of dollars. The company closed out 2018 by hitting a record $27.1 billion in net sales, up nearly seven percent from the $25.3 billion the year before. Esper, who was secretary of the Army when Trump chose him to be defense secretary, faced opposition from only a handful of Democrats and he was confirmed in July by a 90-8 margin. As Army secretary, Esper hasn\u2019t participated in Raytheon-related matters under the terms of an ethics agreement that runs through this November. After that, Esper told Pentagon ethics officials that he will continue to avoid Raytheon issues unless his participation as defense secretary is determined to be essential. Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade Representative, lobbied primarily for steel companies between 1999 and 2003. Beginning in 2004, he represented just one company, U.S. Steel, which paid his firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, $3.2 million over a seven-year period. ___ Associated Press researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report.",

      "subtitle": "The former housing secretary did not hold back against former Vice President Joe Biden at the Democratic presidential debate in Houston.",
      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro took full advantage of his moment on the national stage at the Democratic debate Thursday night to unload on former Vice President Joe Biden, accusing him of betraying the positive aspects of President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy and refusing to disown the negative parts. His sharpest exchanges with Biden came up during discussion of two of the defining battles of the Obama presidency: those around health care and immigration policy. Health care came first, with ABC News\u2019 panel of moderators beginning the debate in Houston with a heated and prolonged conversation about the merits and potential pitfalls of transitioning to a \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d single-payer health care system. Castro, who stops short of embracing a single-payer plan that forces people to drop their private insurance, nonetheless delivered a blistering attack against Biden for his health care plan. Castro simultaneously cast doubt on Biden\u2019s self-appointed status as heir to Obama\u2019s presidency, his commitment to universal health care coverage and his mental acuity. Biden argued that his proposed public health insurance option that Americans can buy into would achieve the same goals as the Medicare for All system proposed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) without forcing Americans to drop their private insurance. \u201cIf you lose the job from your ... employer, you automatically can buy into this,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cNo pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered, period.\u201d But Castro noted that by making enrollment in this public program optional rather than automatic, Biden\u2019s plan fails to guarantee universal coverage. It\u2019s a feature of Biden\u2019s plan that he disputed in the last presidential debate, but as CNN noted in a fact check, his plan only claims it will guarantee coverage for 97% of the population. In a country of 327 million people, that leaves 10 million Americans without coverage. \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered,\u201d Castro said. \u201cHe wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.\u201d Biden, who has wrapped himself in Obama\u2019s presidency more than any other candidate, interjected repeatedly to deny that characterization. \u201cThey do not have to buy in!\u201d he insisted. \u201cThey do not have to buy in \u2015\u201d Castro cut him off and went on to insinuate that Biden\u2019s memory might be failing him. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d he asked, eliciting gasps from the live audience at Texas Southern University. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying they don\u2019t have to buy in. You\u2019re forgetting that!\u201d South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who also suggested that his plan went further than Biden\u2019s, decried the pitched tone of Castro\u2019s exchange. \u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause this reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington: scoring points against each other, poking at each other and telling each other that \u2018My plan, your plan \u2015 look \u2015\u2019\u201d Castro cut him off, too. \u201cThat\u2019s called the Democratic primary election, Pete. That\u2019s called an election. That\u2019s an election. You know? This is what we\u2019re here for. It\u2019s an election,\u201d he said, eliciting cheers from the crowd. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota did her best to call for unity as well, though her line barely made it through the din. \u201cA house divided cannot stand. And that is not how we\u2019re going to win this,\u201d she said. In a follow-up interview after the debate, Castro denied that he was casting aspersions on how Biden\u2019s age is affecting his fitness for office. \u201cI wasn\u2019t taking a shot at his age,\u201d he told ABC News. There is some disagreement as to whether Castro\u2019s attack was fair, with Politifact deeming it \u201cmostly false.\u201d The lack of clarity in Biden\u2019s language appears to have contributed to a misunderstanding. Biden might have thought Castro was suggesting that his plan required that people buy in to his public health care option and thus his response: that they \u201cdo not\u00a0have to buy in.\u201d But in so doing, Biden merely confirmed Castro\u2019s point that enrollment under Biden\u2019s plan is optional rather than automatic, which is why Castro seized on it as evidence of Biden contradicting himself. In a subsequent part of the exchange, Biden appeared to understand that they were debating the merits of optional enrollment. He noted that his plan automatically enrolls Americans who are eligible for Medicaid \u2015 those with earnings below 138% of the federal poverty level \u2015 and thus would likely cover Castro\u2019s late diabetic grandmother, whom Castro had referenced in the debate. \u201cIf she qualifies for Medicaid, she would automatically be enrolled,\u201d Biden said. Later on in the evening, Castro lit into Biden for failing to clarify whether he agreed early on with Obama\u2019s policy of ramping up deportation of undocumented immigrations and neglecting to prioritize immigration reform in the first two years of his presidency when Democrats controlled Congress. It\u2019s a subject that Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey lambasted Biden for failing to address in the last debate in Detroit on July 31. The exchange began when Univision host Jorge Ramos, who co-moderated the debate, asked Biden whether he considered the administration\u2019s harder-line approach to immigration a \u201cmistake.\u201d Ramos also asked why Latinos should trust Biden, given his service in an Obama administration in which immigration reform advocates increasingly find fault. Biden first fell back on a stock answer. \u201cComparing [President Obama] to the president we have is outrageous,\u201d he said. But Ramos called him out for failing to answer the question: Does he stand by the Obama administration\u2019s record? \u201cThe president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time,\u201d Biden finally said. Ramos continued: What about Biden? \u201cI\u2019m the vice president of the United States,\u201d he said. Ramos then turned to Castro, asking him what compromises he\u2019d be willing to make to help immigrants as president. But Castro stayed on Biden, finishing the job that Ramos started with a riff on Booker\u2019s critique of Biden from the previous debate. \u201cEvery time something good about Barack Obama comes up, [Biden] says, \u2018Oh, I was there, I was there, I was there \u2015 that\u2019s me, too.\u2019 And then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, \u2018Well, that was the president,\u2019\u201d Castro declared, prompting applause from the audience. \u201cHe wants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work but not have to answer any questions. I don\u2019t get that.\u201d Biden denied saying that. \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad and indifferent. That\u2019s where I stand,\u201d he replied. Castro, the only Latino candidate in the presidential primary field, has staked his underdog bid for the presidency in no small part on his ambitious immigration reform plan. During the first Democratic presidential debate in Miami in late June, Castro had a heated exchange with former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, a fellow Texan who refused to back Castro\u2019s plan to downgrade unauthorized border crossings to a civil violation from their current status as a felony. Of course, staking one\u2019s candidacy in part on a criticism of Obama\u2019s legacy is tricky terrain for any Democratic White House hopeful. The former president retains sky-high popularity among Democratic voters. Castro was careful, though, to praise Obama for his work passing the Affordable Care Act and distinguish him from Trump when it comes to immigration policy. \u201cI agree that Barack Obama was very different from Donald Trump,\u201d Castro said. \u201cDonald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article attributed the comment about a \u201chouse divided\u201d to Sen. Kamala Harris. It was Sen. Amy Klobuchar who made the remark.",
