      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " A Democratic candidate for a California House seat invoked the name of a prominent Republican senator who famously rejected an Islamophobic attack to slap down a similar narrative being used against him by the GOP incumbent. \u201cThe first thought that came to mind ... is that Republican John McCain would be rolling in his grave today if he saw this ad,\u201d\u00a0Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar\u00a0told ABC News on Wednesday about his opponent\u2019s attempt to link him to terrorism. His reference was to a 2008 campaign moment when McCain, then the GOP presidential nominee, defended Democratic opponent Barack Obama against a voter who said he was an \u201cArab.\u201d McCain died in August. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.),\u00a0Campa-Najjar\u2019s opponent, is facing a tough battle for re-election in a conservative district near San Diego after being indicted in August on charges of using hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign funds for personal expenses. He has enlisted his father, a longtime former congressman himself, and several retired Marine Corps generals to accuse Campa-Najjar of sympathizing with terrorists. Hunter\u2019s campaign further claimed in an ad that Campa-Najjar changed his name to hide his family\u2019s connection to terrorism, and portrayed him as a Muslim radical who would \u201cinfiltrate\u201d Congress and present a threat to national security. \u201cMore than any poll ... that ad shows you that I\u2019m not a threat to national security, but I sure as heck am a threat to Duncan Hunter\u2019s seat,\u201d\u00a0Campa-Najjar added in the ABC News interview. Campa-Najjar, 29, who is of Palestinian and Latino descent, would be among the youngest members of Congress if elected in November.\u00a0He previously worked in Obama\u2019s administration as a Labor Department public affairs officer, where he carried a federal security clearance. He\u2019s also Christian. Hunter\u2019s attacks reach into Campa-Najjar\u2019s controversial family history, including the participation of his grandfather,\u00a0Yasser al-Najjar, in the deadly attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.\u00a0Campa-Najjar said he never knew his grandfather, who was killed by Israeli agents 16 years before the candidate was born. He has condemned the Munich attack and said he shouldn\u2019t be judged by his family member\u2019s actions. Hunter Sr., the GOP congressman\u2019s father, spoke to reporters in front of a retired aircraft carrier in downtown San Diego earlier this week to lay out his case against Campa-Najjar. Holding up poster boards featuring images of Campa-Najjar\u2019s family, the former congressman accused the Democrat of ongoing ties to his father, a former member of the Palestine Liberation Organization. \u201cVery simple, this has nothing to do with race, it has to do with terrorism,\u201d Hunter Sr.\u00a0told reporters. \u201cThis is terrorism.\u201d Campa-Najjar, listening quietly nearby, shook the former congressman\u2019s hand after the presentation said he is all but estranged from his father. \u201cDuncan Hunter Jr. can\u2019t stand on his own two feet like a grown man and fight his own battles,\u201d\u00a0Campa-Najjar said. \u201cHe can\u2019t stand next to me.\u201d",

Doug Ducey (R) on Tuesday named Jon Kyl to fill the late John McCain\u2019s Senate seat. \u201cThere is no one in Arizona more prepared to represent our state in the U.S. Senate than Jon Kyl,\u201d Ducey said in a statement. \u201cHe understands how the Senate functions, and will make an immediate and positive impact benefiting all Arizonans.\u201d Kyl, 76, previously served 18 years in the U.S. Senate, becoming the second-highest-ranked GOP senator before retiring in 2013. According to the Arizona Republic, he has agreed to serve at least through the end of this year. If Kyl chooses to step down at that point, Ducey will have to name another successor. Kyl said he would not run for the seat in 2020. Kyl\u00a0joined top K Street firm Covington & Burling\u00a0shortly after his retirement in 2013, and was recently\u00a0retained by Facebook\u00a0to help the social media network combat partisan bias in its news distribution. Ducey contacted Kyl in the hours after McCain\u2019s death on Aug. 25 to see if he\u2019d return to Capitol Hill. The governor said in his statement he was \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d to Kyl for agreeing to succeed his friend and former colleague McCain. \u201cEvery single day that Jon Kyl represents Arizona in the United States Senate is a day when our state is being well-served,\u201d the statement read. President Donald Trump, who was frequently critical of McCain, praised his replacement: Cindy McCain, wife of the late senator, tweeted about Kyl on Tuesday, calling him \u201ca dear friend\u201d: Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) also praised the choice. This story has been updated. Eliot Nelson contributed to this report.",

      "content": " Bridget McCain, the youngest daughter of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, spoke out publicly for the first time against President Donald Trump\u2019s recent flurry of attacks on her father. \u201cEveryone doesn\u2019t have to agree with my dad or like him, but I do ask you to be decent and respectful,\u201d she tweeted Thursday, adding that her father had died less than seven months ago. The 27-year-old, in her tweets, confirmed Trump wasn\u2019t invited to McCain\u2019s funeral in August, as was widely rumored at the time. \u201cEven if you were invited to my dad\u2019s funeral, you would have only wanted to be there for the credit and not for any condolences,\u201d she wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, you could not be counted on to be courteous, as you are a child in the most important role the world knows.\u201d Meghan McCain, a co-host on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d and one of the Arizona lawmaker\u2019s daughters, noted Thursday that it was exceedingly rare for her little sister to make a public statement. \u201cI\u2019m not the only child in my family \u2015 I have six brothers and sisters,\u201d Meghan McCain said during Thursday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe View.\u201d \u201cMy little sister Bridget, for the first time ever, has decided that she wants to speak out. She\u2019s very, very private. ... I think it\u2019s very brave of her.\u201d Trump, who often sparred with John McCain over the years, reignited his attacks on the decorated Navy war veteran in recent weeks. During a speech at a tank factory in Ohio on Wednesday, Trump lamented that no one had ever thanked him for approving McCain\u2019s state funeral arrangements. \u201cI gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI didn\u2019t get \u2018thank you.\u2019 That\u2019s OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn\u2019t a fan of John McCain. ... Not my kind of guy.\u201d Trump, over the weekend, sent a series of tweets bashing John McCain for his role in killing a GOP bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, calling out his academic record when he was a student decades ago at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He also falsely accused McCain of \u201cspreading\u201d the infamous Steele dossier, which alleged to contain Russian blackmail material on Trump, to the media ahead of the 2016 election. Cindy McCain, John McCain\u2019s widow, and her daughter Meghan have taken the lead in defending the senator\u2019s legacy against Trump\u2019s jabs. \u201cI don\u2019t expect decency and compassion from the Trump family,\u201d Meghan said on \u201cThe View\u201d Thursday. \u201cI do want to thank the American public for all the decency and compassion that they have given us.\u201d",

      "content": "The late Sen. John McCain was honored by his congressional colleagues and members of the public at the U.S. Capitol on Friday. The senator from Arizona became the 31st person to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol rotunda, according to the Architect of the Capitol website, which says the country\u2019s \u201cmost eminent citizens\u201d are given the honor. Here\u2019s a look at some of the most memorable moments from the ceremony. The skies were clear in Washington until about 10 minutes before the honor guard carried McCain\u2019s casket into the Capitol. New York Times reporter Emily Cochrane said, \u201cOne woman described it as \u2018the heavens are weeping.\u2019\u201d President Donald Trump \u2015 who was not invited to McCain\u2019s memorial \u2015 said in a statement Monday that he asked Vice President Mike Pence to give an address at the ceremony. \u201cFor 35 years, John served in these very halls under this very dome. And he fought for what he believed in,\u201d Pence said at the service. \u201cIn my years in Congress and as vice president, we didn\u2019t always agree either. And he almost always noticed. But his support for limited government, for tax reform and support for our armed forces surely left our nation more prosperous and more secure. And he will be missed. As President Trump said yesterday, we respect his service to the country.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) also spoke. \u201cHe had America\u2019s fighting spirit,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI will miss a dear friend whose smile reminded us that service is a privilege.\u201d McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) participated in a joint wreath laying. CNN reported that McCain \u201cexpressly wanted Schumer, a Democrat, so he and McConnell jointly laid the Senate wreath.\u201d McCain will also be remembered at a memorial service at Washington\u2019s National Cathedral on Saturday.\u00a0His body will be laid to rest Sunday at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during Trump\u2019s inaugural address. \u201cI sat on that stage between Bernie and John McCain, and John McCain kept reciting to me names of dictators during that speech, because he knew more than any of us what we were facing as a nation,\u201d she said. \u201cHe understood it.

McCain and Trump had a contentious relationship for years, with McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee for president, refusing to support Trump in the 2016 campaign. As a candidate and later as president, Trump has attacked McCain repeatedly, continuing even after his death in August 2018 at age 81. While McCain was alive, Trump lambasted him for things like voting to kill an Obamacare repeal bill in the Senate and being captured while serving as a pilot in Vietnam.

Col.\u00a0Tran Trong Duyet told Vietnam News that he felt \u201cvery sad\u201d upon learning of the death of the decorated war hero. McCain was held in captivity by the North Vietnamese in Hoa Lo Prison, nicknamed the \u201cHanoi Hilton\u201d by American POWs, after his plane was shot down in October 1967 during a bombing mission over Hanoi. McCain was subjected to repeated beatings and interrogations while being held captive and sustained lifelong injuries that prevented him from raising his arms above his head. \u201cI had a lot of time meeting him when he was kept in the prison,\u201d Duyet said.\u00a0\u201cAt that time I liked him personally for his toughness and strong stance. Later on, when he became a U.S. Senator, he and Senator John Kerry greatly contributed to promote Vietnam-U.S. relations so I was very fond of him.\u201d Duyet added that he\u2019d like to send condolences to the McCain family. \u201cI think it\u2019s the same feeling for all Vietnamese people as he has greatly contributed to the development of Vietnam-U.S. relations,\u201d he said.

Indeed, in 1995, when diplomatic relations between the countries were normalized after two decades of severed ties, McCain said the United States had \u201clooked back in anger at Vietnam for too long.\u201d \u201cI cannot allow whatever resentments I incurred during my time in Vietnam to hold me from doing what is so clearly my duty,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI believe it is my duty to encourage this country to build from the losses and the hopes of our tragic war in Vietnam a better peace for both the American and Vietnamese people.\u201d",

I didn\u2019t get thank you, that\u2019s OK. We sent him on the way. But I wasn\u2019t a fan of John McCain.\u201d McCain died from brain cancer at the age of 81 in his home state of Arizona after a long career in public service. In addition to his funeral at the Episcopal cathedral, which Trump was not invited to, the former prisoner of war\u00a0lay in state\u00a0in the Arizona Capitol and the United States Capitol. His family buried him in the cemetery of the U.S. Naval Academy, his alma mater in Annapolis, Maryland. Lying in state at the U.S. Capitol requires congressional authorization, but not presidential authorization. In reality, Trump only gave approval for the use of military transportation to bring McCain\u2019s body back to Washington. At the time of McCain\u2019s death, the president also signed a proclamation ordering that flags at the White House fly at half-staff to honor the late senator. Flags usually remain at half-staff until the person\u2019s interment, but Trump raised them up after just a day \u2015 and then lowered them again after public outrage. Trump\u2019s comments in Ohio came just days after his renewed Twitter attacks on the dead senator, which isn\u2019t new behavior for a president who has long criticized McCain. The president bashed the Vietnam War veteran for his role in killing a GOP bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He also falsely accused McCain of \u201cspreading\u201d to the media the Steele dossier, which reports allegations of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. McCain\u2019s daughter Meghan\u00a0hit back at Trump\u00a0over the weekend for those earlier attacks.\u00a0McCain\u2019s daughter Bridget said on Thursday that Trump \u201cis a child\u201d and that had he been at her father\u2019s funeral, he would have come only \u201cfor the credit and not for any condolences.\u201d",

McCain joined the NFL team during its game against the Washington Redskins in her first public appearance since her husband\u2019s funeral earlier this month. She was welcomed on the field by the Cardinals\u2019 captains for the opening coin toss, including wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, a longtime friend of the McCain family. The toss went in favor of the Cardinals. Fitzgerald was among those who eulogized McCain at his funeral, speaking about his \u201cmeaningful friendship\u201d with the late senator, whom the athlete said he \u201cdeeply\u201d admired. \u201cHe didn\u2019t judge individuals based on the color of their skin, their gender, their backgrounds, their political affiliations or their bank accounts,\u201d Fitzgerald said at the memorial service. \u201cHe evaluated them on the merits of their character and the countenance of their hearts. Cindy McCain thanked the team on Twitter after the event, saying that \u201csupport for our family has been overwhelming\u201d in recent weeks. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep fighting for the America John believed in everyday,\u201d she wrote. Her comments echoed an op-ed piece she authored in USA Today last week in which she championed her husband\u2019s legacy and urged others to follow in his footsteps. \u201cJohn McCain fought for others every day of his life, whether he was wearing a uniform or standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate,\u201d McCain wrote. \u201cWith his passing, America inherently understood that this is the kind of leadership we want. That this is the kind of country we want to be. And that it is now up to us \u2014 all of us \u2014 to get into the arena and fight. Each of us must do something to fight for a greater cause.\u201d CORRECTION: A previous version of this story mistakenly said the Cardinals played the Denver Broncos on Sunday. They in fact played the Washington Redskins this week and the Broncos last week.",

It was the fourth time in a week that the president has attacked McCain, who died seven months ago.

The first will be in Phoenix on Wednesday, on what would have been his 82nd birthday. Officials in a number of states and municipalities have ordered flags to be flown at half-staff, including at the U.S. Capitol and other government buildings. Flags at the White House, however, were raised to full-staff less than 48 hours after McCain\u2019s death. The National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., on Monday\u00a0placed a portrait of McCain on its \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d wall, located on the museum\u2019s first floor. Here\u2019s a calendar of other major events that will honor McCain\u2019s life. McCain\u2019s body will lie in state in the rotunda of the Arizona state Capitol. The public can pay their respects beginning at 2 p.m. local time following a private service at 10 a.m., according to McCain\u2019s office. Arizonans will hold a memorial service for McCain at North Phoenix Baptist Church. Tickets are no longer available but the event will be livestreamed on McCain\u2019s website. McCain\u2019s body will lie in state inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. His Senate colleagues and staff will honor him in a ceremony beginning at 11 a.m. Eastern time Friday. Members of the public will be able to enter through the Capitol Visitor Center and\u00a0pay their respects from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. McCain will become one of about three dozen people in U.S. history to be honored through this tradition, according to the Architect of the Capitol. Lying \u201cin state\u201d refers to government leaders and military members, and lying \u201cin honor\u201d refers to private citizens. Past dignitaries who have been memorialized in this way include former presidents Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy, as well as civil rights icon Rosa Parks. The most recent person to lie in honor was evangelical leader Billy Graham, who died in February. A televised funeral service will begin at 10 a.m. at the Washington National Cathedral. At McCain\u2019s request, former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush\u00a0are set to deliver eulogies. McCain ran presidential campaigns against both men. President Donald Trump, however, does not plan to attend. McCain reportedly did not want him there, after Trump\u2019s relentless personal attacks on McCain. McCain\u2019s family will hold a private service at his alma mater in Annapolis, Maryland, before laying him to rest at the academy\u2019s cemetery. This post has been updated with additional memorial events for McCain.",

Klobuchar, speaking to a crowd of more than 200 at Jasper\u2019s Winery, said she sat next to McCain, one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken Republican critics, and Sen.

McCain faced criticism from Democrats for not doing more to oppose the policies and appointments of a president he frequently lambasted, but Klobuchar and other Democratic senators frequently praise him as a Republican they were able to work with during increasingly partisan times.

      "content": " President Donald Trump on Sunday attacked the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Twitter for the second time this weekend, accusing him of sharing the infamous Russia dossier with the media and mocking him over his academic record at the U.S. Naval Academy. The president falsely claimed recently unsealed court documents proved McCain sent the dossier, which was written by former British spy Christopher Steele and alleged Russia has salacious material about Trump that could be used for blackmail, to the FBI and media ahead of the 2016 election. \u201cHe & the Dems, working together, failed (as usual),\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday. Court documents actually revealed David Kramer, a former State Department official and McCain associate, shared the dossier with several media outlets in December 2016 \u2015 after Trump won the presidency. No evidence has surfaced that McCain himself leaked the unconfirmed dossier to the press, which he denied doing. He confirmed in his 2018 memoir that he gave the dossier to then-FBI director James Comey in December 2016. Kramer\u2019s role in disseminating the dossier was disclosed in a recently unsealed transcript of a court deposition he gave in December 2017. Trump has repeatedly claimed the dossier was \u201cfake\u201d and \u201ctotally discredited,\u201d though many of its claims have been proven at least partially true. Trump also used his Sunday tweet to knock McCain\u2019s grades when he was a student decades ago at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, claiming he was \u201clast in his class.\u201d McCain, who died in August 2018 after a more than year-long fight with brain cancer, graduated fifth from the bottom\u00a0of his class in 1958. \u201cI was something of a discipline problem to begin with,\u201d McCain had said of his time at the academy. \u201cThe problem being, I didn\u2019t like discipline.\u201d Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, recently revealed in congressional testimony that during the 2016 presidential campaign, he made threats on behalf of his boss to schools Trump had attended to prevent them from releasing his academic record to the public. Trump on Saturday quoted Ken Starr, the former independent counsel whose investigation resulted in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, as calling the Russian dossier \u201ca very dark stain\u201d against McCain. \u201cHe had far worse \u2018stains\u2019 than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years campaigning to repeal and replace,\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to McCain\u2019s vote against the GOP bill to kill the Affordable Care Act in July 2017. Meghan McCain, co-host of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d and one of the late senator\u2019s children, tore into Trump over his tweets. \u201cNo one will ever love you the way they loved my father,\u201d she tweeted on Saturday. \u201cI wish I had been given more [Saturdays] with him. Maybe spend yours with your family instead of on twitter obsessing over mine?\u201d She posted another response on Sunday that said, \u201cMy father lives rent free in your head.\u201d She later deleted the tweet. In an apparent reaction to the TV personality\u2019s words, Trump retweeted a message on Sunday penned by one of his supporters. \u201cMillions of Americans truly LOVE President Trump, not McCain,\u201d the tweet read. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close friend of McCain\u2019s, defended his former colleague\u2019s legacy on Sunday. \u2033[McCain] stepped forward to risk his life for his country, served honorably under difficult circumstances, and was one of the most consequential senators in the history of the body,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cNothing about his service will ever be changed or diminished.\u201d Graham had been an outspoken Trump critic before becoming one of the president\u2019s most high-profile supporters in recent months, sparking confusion and anger from some of those who, like him, had been staunch McCain allies. Trump and McCain, the GOP\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee, frequently butted heads over the last few years. Trump, who avoided military service multiple times as a young man, infamously mocked the decorated Navy veteran for having been held as a prisoner of war for over five years during the Vietnam War. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), during an appearance Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d called on Trump to apologize for his tweets attacking McCain. \u201cI\u2019ve long thought that his personal and direct attacks on Sen. McCain was one of the most detestable things about President Trump\u2019s conduct as a candidate,\u201d Coons said. \u201cI frankly think that the president\u2019s continued attacks on the now late Sen. John McCain is something that is regrettable.\u201d This story has been updated to include Graham\u2019s comments and Trump\u2019s retweet.",

      "content": " President Donald Trump on Saturday expressed his condolences to the family of Sen. John McCain, who died Saturday after a battle with an aggressive form of brain cancer. The two men, while both Republicans, were political foes. McCain was a leading member of the so-called Never Trumpers, conservatives who refused to get onboard the Trump train. According to reports, the president was disinvited to McCain\u2019s funeral. Trump made his disdain for McCain clear in the summer of 2015 \u2015 shortly after announcing his presidential run \u2015 by throwing out a belittling comment about the Arizona senator\u2019s military record. He told a crowd gathered at an Iowa political forum that McCain was \u201cnot a war hero.\u201d The future president suggested that others considered McCain a hero\u00a0\u201cbecause he was captured.\u201d But Trump said, \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d Trump avoided service in the military. McCain, a Navy pilot during the Vietnam War, was shot down and held prisoner for more than five years. He was repeatedly tortured, but he declined a North Vietnamese offer to release him before others who had been captured earlier.\u00a0Despite fielding criticism from a vast array of public officials, Trump refused to apologize and reportedly has no regrets. Days before Trump\u2019s slighting remarks, McCain had said the candidate \u201cfired up the crazies\u201d at the fringes of the GOP with his incendiary comments about Mexican immigrants in McCain\u2019s home state of Arizona. Over the next few years, the two men continued to clash. On several occasions last summer, the president taunted and mocked McCain at rallies where Trump\u2019s supporters chanted in response, \u201cDrain the swamp!\u201d McCain set off that criticism when, just days after receiving his devastating medical diagnosis, he voted against a Republican health care bill to repeal and replace Obamacare with a dramatic thumbs-down gesture. Trump seemed unable to let that July 2017 vote go. Months afterward he bashed the senator on Twitter over the failed bill, claiming McCain \u201clet Arizona down!\u201d Nearly a year later, at a Tennessee political rally, the president brought it up again. Then there was the time Congress passed a bill with McCain\u2019s name on it. In August 2018, Trump signed the $717 billion defense measure, officially titled the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act, but\u00a0neglected to mention the senator at all\u00a0at the signing ceremony, instead boasting about a new military branch he wanted to create dubbed the Space Force.\u00a0(Former Secretary of State John Kerry, another Vietnam War vet, called the scene \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d) Trump did reference McCain later that day \u2015 but only to insult him. In private, the president\u2019s ridicule would reportedly\u00a0get physical, mocking McCain (and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell) with gestures and posturing. Once, during a meeting, White House aide Kelly Sadler reportedly\u00a0dismissed McCain\u2019s views\u00a0with a cruel remark: \u201cHe\u2019s dying anyway.\u201d McCain\u2019s rebuttals were generally measured, in contrast to the president\u2019s brash rhetorical style. When Trump threatened North Korea on Twitter, McCain critiqued the move by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a way you attack an issue and a challenge like this.\u201d Of Trump\u2019s performance at the NATO summit in 2018, McCain said\u00a0it was \u201cdisappointing, yet ultimately unsurprising.\u201d After Trump congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on his election victory, McCain noted, \u201cAn American president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections.\u201d McCain described Trump\u2019s July 2018 summit with Putin \u2015 where Trump once again refused to fully accept U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2015 as \u201cone of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\u201d Whether Trump will back off the McCain jabs now that the senator has died remains to be seen. Meghan McCain, the senator\u2019s talk show host daughter, indicated earlier this year that the White House has offered her family private apologies for some of the president\u2019s remarks in the past. But she added that Trump\u2019s attacks are something she\u2019s \u201cnever going to forgive.\u201d",

The speech immediately drew criticism from daughter Meghan McCain, who called it \u201cghoulish and deeply disturbed political propaganda,\u201d and wife Cindy McCain, who rebuked Malkin as someone who never knew her husband. Even conservative CNN host S.E.

Several sources, including Carla Eudy, a fundraiser and McCain family friend who helped plan the services, told People magazine on Wednesday that an invitation had \u201cnot [been] extended\u201d to the former Alaska governor. NBC News\u2019 Kelly O\u2019Donnell also reported\u00a0the snub. A \u201cPalin family source\u201d told O\u2019Donnell that \u201cout of respect to Senator McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point.\u201d \u201cThe Palin family will always cherish their friendship with the McCains and hold those memories dear,\u201d the source added. It\u2019s not clear why Palin was not invited to the services. As People noted, McCain had, in a documentary and book released in May,\u00a0expressed regret for choosing Palin as his 2008 running mate instead of Joseph Lieberman, a former senator from Connecticut. Reacting to the news, Palin told the UK\u2019s Daily Mail that it felt like a \u201cperpetual gut-punch\u201d whenever she heard of McCain\u2019s supposed second-thoughts. She said,\u00a0however, that she would not believe the comments unless she heard it firsthand from her former running mate. \u201cI attribute a lot of what we\u2019re hearing and reading regarding McCain\u2019s statements to his ghostwriter or ghostwriters,\u201d Palin said, adding:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know unless I heard it from Sen. McCain myself.\u201d After news broke of McCain\u2019s death on Saturday, Palin had nothing but praise for her late colleague: Several dignitaries, including the two men who bested McCain in his two bids for president, have been invited to attend the late senator\u2019s funeral and memorial services this week. Former President Barack Obama, who beat McCain and Palin in 2008, will be speaking at the late senator\u2019s funeral service at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. on Saturday. George W. Bush, who won the GOP presidential nomination in 2000 after a heated primary race against McCain, has also been invited to give a eulogy. Palin, however, won\u2019t be the only conspicuous absence at McCain\u2019s funeral and memorial services. President Donald Trump has also not been invited to attend.",

      "subtitle": "Former Georgia Sen. Richard Russell was a segregationist and longtime opponent of civil rights.",
      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 A bipartisan effort to rename a Senate office building to honor Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who died Saturday, is being met by opposition from some Republican senators, who expressed concern about dishonoring the legacy of the controversial man for whom the structure was named. The Russell Senate Office Building, one of three Senate office buildings near the U.S. Capitol that house member offices, was named after the late Democratic Sen. Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia in 1972. A New Deal supporter with a career that spanned four decades, he has a long list of accomplishments, among them being the chief sponsor of the National School Lunch Act, which provided free or low-cost school lunches to impoverished students. A skilled legislator and longtime friend of Lyndon Johnson, Russell served as the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and at one point ran for president. But he is now most known for being an avowed segregationist and a \u201cracist,\u201d as his 76-year-old niece admitted to The Washington Post\u2019s James Hohmann, and Russell\u2019s record on civil rights is shocking today. Hohmann writes: Russell successfully filibustered anti-lynching bills. He voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which he called \u201cshortsighted and disastrous.\u201d He blocked bills to eliminate poll taxes. He co-authored the \u201cSouthern Manifesto\u201d to slow the integration of public schools after the Supreme Court unanimously ordered it in Brown v. Board of Education. As a Dixiecrat \u2014 Southern Democratic politicians opposed to their party\u2019s support for civil rights \u2014 Russell openly argued the white race was superior and once vowed that he would oppose \u201cany measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about social equality and intermingling and amalgamation of the races in our states.\u201d He later toned down his rhetoric and pinned the reason for his opposition to civil rights legislation on the less controversial states\u2019 rights. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) on Tuesday began circulating a resolution to rename the Russell Senate Office Building for McCain, whose office is there, in honor of his legacy as a war hero and public servant. The effort has picked up support from many Republicans, including Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. But some Southerners expressed concern about taking Russell\u2019s name off the building, arguing that it deserves to be there, despite his opposition to civil rights. \u201cHe did so many other things,\u201d Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) told reporters on Tuesday, citing Russell\u2019s creation of the school lunch program. \u201cHe was a big supporter of the Great Society, the War on Poverty. Now, we all know those things failed, but he was a big champion of them.\u201d Perdue added, \u201cThis was a guy who was a giant in the Senate. This renaming thing because of one issue, it\u2019s somewhat troubling.\u201d Perdue said he supported the creation of a bipartisan select committee of senators to recommend how best to honor McCain\u2019s legacy in Washington, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) announced on Tuesday. McConnell suggested renaming the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing room after McCain, the committee\u2019s most recent chairman, or adding his portrait to the Senate Reception Room. Notably, however, McConnell did not address Schumer\u2019s proposal to rename the building. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), another influential Southerner in the Senate, said Russell was a \u201cwell respected\u201d man in the South. But Shelby said he had not made up his mind on whether to support changing the name of the Russell building. \u201cYou want to get into that, [then] you have to get into George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and most of our Founding Fathers, maybe with the exception of Hamilton. It\u2019s easy to prejudge what they should have done. We didn\u2019t live in that era,\u201d Shelby told reporters on Tuesday. When HuffPost noted that Washington and Jefferson, who both owned slaves, predated Russell by over 100 years, Shelby responded,\u00a0\u201cThey did. But so did others.\u201d He added,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not justifying anything. I\u2019m a Southerner. I\u2019m just saying Russell was a man of his time.\u201d The junior senator from Alabama, Democrat Doug Jones, meanwhile, had a different view of Russell\u2019s legacy. As a former U.S. attorney in Alabama, Jones is known for prosecuting Ku Klux Klan members for the 1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four African-American girls. \u201cHe certainly was a giant for sure,\u201d\u00a0Jones said of Russell. \u201cBut\u00a0I think if you go look at the overall body of work, it would be good to see [McCain\u2019s name on the building].\u201d",

The Democrat eulogized the late Arizona senator, his Republican opponent in the 2008 presidential election, during McCain\u2019s funeral on Saturday at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Obama,\u00a0reportedly listed in the program as McCain\u2019s friend, called him a man of passion who had the best interests of the country at heart, even when he was wrong. \u201cTo know John was to know that as  quick as his passions might flare, he was just as quick to forgive and ask for forgiveness,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHe knew more than most his own flaws, his blind spots. And he knew how to laugh at himself, and that self-awareness made him all the more compelling.\u201d Obama mentioned the recently resurfaced video from the 2008 campaign in which his then-rival defended him after a woman said she could not trust Obama because he is an \u201cArab.\u201d \u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d McCain responded. \u201cHe\u2019s a decent family man, a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that\u2019s what this campaign is all about.\u201d Obama said McCain\u2019s actions in that moment didn\u2019t surprise him. \u201cAs Joe Lieberman said, it was John\u2019s instinct,\u201d Obama said, referring to McCain\u2019s friend and former colleague in the Senate, who also delivered a eulogy. \u201cI never saw John treat anyone different because of their race or religion or gender, and I\u2019m certain that in those moments referred to during the campaign, he saw himself as defending America\u2019s character, not just mine.\u201d Obama said that in a time of political upheaval, it\u2019s important to rise above the easy route of anger. \u201cSo much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere\u2019s a politics that pretends to be brave and tough, but in fact is born of fear. John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that. ... What better way to honor John McCain\u2019s life of service than, as best we can follow his example, to prove that the willingness to get in the arena and fight for this country is not reserved to the few, it is open to all of us. In fact, it is demanded of all of us as citizens of this great republic.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s perhaps how we honor him best, by recognizing there are some things bigger than party or ambition or money or fame or power,\u201d Obama continued. \u201cThere are some things worth risking everything for. Principles that are eternal. Truths that are abiding. At his best, John showed us what that means. For that, we are deeply in his debt.\u201d",

If you do not feel comfortable around a climate that will be created by Ben Shapiro\u2019s presence, we encourage you to seek a safe environment for yourself,\u201d read the message from the program, which provides merit-based scholarships for students engaged in diversity-focused activities. \u201cKnowing the hostile environment that can result from these kinds of events, we encourage you to seek an inclusive environment and reach out to talk with someone. If you do not have a safe space or prefer not to be alone, please feel free to join other Morrill Scholars and our staff on the MSP learning community on the third floor of Blackburn House tonight from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Thank you and stay safe,\u201d it continued. A reporter for The Federalist and member of YAF\u2019s board of directors,\u00a0Emily Jashinsky, called the protesters shouting at Shapiro \u201cshameful.\u201d Shapiro reportedly told the crowd during his speech that protesters were shouting \u201cfuck Ben Shapiro.\u201d \u201cTo which I say, \u2019No thanks, but I\u2019m married,\u2019\u201d said Shapiro, according to The Daily Wire. Shapiro also tweeted after the event, saying, \u201cBut I\u2019m the threat to civility, guys.\u201d The late GOP Sen. John McCain\u2019s daughter, Meghan McCain, quote-tweeted a video of the protesters on Tuesday with the caption that she hopes \u201call my followers join me in rooting for Michigan\u2026#OSUsnowflakes.\u201d Last year, hundreds of protesters appeared when Shapiro spoke at the University of California, Berkeley. At that event, nine people were arrested, four of which were carrying banned weapons. Aside from that, the Los Angeles Times reported, there were \u201cseveral shouting matches\u201d but all \u201cended peacefully.\u201d",

      "content": "The White House coordinated with U.S. Navy officials to move the USS John S. McCain \u201cout of sight\u201d during President Donald Trump\u2019s recent visit to Japan, The Wall Street Journal\u00a0and The New York Times reported Wednesday. The Journal, which first reported the story, obtained a copy of an email from an official with the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. In the note, the unnamed official said he had coordinated with the White House before Trump\u2019s visit and asked other officials working with the Navy and Air Force to comply with instructions for the president\u2019s trip. \u201cUSS John McCain needs to be out of sight,\u201d the email read, listing the request as the third provision in the note. \u201cPlease confirm #3 will be satisfied.\u201d The Navy gave all sailors aboard the ship the day off on Tuesday as Trump visited Yokosuka Naval Base, the Journal and the Times reported. The ship is named in honor of three generations of McCains, who all share the name and served in the Navy. McCain sailors were not invited to see Trump speak that day, unlike sailors from other American warships at the base, the Times reported, citing several unnamed Navy service members. The White House and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment. Amid the reports, Trump wrote a message on Twitter saying he was \u201cnot informed\u201d of the request but \u201cloved being with our great Military Men and Women\u201d during his visit. White House aides confirmed to the Times that the request was made, but insisted the president did not know about it. Trump told reporters Thursday that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know a thing about\u201d McCain sailors being turned away from seeing him speak. \u201cI would never have done that,\u201d the president said. He added, however, that the request to bar them was \u201cwell-meaning.\u201d The Washington Post reported Thursday that the White House asked Navy officials to keep the McCain out of pictures during Trump\u2019s visit, citing unnamed Pentagon and White House officials. McCain died last August, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from constantly lobbing attacks at the career politician. The president\u00a0regularly lambastes McCain over his \u201cno\u201d vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act. McCain\u2019s daughter Meghan McCain commented on the Journal\u2019s report later on Wednesday, saying the president\u2019s antipathy toward her father made her \u201cgrief unbearable.\u201d \u201cTrump is a child who will always be deeply threatened by the greatness of my dads incredible life,\u201d McCain tweeted. \u201cThere is a lot of criticism of how much I speak about my dad, but nine months since he passed, Trump won\u2019t let him RIP. So I have to stand up for him.\u201d The USS John McCain is being repaired in Japan after a collision in 2017, and the Journal notes that moving the warship would have been difficult. The outlet reviewed photos from just before Trump\u2019s visit and found that tarps hung over the ship\u2019s name at times and that a barge was later moved to obscure it so it wouldn\u2019t be instantly recognizable. The Navy\u2019s chief of information contradicted those claims, however, saying the ship\u2019s name was never obscured and that the military was proud of its \u201cnamesake and heritage.\u201d\u00a0A spokesman for acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan also said the secretary was not aware of the effort, \u201cnor was he aware of the concern precipitating the directive.\u201d Trump visited Japan this week on an official state visit\u00a0and was met with great fanfare by the country\u2019s government. He also became the first foreign leader to meet with Japanese Emperor Naruhito, who was enthroned earlier this month. This article has been updated with a response from the Navy and to indicate that the ship is also named after the senator\u2019s father and grandfather.",

Despite his personal experience with that deeply undemocratic era, the House\u2019s third-ranking member apparently still views President Donald Trump as the greater threat to American democracy.\u00a0In an interview with NBC Tuesday, Rep. Clyburn described Trump and his family as \u201cthe greatest threats to democracy of my lifetime\u201d and\u00a0revived earlier comparisons he\u2019s made to Hitler. \u201cAdolf Hitler was elected chancellor of Germany.

      "author": "Doha Madani",
      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden honored the memory of Sen. John McCain at a memorial service at the North Phoenix Baptist Church in Arizona on Thursday. Biden gave an emotional eulogy for McCain, who died at the age of 81 on Saturday after a battle with brain cancer. They had a decadeslong friendship that began in the early days of their time in Washington. The former vice president\u2019s speech was a powerful reflection on McCain\u2019s life and legacy as the nation mourns his loss. \u201cTo paraphrase Shakespeare, we shall not see his like again,\u201d Biden said. Here are some of the most heartbreaking moments of Biden\u2019s eulogy.  McCain and Biden were both young men who experienced hardship and loss early in their lives. McCain endured torture as a prisoner of war in Vietnam while he was serving the Navy. Biden lost his first wife and their young daughter in a car crash in 1972, just a month after winning his first Senate race in Delaware. Both men met shortly after their personal tragedies, when McCain served as a Navy liaison for the Senate, but they never touched on their pasts, Biden said. \u201cAnd we would sit on that plane, late into the night while everyone else was asleep, and just talk, getting to know one another,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe\u2019d talk about family. We\u2019d talk about politics. We\u2019d talk about international relations. We\u2019d talk about promise.\u201d \u201cWe talked about everything but captivity and the loss of my family, which had just occurred, my wife and daughter,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe only two things we didn\u2019t talk about.\u201d  Biden recounted the years early in his career that he spent getting to know McCain, telling the crowd they \u201cjust hit it off.\u201d The former vice president told stories of the friendship McCain had with Biden\u2019s sons and second wife, Jill Biden. \u201cAs a young man, he\u2019d come up to my house, he\u2019d come to Wilmington, and out of this grew a great friendship that transcended whatever political differences we had or later developed. Because above all, we understood the same thing. That all politics is personal. It\u2019s all about trust. And I trusted John with my life,\u201d Biden said. Beau Biden, one of Joe Biden\u2019s children, died in 2015 from glioblastoma, the same rare brain cancer that McCain was diagnosed with last year. The former vice president spoke candidly about something universal: how much cancer sucks. \u201cWe both knew then from our different experiences ... that there are times when life can be so cruel \u2014 pain so blinding, it\u2019s hard to see anything else,\u201d Joe Biden said. \u201cThe disease that took John\u2019s life, took our mutual friend Teddy [Kennedy]\u2019s life nine years ago, and three years ago, it took my beautiful son Beau\u2019s life.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s brutal, it\u2019s relentless, it\u2019s unforgiving. And it takes so much from those we love and the families who love them that in order to survive, we have to remember how they lived, not how they died,\u201d Biden continued.  In his speech, Biden captured the feeling of grief, describing the absence of McCain as \u201call consuming.\u201d Biden addressed the McCain family directly on what they may be feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s like being sucked into a black hole inside your chest, and it\u2019s frightening,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd I know something else, unfortunately, from experience: that there\u2019s nothing anyone can say or do to ease the pain right now. But I pray you take some comfort knowing that because you shared John with all of us your whole life, the world now shares with you the ache of John\u2019s death.\u201d  Biden managed to bring some levity to his emotional speech, telling stories of times the two senators would talk to each other in a brutally honest fashion. \u2033Whenever I was in trouble, John was the first guy there, and I hope I was there for him. And we never hesitated to give each other advice,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe\u2019d call me in the middle of a campaign and say, \u2018What the hell did you say that for? You just screwed up, Joe.\u2019\u201d They always had each other\u2019s backs, Biden said. There has been an outpouring of kind words about McCain in recent days from Democrats and Republicans alike. Biden said on Thursday that the senator\u2019s death has been felt so resoundingly because of how McCain\u2019s love of his country gave Americans \u201cconfidence.\u201d \u201cJohn believed so deeply and passionately in the soul of America. His faith in the core values of this nation made them somehow feel it more genuinely themselves,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHis conviction that we as a country would never walk away from the sacrifices generations of Americans have made to defend liberty and dignity around the world it made Americans proud of themselves. His belief \u2014 and it was deep \u2014 that Americans can do anything, withstand anything, achieve anything was both unflagging and ultimately reassuring.\u201d  Biden ended his speech by addressing McCain\u2019s family. He told McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy McCain, that the late senator \u201cowed so much of what he was to you.\u201d And then Biden spoke directly to McCain\u2019s children. \u201cYou may not have had your father as long as you would have liked, but you got from him everything you need,\u201d Biden said. \u201cTo pursue your own dreams. To follow the course of your own spirit. You are a living legacy \u2014\u00a0not hyperbole. You are a living legacy, living proof of John McCain\u2019s success.\u201d  Watch Biden\u2019s full eulogy below.",

He was 81. \u201cYou used to get up early in the morning and go get us all Starbucks in town in the Cottonwood Safeway and then come home and make eggs and bacon,\u201d McCain began her post. \u201cYou always had a giant venti cappuccino.

Continuing in several additional tweets, McCain told her followers to never allow magazines to \u201cshame you to be honest & open,\u201d adding, \u201cnever be embarrassed to talk or share grief, pain, real life, struggle.\u201d McCain also noted that the anniversary of her father\u2019s death is only days away, and that she \u201cmade a conscious choice to share my grief journey publicly so others would feel less alone - and would do it all over again.\u201d \u201cI realize a this is a small thing in the scheme of things but I just don\u2019t know why women\u2019s magazines don\u2019t do a better job trying to lift other women up, especially in 2019 (even if you disagree with their politics),\u201d she said. The Elle article was based on a wide-ranging interview New Yorker staff writer Carrie Battan conducted with McCain in May. The start of the piece isn\u2019t exactly flattering \u2015\u00a0taking stock of the \u201cfresh wave of drama\u201d that \u201ctries to knock McCain over\u201d each week, including the occasional \u201cuproar over something she\u2019s said in a heated segment about immigration or abortion.\u201d \u201cWhen there\u2019s nothing serious to latch onto, there might simply be a surge of blind frustration aimed at the good old-fashioned nepotism that helped boost McCain to her current perch, or a chorus of cackles about something she\u2019s chosen to wear,\u201d Battan writes. McCain has indeed gone viral on social media several times in recent months, if not for her bickering with her talk show co-stars, then for her criticism of Rep. Ilhan Omar\u2019s (D-Minn.) remarks on Israel. The conservative TV personality has also faced personal tragedy. She opened up about her miscarriage in a heart-wrenching New York Times op-ed last month, and Aug. 25 will mark one year since her father\u2019s death. However, neither topic was the focus of Battan\u2019s profile. CNN\u2019s S.E. Cupp and Fox News\u2019 Julie Banderas both expressed support for McCain on Twitter, receiving retweets and an \u201cI love you\u201d in response. Elle did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.",

      "content": " Sen. John McCain died Saturday at the age of 81 after discontinuing cancer treatment. The former Republican presidential nominee was often spoken of as a military hero, a political maverick and as someone with a bit of a temper. But he was far from a humorless politician. McCain had a great sense of humor, in fact.\u00a0Like many politicians running for president, he appeared on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d The difference with McCain, though, was that he really seemed to relish the experience, making plenty of jokes at his own expense. In one clip, seen below, McCain appears on the show\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update\u201d to explain to host Seth Meyers his many outlandish ideas for shoring up votes in the 2008 presidential election. They include strategies like \u201cThe Reverse Maverick,\u201d \u201cThe Double Maverick\u201d and, our favorite, \u201cThe Sad Grandpa,\u201d in which McCain is to appear on television and sadly proclaim, \u201cCome on, Obama\u2019s going to have plenty of chances to run for president \u2015 it\u2019s my turn!\u201d The Arizona senator could also dish it out, but in ways that weren\u2019t mean-spirited. During the 2008 Alfred E. Smith dinner \u2015 a tradition where both presidential candidates tell jokes and roast each other \u2015 McCain dryly (and brilliantly) overhyped then-Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s upcoming turn at the podium after claiming to have seen the transcript of his routine. \u201cYou are all about to witness the funniest performance in the 63-year history of this event,\u201d McCain said. \u201cLet\u2019s not add to the mounting pressure he must be feeling. Just prepare yourself for nonstop hilarity. The funniest 15 minutes of your life or any other.\u201d How do you follow that? On \u201cSNL,\u201d he usually played himself, but in this sketch parodying a Lifetime movie, McCain plays a creepy husband who wants nothing more than to be close to his darling wife, played by Amy Poehler. It\u2019s a long bit but worth watching. McCain leaves behind a celebrated legacy. He was a decorated veteran and a lifelong public servant. And, as his onetime legislative partner, the\u00a0former Sen. Russ Feingold, points out, \u201che was also really fun.\u201d It certainly looks like it.",
