      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Look up \u201ccorrupt\u201d in the dictionary and you could expect to find an illustration of Donald Trump looking right back \u2015 yet that has not kept the president from repeatedly calling others corrupt in recent weeks. Trump has given his daughter and son-in-law prominent White House jobs, steers lobbyists and political groups seeking his favor toward using his Pennsylvania Avenue hotel, and even successfully pushed the U.S. government to host the next G-7 meeting\u00a0at his own golf resort, which will put tens of millions of American tax dollars into his own cash registers next June. \u201cHe has no shame,\u201d said Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman who is running against Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. \u201cHe\u2019s incapable of shame. That\u2019s not normal.\u201d Indeed, such actions, had they been taken by a mayor, a county executive or a governor, would in all likelihood result in state or federal public corruption charges. While laws and rules vary by state and locality, ethics laws generally prohibit public officials from profiting from their offices. Giving oneself a large government contract \u2015 as Trump\u2019s White House announced Thursday with the selection of his troubled Doral, Florida, golf course as the site of the next summit of the world\u2019s largest democratic economies \u2015 would almost certainly result in a criminal prosecution, ethics experts said. \u201cThis is a president who believes the powers of the presidency are bestowed on him to advance his own personal interests, political and profit-seeking, rather than those of the American people,\u201d said Robert Weissman, president of the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen. But as the sitting president, Trump is immune from both ethics laws and criminal prosecution, and not only has he openly engaged in nepotism and self-dealing, he has, in recent weeks, started accusing political opponents and the news media of \u201ccorruption.\u201d At an Oct. 2 news conference, for example, he called former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter \u201cstone, cold corrupt.\u201d At an Oct. 11 rally in Lake Charles, Louisiana, he broadened that to all Democrats: \u201cThe radical Democrats\u2019 policies are crazy. Their politicians are corrupt.\u201d In an Oct. 14 statement he posted on Twitter, Trump called The New York Times corrupt. Just two days later, during a photo opportunity with the visiting president of Italy, he called his predecessor Barack Obama corrupt, as well as the entire 2016 election. Others Trump has labeled \u201ccorrupt\u201d in recent weeks: former FBI director James Comey, former FBI agent Peter Strzok, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, the entire Mueller investigation into the help Russia gave Trump in winning the 2016 election, all of the news media, California Democratic congressman Adam Schiff and CNN. To Trump critics, the president\u2019s attacks are part of a predictable pattern: Accuse others of the inappropriate behavior that he himself engages in. Bandy Lee, among a group of mental health professionals who have been warning of Trump\u2019s state of mind for years, said Trump is exhibiting typical behavior for a \u201cparanoid, delusional\u201d leader. \u201cHe accuses others exactly of what he is responsible for,\u201d said Lee, a Yale Medical School professor of psychiatry. \u201cIt is a psychological defense called \u2018projection.\u2019\u201d Josh Schwerin, a former spokesman for 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, recalled Trump\u2019s response when Clinton accused Trump of behaving like Russian dictator Vladimir Putin\u2019s puppet. \u201cNo puppet. No puppet. You\u2019re the puppet,\u201d Trump replied at the third and final presidential debate. \u201cHe accuses other people of doing the bad things he\u2019s doing,\u201d Schwerin said. \u201cHe is the most corrupt president in modern times,\u201d said Jennifer Horn, a former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party. \u201cHe has to convince his followers that everyone is corrupt so they will ignore his corruption.\u201d The White House did not respond to HuffPost queries regarding Trump\u2019s self-dealing and nepotism. One top Republican National Committee member, though, said he is not bothered by any of Trump\u2019s behavior, and instead attacked the news media for not reporting sufficiently on the Clinton Foundation, Hunter Biden or the money former Obama has made since leaving office. \u201cA few dollars on his hotels, which are actually a legitimate business, I\u2019m not going to lose much sleep over,\u201d said Shawn Steel, a longtime RNC member from California, urging more scrutiny of Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Damaging Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 candidacy was a key objective of Trump\u2019s newfound interest in rooting out \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine, according to a top Trump adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. Trump believes Biden would be his strongest opponent and has sought to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate a conspiracy theory that Ukrainian officials seeking to help Hillary Clinton win the 2016 election planted false evidence to make it appear that Russia had helped Trump. According to that conspiracy theory, which also manages to tie in the Bidens and Hungarian billionaire George Soros and the framing of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the hacked Democratic National Committee server and Clinton\u2019s 33,000 deleted emails have been hidden away somewhere in Ukraine. Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, has called the claim \u201ccompletely debunked\u201d and warned that Trump\u2019s obsession with it would be the \u201cwhite whale\u201d that could bring him down. Indeed, it was Trump\u2019s request of Ukraine\u2019s president in a July 25 phone call to investigate both the Bidens and the 2016 election conspiracy that sparked a whistleblower complaint against Trump, which in turn led to the ongoing impeachment inquiry. White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted Thursday that those considerations played into Trump\u2019s policy toward Ukraine. \u201cGet over it: There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d he said. Kendal Unruh, a former GOP activist from Colorado who led the unsuccessful effort to dump Trump at the 2016 party convention, said it was distressing to see Republicans tolerating the president\u2019s actions. \u201cThe Republican Party has become completely corrupted to the core in their habitual defense of Trump\u2019s behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to watch the death of a party that once actually stood for morality and the rule of law.\u201d Yet Yale psychiatrist Lee said increasing pressure on Trump with the threat of impeachment will create a far greater danger to the country than the mere diminishment of a political party. \u201cHis emotional drive to project all his own corruption and ineptitude onto others will overwhelm any ability on the part of others to correct or redirect his lies,\u201d she said. \u201cThis drive will become more severe with greater pressure and, paradoxically, the sicker he is, the more effective his pathology will be in overcoming any resistance, starting with himself.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Campaigning on policy doesn\u2019t work for every Democrat. Here\u2019s why it seems to be working for her.",
      "author": "Jonathan Cohn",
      "content": " DETROIT \u2015 Elizabeth Warren took her presidential campaign to the Midwest this week, starting with two stops in Michigan where she unveiled a $2 trillion \u201cgreen manufacturing\u201d proposal. The choice of locale had little to do with state\u2019s Democratic primary, which comes well into the cycle on March 10, and everything to do with symbolism. Michigan is among the politically critical states Donald Trump won narrowly in 2016. This was Warren\u2019s way of saying that she can win there by seizing one of his signature issues: bringing factory jobs back to the U.S. The Massachusetts senator has been doing a lot of that lately. She rolled out her opioid plan in West Virginia and Ohio, two states ravaged by the epidemic, and introduced a plan to protect public lands during a swing through Colorado and Utah. When it was time to sketch out a scheme to increase affordable housing, Warren toured low-income neighborhoods in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee. These trips have organizing value, especially because of Warren\u2019s now-famous \u201cselfie lines,\u201d where she offers a photo to anybody willing to wait. (Just think of all the images bouncing around on social media pages.)\u00a0But it\u2019s the attention these trips generate for her policies, not the pictures, that best explains why Warren has been gaining ground. It wasn\u2019t so long ago that the professional political class was ready to dismiss her. She couldn\u2019t shake the controversy over her statements about Native American heritage and, despite being well-known and beloved on the activist left, her poll numbers dipped \u2015 relegating her to the middle of the second tier, with a bunch of other candidates looking up at Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden. Now she has been on the cover of Time magazine\u00a0and her\u00a0poll numbers\u00a0are on the rise. Although she remains well behind the front-runners, a recent Economist/YouGov survey found 42% of Democratic voters were at least considering Warren for the primaries. It was the second highest of any Democrat, just behind Biden and just ahead of Sanders. (Over the weekend, a new Iowa poll\u00a0produced strikingly similar results.) At this early stage of the primary campaign, with so many voters still tuning in for the first time, that means a lot. But it is one thing to climb back into the Democratic race and quite another to win it, to say nothing of prevailing in November. And there are reasons to wonder just how far policy can take Warren, starting with what happened to the last brainy presidential candidate who ran on an ambitious, detailed campaign agenda.\u00a0Warren\u2019s mantra is \u201cI have a plan for that,\u201d but Hillary Clinton had plenty of plans too. In 2016, she still came up short in the Electoral College. Warren, though, is not Hillary. In fact, her approach to policy is more reminiscent of the other Clinton, Bill, back when he first ran for president in 1992. In the run-up to that election, Bill more or less invented the modern version of campaigning on policy, eventually publishing a book, \u201cPutting People First,\u201d that turned into a governing blueprint for his first years in office. As president, he became famous for policy-laden State of the Union speeches that consistently bored pundits and impressed the public, buoying him in moments of political peril. The idea that Warren has more in common with Bill than Hillary might seem odd, given that Warren\u2019s unabashedly liberal agenda is an explicit rejection\u00a0of the Democrats\u2019 governing philosophy in the 1990s \u2015 one that was openly apologetic about big government, relied heavily on free trade and free markets, and led to the regulatory changes in banking that first attracted Warren\u2019s ire and pushed her into politics. But on bread-and-butter issues, Bill in 1992 ran a thematically populist campaign that worked because of how it fit together, who he was, and the kind of leadership he was proposing to unseat. In other words, he had a coherent, credible story to tell. Warren does too. That story starts with Warren\u2019s upbringing in Oklahoma, in a family that sometimes faced financial difficulty, especially after her father, who had juggled a series of blue-collar jobs, had to stop working because of a heart attack. It is not a story of overcoming extraordinary struggle. It is a story of overcoming ordinary struggle, like losing the family station wagon, punctuated by occasional crises and bad decisions, like the time Warren left college early in order to marry a man she would later divorce. The bemused, sardonic way she reminisces about that episode \u2015 \u201cyou know it\u2019s a problem when you have to refer to the husbands by their number\u201d \u2015 probably rings true to the tens of millions of Americans who have gone through divorce, or at the very least a large portion of the women among them. These recollections, so well known to reporters and followers but still new to most Americans, do more than establish a connection with potential voters. They give Warren a natural platform for talking about policy, because she can attest personally to the importance of things like a high minimum wage (which is what her mom got when she was supporting the family), strong unions (which is how her brother got his pension), and cheap community colleges (which is how she eventually got her degree). Maybe the best known of these is the story she tells about her experience as a working mother, sobbing because she couldn\u2019t find decent child care and was preparing to quit her job, until her Aunt Bee saved her by moving in and taking care of the kids. \u201cIf everybody in the world had an Aunt Bee, we\u2019d all be fine,\u201d Warren said during an MSNBC town hall in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the day after her Michigan tour. \u201cBut they don\u2019t.\u201d Then Warren pivoted to her child care plan, which she says will guarantee affordable, quality care for all families with kids. One risk of proposing so many policies is that they come to seem scattershot, so that the whole ends up being a lot less than the sum of the parts. Warren has managed to avoid this so far, in part because she\u2019s got such a clear, strong overarching message to her campaign \u2015 that she is fighting to make sure government is on the side of low- and middle-income Americans, not the wealthy and powerful corporations out to exploit them. It\u2019s a familiar trope that works best with a foil. Bill Clinton in 1992 had the advantage of running against a patrician, seemingly aloof George H.W. Bush in the middle of a recession. Hillary had a much tougher time because she was running against Trump, who promised, as she did, to protect working-class Americans. Trump had a very specific kind of working-class American in mind, namely the white kind, but he made enough promises \u2015 like great health care for everyone \u2015 to undermine Hillary\u2019s claim to the populist mantle. Warren has the luxury of running against a different version of Trump, one that still talks like a populist but has the governing record of a plutocrat. He gave huge tax cuts to the rich. He made it easier for corporations to take jobs offshore. He tried to take\u00a0health insurance away from tens of millions of people. He\u2019s knee-deep in corruption. Of course every Democrat can (and does) make these attacks. Warren has the credibility of somebody whose political career started as a crusader against greedy, corrupt banks. And then there are the plans. It\u2019s obvious from the details of her proposals that she\u2019s consulted widely with experts and has thought through some of the tougher design questions, like how you actually make sure there are enough new child care providers and that they will be good at what they do. Much of this necessarily goes beyond what even most politically engaged voters grasp. That may not matter. At the Detroit rally, a working mother named Hallie Bard, from the suburb of Farmington, talked about how much Warren\u2019s child care plan meant to her, even though she didn\u2019t know much about how the plan would actually work. \u201cI have been dealing with this for 15 years,\u201d Bard said. \u201cIt has prohibited me from taking jobs occasionally, because my entire check would go to child care and I am not about to underpay someone to care for the most important people in my life. \u2026 It\u2019s important to me that she gets it, that she understands there needs to be a dedication to that.\u201d But as the campaign moves forward, not everyone will take to Warren or her agenda so kindly. There will be philosophical objections from conservatives wary of what would likely be the largest expansion of government in half a century. There will also be more practical objections, some outlandish and some not. Her wealth tax would apply to only the very richest Americans, even though Republicans are sure to imply otherwise when they attack it as a big tax hike. But it could genuinely be difficult to enforce \u2015 and, without the big sums she envisions it collecting, financing all of those great-sounding initiatives on education and health care gets more complicated. This is just one big danger of proposing so many policies: It creates so many targets for opponents to attack. Another is feasibility. She\u2019s one of the few Democrats who has called for ending the filibuster, which would stop a progressive agenda cold even if Democrats take the Senate. But she is also calling for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to vote and overturning Citizen United \u2015 steps that, however advisable, aren\u2019t happening anytime soon. And that\u2019s to say nothing of the formidable political hurdles Warren still faces, starting but not ending with the fact that a large number of Americans still have issues with women who have brains or ambition or, heaven forbid, both. That was trouble for Hillary Clinton and will just as surely be trouble for Warren too. It\u2019s a good sign for\u00a0Warren that she\u2019s drawing healthy crowds: 500 in Detroit and 1,700 in Lansing, her campaign said. But both were overwhelmingly white, even though Detroit\u00a0is the blackest city in America.\u00a0It\u2019s just one reminder that she draws support heavily from college-educated, white liberal voters \u2015 an important constituency in the Democratic Party, for sure, but hardly enough to secure the nomination. Warren has time, however, and under the right circumstances policy really can be a strong political asset. Years ago, in the middle of yet another Democratic presidential campaign, Mark Schmitt of the New America Foundation observed, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you say about the issues, it\u2019s what the issues say about you.\u201d\u00a0Right now, the issues say Warren knows who she is and what she wants to do. A pitch like that could take her far.",

      "content": " Until he abruptly reversed course Thursday, 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden was seeking to become the first Democratic presidential nominee since President Jimmy Carter to support the law banning the use of federal funds on abortion services. Though nominees through the decades had varied stances on choice \u2015 from John Kerry\u2019s \u201cpersonally pro-life\u201d dance to Hillary Clinton\u2019s full-throated support for reproductive freedom \u2015 they each came out in support of repealing the Hyde Amendment\u2019s ban on federal funding for abortion services even if, like Biden, they had to flip-flop. Carter was the first Democratic Party presidential candidate to take a position on the federal funding of abortion services. The Hyde Amendment was enacted by Congress during the 1976 presidential campaign and would be up for renewal in 1977. This was also the first presidential campaign since the Supreme Court legalized abortion in its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. A devout evangelical Christian, Carter took what would become a common abortion position for Democratic presidential nominees. He was personally opposed to abortion but would respect the court\u2019s constitutional interpretation legalizing the practice. But Carter went a bit further. He also supported the Hyde Amendment\u2019s ban on Medicaid funding being used for abortion services. \u201cI personally don\u2019t believe the federal government ought to finance abortions,\u201d Carter said at an October 1976 presidential debate. He continued to stake out this position while in office, particularly after a series of Supreme Court decisions said that the federal government had no obligation to fund abortion services. But he did endorse exceptions to the federal ban for rape, incest and the life of the mother. At the same time, he made callous statements about the federal funding ban that outraged women\u2019s rights advocates both inside and outside his administration. When asked about how the Hyde Amendment made it harder for poor women to access abortion services that rich women could easily afford, Carter gave a characteristic response: \u201cWell, as you know, there are many things in life that are not fair, that wealthy people can afford and poor people can\u2019t. But I don\u2019t believe that the federal government should take action to try to make those opportunities exactly equal, particularly when there is a moral factor.\u201d The National Organization for Women refused to endorse his reelection, even against Ronald Reagan, the first full-throated anti-abortion major party presidential nominee. Reagan\u2019s reelection opponent Walter Mondale, Carter\u2019s vice president, was a big supporter of abortion rights who endorsed dumping the Hyde Amendment. But the Republican Party spent more energy attacking his vice presidential pick Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman on a major party presidential ticket, as she was an outspoken pro-choice Catholic. A big part of the party\u2019s strategy since Nixon involved peeling off urban and suburban white Catholic voters from their traditional Democratic Party allegiance and highlighting the apparent contradiction between the Church and Ferraro was a way to play to these voters. (It also helped underline opposition to abortion rights as an extension of anti-feminism.) Democrats\u2019 1988 nominee Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was also a pro-choice opponent of the Hyde Amendment, although he couched his support for abortion rights within his personal religious opposition to abortion. Dukakis prevailed over a number of opponents in the Democratic Party primary who did support the Hyde Amendment. At the party\u2019s nominating convention a section was added to its platform that, for the first time, however euphemistically, called for repealing the Hyde Amendment, \u201cthe fundamental right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed regardless of ability to pay.\u201d Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton won the party\u2019s nomination in 1992. Like Carter, Clinton was a Southern governor who backed middle-ground social positions that conformed to his increasingly conservative state, including on abortion. As governor, he had opposed spending federal funds on abortions except in the cases of rape, incest or the life of the mother and signed legislation requiring minors to obtain parental consent to get an abortion. Those positions quickly softened in the Democratic Party primary. As the party\u2019s nominee, Clinton openly called for getting rid of the Hyde Amendment and argued that the national health care plan he was running on would provide funding for abortion services. Reproductive rights advocates welcomed Clinton\u2019s shift. \u201cIt\u2019s natural to back these kinds of pragmatic, get-along compromises in a conservative state,\u201d Harriett Woods, then-president of the National Women\u2019s Political Caucus, told the Associated Press in 1992. \u201cNow he is a national candidate responsible for a broader majority. I\u2019m pleased that he\u2019s growing.\u201d In office, Clinton proposed ending the Hyde Amendment by excluding it from the budgets he submitted to Congress. The legislature, however, did not rescind the rule, but instead loosened it to allow exceptions for rape and incest. (The Hyde Amendment already provided an exception for the life of the mother.) Clinton\u2019s health care plan would have paid for abortion coverage, but it too ran aground in Congress. Al Gore, Clinton\u2019s vice president, had a harder time squaring his reversal on the Hyde Amendment when he ran for president in 2000. In his first run for Congress, Gore sought to differentiate himself from his father, a famous liberal Southern senator, by taking more conservative positions. \u201cI don\u2019t believe a woman\u2019s freedom to live her own life, in all cases, outweighs the fetus\u2019s right to life,\u201d he said on the primary campaign trail in 1976 bid for Tennessee\u2019s 6th congressional district. By the time Gore made it to the Senate in 1985 he had adopted more pro-choice positions, including claiming he had always backed Roe v. Wade. But he continued to oppose federal funding for abortions. That was until Clinton chose him to be his vice president. Gore faced questions about his support for the Hyde Amendment immediately. He said that he still opposed federal funding for abortions, but he supported the use of federal money for abortion services in Clinton\u2019s proposed national health care plan. In the 2000 presidential campaign, Gore called for ending the Hyde Amendment. Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore\u2019s lone primary opponent, attacked him for flip-flopping on this issue. Bradley argued that Gore\u2019s past positions on abortion made him an anachronistic choice for a more modern and liberal Democratic Party and his flip-flopping made him untrustworthy. Gore said that he had \u201calways, always, always\u201d supported Roe v. Wade, but had changed his mind on his support for the Hyde Amendment after it was shown to him that the policy produced \u201can inequitable result.\u201d (This is practically identical to what has happened with Biden.) Abortion rights advocates came to Gore\u2019s defense. \u201cThe fact that he evolved doesn\u2019t make him any less pro-choice than a Bradley or anyone else,\u201d Kate Michelman, then-president of NARAL, said in 2000. This evolution, or flip-flop, however you want to cut it, fed into the media-driven narrative that Gore was inauthentic while his opponent, George W. Bush, the Yale legacy child of a wealthy century-old political dynasty, was someone you could have a beer with (even though Bush was a recovering alcoholic). Kerry\u2019s 2004 challenge to Bush featured attacks on him as both an inauthentic flip-flopper like Gore and, as with Ferraro, being a pro-choice Catholic. Unlike Gore, Kerry had a long record of support for abortion rights and repeatedly voted against the Hyde Amendment. He did, however, argue that he was personally opposed to abortion, but did not let his personal religious views interfere with the exercise of the Constitution. \u201cNow, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro-abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights,\u201d Kerry said about his support for allowing federal funding for abortions. The Hyde Amendment did not come up much during the 2008 presidential campaign. Barack Obama\u2019s lone statement on the issue came from the Reproductive Health Reality Check questionnaire sent out by Rewire News: \u201cObama does not support the Hyde amendment. He believes that the federal government should not use its dollars to intrude on a poor woman\u2019s decision whether to carry to term or to terminate her pregnancy and selectively withhold benefits because she seeks to exercise her right of reproductive choice in a manner the government disfavors.\u201d When in office, however, Obama affirmed the Hyde Amendment as part of a compromise to pass the Affordable Care Act. A group of about a dozen anti-abortion House Democrats held up passage of Obama\u2019s landmark health care bill at the last minute with demands that no federal funds for the program be used to cover abortion services. To obtain their votes, which were needed, Obama agreed to sign an executive order affirming that the Hyde Amendment principles extended to the Affordable Care Act. Hillary Clinton, the first woman nominated for president by a major party, was a longtime supporter of abortion rights and made sure the party endorsed them openly. The 2016 Democratic Party platform was the first to ever explicitly call for the end of the Hyde Amendment. The Democratic convention also featured speakers openly discussing their abortions. This development appeared to indicate that the Democratic Party would take the polar opposite position of the Republican Party on abortion. It would make a full-throated defense of abortion rights and move to roll back the restrictions imposed by their opponents. That was until Biden jumped to the top of the 2020 polls. As history shows, Biden\u2019s since-changed position on the Hyde Amendment could have made him the first Democratic Party nominee in 40 years to hold such a belief. His evolution on the issue recalls Gore\u2019s shift of just 25 years ago. Perhaps, he\u2019ll catch up to 2016 before the primary ends.",

      "author": "Mary Papenfuss",
      "content": " Attorney George Conway\u00a0lashed Republicans in a scathing op-ed\u00a0published Saturday, warning them to hold Donald Trump to the same standards they applied to Bill Clinton and take a new rape accusation against the president seriously. Conway, husband of White House senior adviser\u00a0Kellyanne Conway, pointed to Republican furor after retired Arkansas nursing home operator\u00a0Juanita Broaddrick accused Clinton of rape, which he denied.\u00a0Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by 23 women, seated Broaddrick in a front row during one of his 2016 campaign debates with Hillary Clinton. The new accusation against Trump of rape in a Bergdorf dressing room\u00a0was detailed in a New York magazine piece by renowned advice columnist E. Jean Carroll.\u00a0That accusation \u201crests upon a significantly stronger foundation than Broaddrick\u2019s,\u201d Conway argues in his piece in The Washington Post. While Carroll went public with her accusation, Broaddrick denied for years \u2014 including under oath \u2014 reports that she had been sexually assaulted by Clinton, Conway notes. Carroll\u2019s account is also \u201csupported by the sheer number of claims that have now surfaced against Trump ... [including] unwelcome or forcible sexual conduct or assault against them. These claims \u2014 all denied by the president \u2014 far outnumber the publicized sexual misconduct incidents that involved Clinton, which mostly concerned rumors or allegations of consensual affairs,\u201d he writes. (Conway represented Paula Jones, who accused Clinton of sexual harassment.) Conway says Carroll\u2019s account of the alleged sexual assault is also supported by Trump\u2019s \u201cdepraved\u201d 2005 remarks on an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape that surfaced during his 2016 campaign in which he boasts about how he treats women: \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star\u00a0... you can do anything ... grab them by the pussy.\u201d He also preened that he \u201cjust starts kissing women ... I don\u2019t even wait.\u201d Conway writes: \u201cWhatever else he may have done, Clinton never made a video like that. What Trump described on the video is exactly what Carroll says he did to her.\u201d Trump has insisted he has \u201cnever met this person in my life\u201d \u2014 which Conway slammed as another \u201cutterly brazen, easily disprovable Trumpian lie.\u201d Carroll included a photo with her article of Trump with ex-wife Ivana apparently speaking to Carroll at a gala. Conway concluded: \u201cRepublicans or conservatives who promoted Broaddrick\u2019s charges would be hypocritical if they fail to champion Carroll and condemn Trump.\u201d",

      "author": "Ed Mazza",
      "content": " Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called out Republican lawmakers Wednesday for refusing to fully investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election because they know it aided them and helped to elect President Donald Trump. She told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow that if the shoe was on the other foot, however, those same lawmakers would no doubt react very differently. As an example, she offered a hypothetical. \u201cImagine, Rachel, that you had one of the Democratic nominees for 2020 on your show and that person said, \u2018Y\u2019know, the only other adversary of ours, who\u2019s anywhere near as good as the Russians, is China. So why should Russia have all the fun? And since Russia is clearly backing Republicans, why don\u2019t we ask China to back us?\u2019\u201d Then, she got even more specific, using Trump\u2019s own words from when he called on Russia to hack her, just paraphrased slightly. \u201cChina, if you\u2019re listening, why don\u2019t you get Trump\u2019s tax returns?\u201d Clinton said in this hypothetical scenario. \u201cI\u2019m sure our media would richly reward you.\u201d During a 2016 news conference, Trump infamously said:\u00a0\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d Clinton said that, according to special counsel Robert Muller\u2019s report, such a call wouldn\u2019t be considered criminal conspiracy even if China hacked the IRS and delivered those returns to a WikiLeaks-like organization because it took place in the open.\u00a0That\u2019s what happened in 2016 when Russia hacked email accounts of people close to Clinton and delivered the messages to WikiLeaks after Trump openly called on them to hack his rival. \u201cJust saying that shows how absurd the situation we find ourselves in,\u201d Clinton said. She said that Republicans like to mention her whenever they want a distraction from real issues, such as Russian interference in the 2016 election and Trump\u2019s obstruction. \u201cThat\u2019s the real story. That\u2019s what they don\u2019t want the American people thinking about,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSo when in doubt, say something wild about me.\u201d Clinton also noted that Trump\u2019s obsession with her meant that she was \u201cliving rent-free\u201d inside the president\u2019s brain. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a very nice place to be, I can tell you that,\u201d she added.

During a Monday night town hall in New Hampshire, a student asked Warren how the presidential hopeful plans to not get \u201cHillary\u2019d\u201d \u2015 a phrase the student used to refer to the\u00a0onslaught of sexist attacks Hillary Clinton received during her 2016 campaign. Warren laughed at the student\u2019s use of \u201cHillary\u2019d\u201d before referencing her 2012 senate race, which she won against incumbent Republican Sen. Scott Brown. The senator said she was encouraged by other Democrats to run against Brown, but most blatantly told her that she shouldn\u2019t expect to actually win. \u201cPeople said to me you\u2019re gonna lose because Massachusetts in 2011, according to conventional wisdom, was not ready to have a woman senator or governor,\u201d she said. \u201cWe never had and people said it\u2019s just not gonna happen. Not at least for another generation.\u201d Warren said the comments only made her more intent on winning the Senate seat, but that didn\u2019t stop the sexist coverage of her campaign. \u201cI jumped in the race and, sure enough, the early coverage, it\u2019s about what I\u2019m wearing, it\u2019s about my hair, it\u2019s about my voice, it\u2019s about whether or not I smiled enough\u00a0\u2014 I didn\u2019t,\u201d she added, to laughter from the audience. She said she was fully committed to making \u201csomething count every single day\u201d of that race. \u201cEvery day when I saw a little girl I would come up and I\u2019d usually get down [on one knee] like a teacher, and I would say,\u00a0\u2018Hi my name is Elizabeth, and I\u2019m running for Senate because that\u2019s what girls do,\u2019\u201d Warren said to applause from the audience. \u201cAnd then we would pinky swear to remember. And so, every night when I went home\u00a0\u2014 no matter what the day had been like\u00a0\u2014 I would count how many pinky swears we had done.\u201d Warren said she plans on using hard work and persistence, as she did in the 2012 senate race, to win the 2020 primary and election. \u201cWe stay after it every day,\u201d she said. \u201cOne might say you persist.\u201d",

Speaking with reporters in Morristown, New Jersey, on Tuesday, Trump said he thought it was \u201cfine\u201d to retweet the conspiracy because it came from \u201ca very highly respected conservative pundit.\u201d But the president also appeared to try to downplay his actions, saying, \u201cThat was a retweet. That wasn\u2019t from me, that was from him.\u201d The tweets originated from Terrence K. Williams, whose Twitter bio identifies him as an actor and commentator. \u201cDied of SUICIDE on 24/7 SUICIDE WATCH ? Yeah right! How does that happen,\u201d Williams tweeted\u00a0on Saturday. \u201d#JefferyEpstein had information on Bill Clinton & now he\u2019s dead. I see #TrumpBodyCount trending but we know who did this!\u201d Williams\u2019 tweet included a video that mentions another unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that suggests the Clintons were responsible for the death of White House aide Vince Foster, who died by suicide in 1994. There is no evidence to back either conspiracy theory. Trump shared the post with his followers over the weekend. \u201cHe\u2019s a big Trump fan. ... He\u2019s a man who has half a million followers, a lot of followers, and he\u2019s respected,\u201d the president said of Williams. \u201cAnd, as you know, Bill Barr wants to do an entire investigation of the whole Epstein matter.\u201d Trump said he had \u201cno idea\u201d whether he believed Bill Clinton had anything to do with Epstein\u2019s death, according to NBC reporter Kelly O\u2019Donnell. He then questioned whether Clinton ever visited the convicted sex offender\u2019s private island. That comment appeared to hint at a second conspiracy theory Trump retweeted over the weekend.\u00a0He shared a tweet posted by an account named @BreakingNLive that claimed court documents in Epstein\u2019s case showed that Clinton \u201ctook private trips to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s \u2018pedophilia island.\u2019\u201d Epstein owned Little St. James Island, which is part of the U.S. Virgin Islands and was nicknamed \u201cpedophile island\u201d by locals, according to the Associated Press. The court documents, which were recently unsealed, include flight logs showing that Clinton flew on the financier\u2019s private jet a number of times, but the documents do not indicate that he traveled to Little St. James Island. The logs also show that Trump has flown on Epstein\u2019s jet.\u00a0Both Clinton and Trump had relationships with Epstein.",

      "content": " Hillary Clinton\u2019s brother Tony Rodham died Friday night. The 2016 presidential candidate broke the news in a tweet Saturday, mourning his passing. \u201cWe lost my brother Tony last night,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find words, my mind is flooded with memories of him today. When he walked into a room he\u2019d light it up with laughter. He was kind, generous, & a wonderful husband to Megan & father to Zach, Simon, & Fiona. We\u2019ll miss him very much.\u201d Rodham was born in 1954 to Hugh Rodham and Dorothy Howell, and was the youngest of their three children. Like his sister, Rodham also became politically involved, working for the Democratic National Convention in 1992 as then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton launched his successful presidential bid. In 2007, Rodham joined Hillary Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton appears to have had a sometimes strained relationship with Rodham, who along with his brother Hugh had jokingly become known to Clinton\u2019s White House aides as \u201cThe Brothers Rodham,\u201d according to Politico. In 2015, the outlet reported that during Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state, Rodham pushed the agency to approve visas. But that wasn\u2019t all. In 1999, a Washington Post article detailed the brothers\u2019 \u201cembarrassing business venture\u201d in which they attempted to turn a profit from harvesting hazelnuts in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. The enterprise reportedly angered then-national security adviser Sandy Berger as Aslan Abashidze, a local politician in the port city of Batumi, claimed it was an indication of \u201cpolitical support\u201d from Bill Clinton himself. Abashidze was a rival of then-Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, a U.S. ally who became irked as a result. Eventually, Berger pressured the Rodham brothers into dropping the project altogether. In 2001, The New York Times revealed\u00a0that during the end of the Clinton administration, Rodham had convinced his brother-in-law, who was serving as president, to override Justice Department objections and pardon Edgar Allen Gregory Jr. and wife Vonna Jo Gregory, a Tennessee couple found guilty of bank fraud. A congressional probe subsequently discovered that the duo had paid Rodham nearly $250,000 for work as a \u201cconsultant\u201d while they attempted to secure the pardon. In 2016, Rodham briefly appeared with Hillary Clinton during a campaign\u00a0visit to Scranton, Pennsylvania, where their father was born and raised. Rodham had three children, two with wife Megan Madden, whom he married in 2005, four years after his divorce from wife Nicole Boxer, the daughter of former California Sen. Barbara Boxer. Rodham and Boxer share a son, Zach. The cause of death has not yet been made public. Clarification: Language has been amended to reflect more accurately the parentage of Rodham\u2019s children.",

      "content": "Since the death of Jeffrey Epstein on Saturday morning, President Trump has asserted via\u00a0retweets\u00a0and\u00a0statements to the press\u00a0that former President Bill Clinton might have had something to do with the disgraced financier\u2019s hanging.\u00a0While Epstein did have connections to both Trump and Clinton,\u00a0there\u2019s absolutely no evidence that Clinton or his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, had anything to do with the apparent suicide. Trump has a long history of promoting fringe conspiracies while offering little to no evidence to support them. Similar to the Epstein case, he has even floated the idea\u00a0that the Clintons may have been involved in the 1993 suicide of former White House aide Vince Foster. In addition to targeting the Clintons, over the years, Trump-backed conspiracy theories have involved former President Barack Obama, Sen. Ted Cruz, global warming, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and wind turbines. What follows are some of the significant conspiracy theories pushed by Trump over the years.  Trump began pushing the idea that Obama was\u00a0hiding something about his true birthplace in 2011.\u00a0According to a New York Times report diving\u00a0into the six-week period in which Trump went on a media blitz casting doubt on Obama\u2019s history: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he show his birth certificate?\u201d he asked on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View.\u201d \u201cI want to see his birth certificate,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019s \u201cOn the Record.\u201d And on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday Show,\u201d he declared, \u201cI\u2019m starting to think that he was not born here.\u201d In 2012, Trump said he thought the birth certificate the White House provided could have been fake. When asked in 2015 if he believed Obama was born in the United States, Trump said, \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d Trump finally admitted at a 2016 campaign event that Obama was born in the United States but never apologized for promoting the lie.  Since losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, Trump has\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0claimed\u00a0that he was the true top vote-getter if not for millions of illegal ballots cast for his opponent by undocumented immigrants going to the polls multiple times. A comprehensive\u00a02014 report examining years of elections turned up 31\u00a0instances of credible fraud out of one billion votes cast. There have\u00a0been limited documented cases\u00a0of voter fraud in the 2016 election. Trump has also insisted he won the state of New Hampshire, which Clinton claimed by 2,736 votes, because the Democrats bussed in voters from neighboring Massachusetts. Pressed for proof of such a claim, the administration dispatched senior policy adviser Stephen Miller to defend it. \u201cI can tell you that this issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who\u2019s worked in New Hampshire politics,\u201d Miller\u00a0claimed on ABC in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s very real. It\u2019s very serious. This morning, on this show, is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence.\u201d In the more than two years since that interview, the White House has yet to find the venue in which to lay out its evidence. In 2017, Trump created a commission to investigate voter fraud and gather data to bolster its assertions, but requests to states to turn over voter registry information was\u00a0widely rejected by officials of both parties.\u00a0Trump shut down the commission in January\u00a02018, citing \u201cendless legal battles.\u201d In the wake of the 2018 midterms,\u00a0Trump alleged\u00a0\u2014 again, without evidence \u2014 that something was amiss in the recounts for the Florida Senate and gubernatorial races. Despite the president\u2019s insistence of a scheme against them, Republicans won both contests.  Last year on the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria hitting Puerto Rico, the president floated a theory that the astronomical death toll was falsified to make him look bad. \u201c3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico,\u201d\u00a0Trump tweeted\u00a0in September 2018. \u201cWhen I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000.\u201d The president\u00a0added: \u201cThis was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico The official Hurricane Maria death toll per the Puerto Rican government is 2,975, revised from the initial 64.\u00a0That number, calculated by researchers with the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, is lower than a Harvard University study released in May that put the number at 4,645. Among the other conspiracy theories pushed by Trump without any evidence: * The father of Sen. Ted Cruz\u00a0was involved in the assassination\u00a0of President John F. Kennedy. (He wasn\u2019t.) * Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was\u00a0possibly murdered\u00a0as opposed to dying from natural causes. (There\u2019s no evidence of this.) * Thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated after the attacks on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. (Police say this didn\u2019t happen.) * Global warming was a hoax\u00a0put forth by the Chinese\u00a0to hurt U.S. manufacturing. (It\u2019s not.) * The noise from wind turbines causes cancer. (It doesn\u2019t.) * The \u201cCentral Park Five\u201d \u2014 five teenagers accused of assaulting and raping a woman in 1989 \u2014 might still be guilty of the crime. (The group was\u00a0exonerated by both DNA evidence and a confession from the actual rapist.) *\u00a0Vaccines\u00a0cause autism.

      "content": " Hillary Clinton hit back in amusing style after President Donald Trump ranted about her during his 2020 reelection campaign launch in Orlando, Florida, on Tuesday night. The former secretary of state joked about being \u201cblessed with stamina\u201d to keep running through the president\u2019s mind in a Twitter exchange with Democratic former Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum. Clinton, who Trump defeated in the 2016 election, also dinged the president with a jibe about Infowars, the conspiracy theory website run by far-right personality Alex Jones. Check it out here: Trump often claimed on the 2016 campaign trail that Clinton didn\u2019t have enough stamina to be president. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the look,\u201d he said during one of their televised presidential debates. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the stamina, I said she doesn\u2019t have the stamina, and I don\u2019t believe she does have the stamina.\u201d Clinton responded at the time: As soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a ceasefire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee he can talk to me about stamina. Trump\u2019s targeting of Clinton during Tuesday\u2019s rally led to widespread mockery on Twitter, where many people accused him of failing to update his material. Former Rep. David Jolly\u00a0(R-Fla.) bashed Trump for delivering a \u201ctired, lazy, undisciplined political message focused on the grievance politics that elected him in the first place.\u201d",

      "content": " Pamela Anderson \u2015 Julian Assange\u2019s biggest celebrity advocate \u2015 is doubling down on her defense of the WikiLeaks founder, claiming his critics are scapegoating him for Hillary Clinton\u2019s election loss. In a Daily Beast op-ed published Thursday, the \u201cBaywatch\u201d actress argued that WikiLeaks\u2019 2016 release of Democratic National Committee emails did not unfairly alter the presidential race, but merely gave voters new information that may have changed their minds. \u201cThis whole saga of \u2018foreign intervention\u2019 is fundamentally absurd, and mainstream opinion painfully misguided,\u201d Anderson wrote. \u201cNo one interfered with the right of voters to inform themselves freely, choose their own candidate, and make their vote count \u2014 not Julian, not WikiLeaks, and not even the Russians.\u201d Despite Anderson\u2019s attempt to diminish Russia\u2019s actions during the election, former special counsel Robert Mueller made clear in a public statement Wednesday that \u201cthere were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election,\u201d stressing that the \u201callegation deserves the attention of every American.\u201d Furthermore, in 2018, his office released a sweeping indictment of a dozen Russian military intelligence officials, pointing to Russian hackers as the source of the DNC emails, which were delivered to Wikileaks. On that matter, Anderson told those who \u201cbelieve the culprits were Russian hackers\u201d to \u201csort it out with the Kremlin, but keep your hands off our freedom of the press!\u201d \u201cSo now you can sulk and whine all you want, but please don\u2019t blame Julian for your own defeat,\u201d she added. \u201cIf you and your lot have lost the trust of your people because they\u2019ve learned the truth about you, well then perhaps you should stop in your tracks and think.\u201d Less than two weeks ago, a northern Virginia federal grand jury indicted Assange on 17 counts of espionage involving his work with Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. Army analyst who is currently being held in Virginia\u2019s Alexandria Detention Center for refusing to testify in a grand jury\u2019s investigation of WikiLeaks. Assange worked with Manning in 2010 to publish classified information on the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars. That included a 2007 American airstrike in Baghdad that killed civilians and two Reuters journalists. Critics of Assange\u2019s arrest contend that the charges against him raise serious implications about press freedoms. Earlier this month, Anderson was the first person to pay Assange a social visit at Belmarsh, a high-security lockup in London where he is serving out a 50-week sentence for jumping bail in an attempt to avoid being extradited to the U.S. Following her visit, Anderson held a press conference outside the prison, declaring her love for Assange and calling him \u201can innocent person.\u201d",

      "content": " President Donald Trump has more than quintupled down on his baseless claims of shady voting to explain why he lost the popular vote to Democrat\u00a0Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2014 and this time he blamed Google. Trump has repeatedly insisted \u2014 with no evidence \u2014 that 3 million (maybe as many as 5 million) votes were illegally cast by noncitizens. Three million happens to be close to Clinton\u2019s popular vote margin over Trump. But now Trump is insisting that up to 16 million votes were manipulated by Google to Clinton\u2019s benefit. \u201cMy victory was even bigger than thought!\u201d he gushed on Twitter. The claim comes just days after Ellen Weintraub, the chair of the Federal Election Commission, wrote a letter to the president telling him to shut up about his vote-fraud claims or come up with evidence that there\u2019s any truth to them. Trump established an investigative panel on voter fraud to substantiate his claims in 2017, but it came up with nothing and disbanded. Weintraub warned that Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claims undermine faith in the election system. She said she was using words a \u201cformer casino operator\u201d could understand: \u201cYou need to lay your cards on the table \u2014 or fold.\u201d Instead of folding, Trump raised. Trump\u2019s new claim was apparently sparked by a Fox Business report Monday about psychologist Robert Epstein\u2019s research. He recently testified before senators that his research has shown that Google\u2019s search algorithms may have \u201cimpacted undecided voters in a way that gave at least 2.6 million votes to Clinton.\u201d His study sample, however, involved just 95 voters, 21 of whom considered themselves undecided. Google denied that its search algorithms are politically biased and has said that Epstein\u2019s study methodology was fatally flawed. \u201cThis researcher\u2019s inaccurate claim has been debunked since it was made in 2016,\u201d Google said in a statement to CNBC. \u201cAs we stated then, we have never re-ranked or altered search results to manipulate political sentiment.\u201d Clinton made much of the 21 undecided voters in Epstein\u2019s research in a Twitter clapback.",

Terrence K. Williams, whose Twitter bio identifies him as an actor, wrote a tweet with hashtags related to one of the conspiracy theories. The president later shared the post with his followers. \u201cDied of SUICIDE on 24/7 SUICIDE WATCH ? Yeah right! How does that happen,\u201d Williams wrote. \u201d#JefferyEpstein had information on Bill Clinton & now he\u2019s dead. I see #TrumpBodyCount trending but we know who did this!\u201d In a video uploaded with the tweet, Williams goes on to link Epstein\u2019s death to another unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that suggests the Clintons were responsible for the death of White House aide Vince Foster, who died by suicide in 1994. There is no evidence proving the longstanding conspiracy theory called the \u201cClinton Body Count,\u201d which tries to link the family to a number of deaths.\u00a0Snopes, the fact-checking news site,\u00a0extensively debunked the false claims when they first surfaced. Trump also retweeted an account named @BreakingNLive that claimed the court documents involving Epstein\u2019s case, which were unsealed this week, showed that Bill Clinton \u201ctook private trips to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s \u2018pedophilia island.\u2019\u201d However, the tweet is misleading. The court documents, unsealed this week, include flight logs that show Clinton flew on the financier\u2019s private jet a number of times, but the documents do not indicate that Clinton traveled to a \u201cpedophilia island,\u201d nor do they contain the words \u201cpedophilia island.\u201d However, the court filings do mention that Epstein frequently traveled to the Caribbean. Epstein owned Little St. James Island, which is part of the U.S. Virgin Islands and was nicknamed \u201cpedophile island\u201d by locals, according to the Associated Press. The documents similarly do not indicate that Clinton traveled to Little St. James Island. The logs also show that Trump has flown on Epstein\u2019s jet. Both Clinton and Trump had relationships with Epstein, who was known to be well-connected to powerful people. Clinton, a longtime associate of Epstein\u2019s, said last month that he did not know anything about the \u201cterrible crimes\u201d that Epstein committed and said they haven\u2019t spoken in \u201cwell over a decade.\u201d Also last month, Trump, who has appeared in photos and video with Epstein at events and parties, said that he had a \u201cfalling out\u201d with Epstein and was \u201cnot a fan of his.\u201d A Trump official,\u00a0Lynne Patton, a regional administrator for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, also shared an unfounded conspiracy theory after Epstein\u2019s death. In an Instagram post, Patton suggested that Epstein was \u201cHillary\u2019d,\u201d implying \u2014 with no proof \u2014 that Hillary Clinton was responsible for his death. Before Patton was assigned to work in the administration, she worked closely with the Trump family, planning events, including Eric Trump\u2019s wedding, and eventually becoming the Trump family\u2019s chief of staff.",

Now, McCain is blaming a boozy outing for her caustic comments, according to a new profile in Elle magazine. The night before that episode, McCain said she had drinks with her colleagues and got \u201ctipsy,\u201d in the words of the magazine. She claimed she was still feeling the effects of the outing the next morning when she said on the show, \u201cI call her Crooked Hillary! I hate Hillary Clinton.\u201d She told Elle she still regrets the comments. \u201cI apologized on TV and said that I was contributing to the polarization of this country,\u201d she said, before referencing her father, the late Sen. John McCain. \u201cShe was friends with my dad.

But the sit-down never materialized. \u201cWhat if Hillary had come on and, forget politics for a second, but what if we could have talked about her humanity, why she got into public service?\u201d asked Stern, who declared his support for Clinton ahead of the election despite his long history of inviting Trump to appear on his show. He then suggested some questions he could have asked to \u201chumanize\u201d her: \u201cHere is a woman who dedicated her whole life to public service. What was her life like as a little girl growing up? What was her romance with Bill Clinton? What was she thinking when she was Secretary of State? What was she thinking when she was the First Lady?

It should be something undertaken in a really serious ... way based on evidence,\u201d she continued. Though some Democrats, including 2020 presidential contenders Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kamala Harris (Calif.), have made concrete statements in support of impeaching Trump, Pelosi has taken a more measured approach. In a letter to her colleagues Monday, Pelosi acknowledged efforts to seek impeachment against the president in light of the \u201chighly unethical and unscrupulous behavior\u201d conducted by Trump, as laid out in the Mueller report. \u201cAs you know, last Thursday\u2019s release of the redacted Mueller Report has caused a public outcry for truth and accountability,\u201d Pelosi said in her letter.\u00a0\u201cWhile our views range from proceeding to investigate the finding of the Mueller report or proceeding directly to impeachment, we all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth.\u201d Clinton on Tuesday compared a potential Trump impeachment to the impeachment of President Richard Nixon in 1974. Many public hearings involving Nixon administration officials took place before the House initiated impeachment proceedings against him, she noted. As a staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee at the time, Clinton researched the historical grounds for impeachment and helped draft a memo on what constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors. \u201cI have a kind of weird personal history about impeachment,\u201d Clinton said during the Time summit. \u201cIt took several years for the slow acquisition and the publication of information to show the level of corruption and obstruction that was existing in [the Nixon] White House. ... By the end of it, the evidence was overwhelming.\u201d Clinton said the Mueller report \u201ccould not be more explicit\u201d in laying out evidence that Trump obstructed justice, adding that \u201cany other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted\u201d if not for the Justice Department determination that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Nonetheless, she said, Congress must investigate and examine the evidence \u201cas objectively as possible\u201d before deciding to move forward with impeachment. \u201cI think Nancy is right to be cautious about making sure whatever is done in this Congress is more in accord with the very careful approach of 1973 and \u201974,\u201d Clinton said, referring to the Nixon impeachment proceedings. \u201cYou don\u2019t put impeachment on the table as the only item on the table. ... Instead, you say, \u2018We are going to proceed with the seriousness this demands.\u2019\u201d",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.). All four are women of color, but only one \u2014 Omar \u2014 was born outside of the United States. The lawmaker was born in Somalia and immigrated to the U.S. when she was a child. Clinton has become a vocal and noted critic of the president since her defeat in 2016, lambasting his frequent invocations of her name, chastising him for spreading \u201csexist trash\u201d and accusing the Trump administration of conducting \u201cdespicable\u201d acts. She has vowed to \u201ccontinue to speak out and fight for our basic rights,\u201d even if it sometimes irks those in Washington. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also came to her colleagues\u2019 defense on Sunday, accusing the president of \u201cxenophobic comments meant to divide our nation.\u201d Republicans, on the other hand, have largely stayed silent. The hosts of \u201cFox & Friends\u201d went so far as to applaud Trump\u2019s remarks on Sunday. Despite the outcry, Trump doubled down on his remarks later that evening, saying it was \u201cso sad to see the Democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country.\u201d \u201cTheir disgusting language and the many terrible things they say about the United States must not be allowed to go unchallenged,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIf the Democrat Party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior, then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in 2020!\u201d",

On Friday, The Washington Post debunked the footage as a hit job, though its origins remain unclear.\u00a0A version shared on a Facebook page called Politics WatchDog continued to remain available with 2.6 million views as of Saturday, and the social media platform has no plans to take it down. Though the company has vowed to combat the sharing of fake news on its site, in a statement to The Guardian, a company spokesperson said it was trying to uphold free speech by leaving the edited clip up: There\u2019s a tension here: we work hard to find the right balance between encouraging free expression and promoting a safe and authentic community, and we believe that reducing the distribution of inauthentic content strikes that balance. But just because something is allowed to be on Facebook doesn\u2019t mean it should get distribution. In other words, we allow people to post it as a form of expression, but we\u2019re not going to show it at the top of News Feed. On Twitter, the video was shared by the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who later deleted his post then tweeted out an unintelligible comment\u00a0appearing to defend his decision to spread the footage. Trump himself tweeted a separate video of Pelosi on Wednesday, titling it, \u201cPelosi stammers through news conference.\u201d The Post determined the clip had been selectively edited, but it is still on the president\u2019s page.",

On Tuesday, the singer tweeted a short clip of various 2016 presidential hopefuls, including Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), about to observe the national anthem at a Democratic presidential debate. However, the video features Lizzo\u2019s song \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d as the anthem. \u201cWhy men great \u2019til they gotta be great? Woo,\u201d Lizzo sings as Clinton, Sanders and others hold their hands over their hearts. The next day, Clinton responded to the tweet with the opening of the song\u2019s first verse: \u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out...\u201d The full lyric is \u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out I\u2019m 100% that bitch.\u201d Sadly, Clinton did not tweet that part. It\u2019s not clear why Clinton (or her team) chose to respond to this tweet in this way, but relating with singers and rappers seems to be all the rage these days. Rapper Cardi B has long been an admirer of Sanders, and last week the senator\u2019s team released a video of her interviewing him about police reform, minimum wage and health care. And earlier this month, the team of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tweeted a line from \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d in response to a now-unavailable tweet.

Again,\u201d she dryly tweeted \u2014 clearly referencing Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election. Clinton attached a clip of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s meltdown in a CNN interview Thursday when he said that \u201cof course\u201d he called on Ukrainian officials recently to investigate\u00a0Biden, after initially denying it. Clinton\u2019s attack was one of several in the wake of a Wall Street Journal article published Friday which reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cabout eight times\u201d in a July phone call to\u00a0work with Giuliani on an investigation of\u00a0the former vice president\u2019s actions as well as those of his son, Hunter. Giuliani has claimed that Biden worked when he was vice president to shield a Ukrainian energy company linked to Hunter from a corruption probe. A Ukrainian official said earlier this year there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by either Biden. Trump\u2019s request for a Ukrainian investigation into the Bidens is part of a secret complaint filed against the president by a whistleblower in the intelligence community, The New York Times reported Friday. Trump hasn\u2019t denied pressing Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. He has described the call with Zelensky as \u201cbeautiful,\u201d and said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter what I discussed.\u201d The possibility of a president leveraging the power of the U.S. government on a foreign country to probe a political rival to help his reelection has begun to trigger calls for impeachment. Former Texas Rep.\u00a0Beto O\u2019Rourke, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development\u00a0Julian Castro, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\u00a0and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren appeared to be the first of the Democratic presidential contenders to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment over the matter on Friday. Like Clinton, both O\u2019Rourke and Warren referred to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) said Trump should be impeached if he is blocking the whistleblower complaint from being released to congressional investigators. Richard Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, tweeted: \u201cImpeach NOW.\u201d",

      "content": " Hillary Clinton paid a visit to an art exhibition in Venice, Italy, that involved her sitting at a mock Resolute Desk and reading copies of her now-infamous emails. Images cropped up online Wednesday showing the 2016 Democratic nominee for president in Despar Teatro Italia, which is currently hosting a solo exhibition by the artist and poet Kenneth Goldsmith called \u201cHILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails.\u201d Goldsmith told HuffPost via email that Clinton\u2019s visit \u201cwas a surprise,\u201d while curator Francesco Urbano Ragazzi said organizers thought the possibility of her visiting was a joke. \u201cSomeone close to Mrs. Clinton contacted us very informally a few days before her visit. We realized that it wasn\u2019t a joke only when we saw the security service inside the exhibition space at 9 am on Tuesday,\u201d they told HuffPost via email. Goldsmith\u2019s exhibition makes public \u201cfor the first time in printed format\u201d some 60,000 pages of Clinton\u2019s emails, which, per WikiLeaks, \u201cwere sent from the domain clintonemail.com between 2009 and 2013,\u201d according to the description from exhibit co-organizer Zuecca Projects. Then-candidate Donald Trump turned the emails, which were stored on a private server while Clinton was secretary of state, into rallying cry during the 2016 election. The documents are being displayed in an environment that \u201cconverts in a lo-fi format some of the furnishings of the Oval Office in the White House,\u201d the description says. \u201cEverybody was very excited [during Clinton\u2019s visit],\u201d Urbano Ragazzi said. \u201cI think the scene was so extraordinary that many customers believed that she was just a lookalike at first.\u201d The description explains that \u201cthe pile of papers is rather unimpressive, rebutting Trump\u2019s efforts to make them monumental.\u201d \u201cIn this way, Goldsmith creates an anti-monument to the folly of Trump\u2019s heinous smear campaign against Clinton,\u201d it concludes. The artist shared on Twitter that Clinton read her emails for an hour and, per a translation from an Italian news outlet, said: \u201cThis exhibition is further proof that nothing wrong or controversial can be found on these emails. It makes them accessible to everyone and allows everyone to read them.\u201d He also recalled Clinton saying, as an aside, to Urbano Ragazzi: \u201cThey are just so boring.\u201d Goldsmith told HuffPost that he \u201choped that she would see it as an act of tribute and love,\u201d which he believes she did. Urbano Ragazzi added that organizers wanted Clinton to \u201cunderstand the intentions\u201d of the project. \u201cIn the digital age, making these documents available to everyone in a touchable format is a way to focus on something concrete in order to exit the impalpable toxicity of ideological narratives,\u201d they said, before adding: \u201cThe exhibition is a way to allude to an alternative world that will never exist. We are happy that the real Hillary has been part of this image full of possibilities.\u201d The exhibition, which began in May, runs until Nov. 24.\u00a0It is curated by Francesco Urbano Ragazzi and organized by The Internet Saga and Zuecca Projects with collaboration and support from Circuitozero, The Bauers, NERO and Despar Aspiag Service. Clinton did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment, but the former senator tweeted some thoughts about the whole thing on Thursday: This article has been updated with Clinton\u2019s tweet.",

      "author": "Dominique Mosbergen",
      "content": " The Trump administration is reportedly amping up its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private emails \u2014 reviving a controversial topic that dominated headlines during the 2016 presidential election and one that President Donald Trump continues to mention. The Washington Post reported on Saturday that the State Department is investigating the email records of dozens of current and former officials who sent messages to Clinton\u2019s private email account when she was secretary of state. The New York Times confirmed the continuation of the investigation on Sunday. State Department investigators began contacting officials about the emails some 18 months ago, the Post reported. But the effort was apparently dropped before being revived in August. \u201cAs many as 130\u201d officials have been contacted by the Trump administration since then, the paper said, adding that\u00a0\u201cthose targeted were notified that emails they sent years ago have been retroactively classified and now constitute potential security violations.\u201d The emails were largely sent between 2009 and 2013, when Clinton was secretary of state under former President Barack Obama. State Department officials denied to the Post that the probe was politically motivated. But one former senior U.S. official familiar with the investigation described it as a way for Republicans \u201cto keep the Clinton email issue alive.\u201d Trump, for one, has not dropped the matter. Just Wednesday, Trump \u2015 who\u2019s facing an impeachment inquiry following a series of troubling revelations related to a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2015\u00a0touted a baseless conspiracy theory about Clinton\u2019s emails. \u201cI think one of the great crimes committed is Hillary Clinton deleting 33,000 emails after Congress sends her a subpoena,\u201d Trump told reporters\u00a0in New York while sitting alongside Zelensky\u00a0ahead of a bilateral meeting, referring to a cache of emails that was deleted by a Clinton aide in 2014. Trump suggested those emails \u201ccould very well\u201d be in Ukraine. Clinton came under scrutiny during the 2016 presidential election for her use of a private email server to conduct State Department business \u2015 and her choice to delete emails that she\u2019d deemed personal rather than turning them over to investigators. Then-FBI Director James Comey said Clinton and her aides had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in their handling of classified information but ultimately recommended the case be closed with no charges. Comey also said the FBI had found no evidence that the 33,000 deleted emails had been \u201cintentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\u201d Some of the emails were recovered by intelligence officials, NBC News noted. Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee for president, has said she believes Comey\u2019s decision to send a letter to Congress about the email controversy mere days before the presidential election was a major factor contributing to her loss. \u201cAbsent that, I believe the evidence shows I would have won,\u201d Clinton said in 2017.",

      "content": " Hillary Clinton\u00a0served Facebook\u00a0a fresh round of criticism Tuesday for its role in providing President Donald Trump with a massive platform for his reelection fight, which reportedly includes fake endorsements, money-making scams and deceptive information. At the \u201cIn Defense of American Democracy\u201d conference at George Washington University, Clinton sounded the alarm on \u201cTrump\u2019s propaganda efforts,\u201d citing a \u201cvery disturbing\u201d investigation into his advertising by journalist Judd Legum. \u201cThe Trump campaign is already spending hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars on Facebook each week to spread fake endorsements and outright lies about Democrats,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have been doing this since after the 2017 inauguration, but it\u2019s getting at an even higher velocity now.\u201d Clinton added that \u201ceven though these posts violate Facebook\u2019s stated terms of service, they\u2019re still up.\u201d \u201cFacebook is still paid for them. And the people who are targeted to receive them still believe them,\u201d she said. Facebook did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. According to Legum\u2019s newsletter, Popular Information, the Trump campaign has used stock photo models to offer phony endorsements in Facebook videos. The attractive models smile as voiceovers offer support for the president. In a NowThis feature on his reporting, Legum said that the campaign has also used Facebook ads to ask voters to make an immediate donation in order to enter contests to win items such as a signed \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. The contests are said to have enrollment deadlines of 11:59 p.m. on that given day \u2015 but they actually are promoted for multiple days or even weeks, Legum said. The ads are designed, he said, to \u201cscam\u201d Trump supporters. The often politically divisive sentiments pushed by Trump\u2019s ads have also raised concerns. Following the shooting last month in which a gunman targeting Mexicans killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas \u2015 having allegedly acted on a white supremacist manifesto decrying a \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d \u2015 a review of Trump\u2019s campaign ads showed he used the same language to describe immigration. Earlier this year, about 2,200 ads claimed an \u201cinvasion\u201d was taking place, many of them warning social media users that \u201cillegal immigration is a serious threat to our country.\u201d Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that the conference was held at George Washington University but was not sponsored by the school.",

A summary of the leaders\u2019 call released earlier in the day revealed Trump asked Zelensky to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential contender Biden. Trump made the request while discussing U.S. military aid to Ukraine. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday\u00a0called for a formal impeachment inquiry\u00a0in the wake of the allegations that Trump urged a foreign power to go after his political rival. When a reporter asked Trump Wednesday if he would like Zelensky to continue investigating Biden, Trump said he wanted him \u201cto do whatever he can.\u201d \u201cI want him to do whatever he can, this was not his fault, he wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Trump said of Zelensky. \u201cBut whatever he can do in terms of corruption, because corruption\u2019s rampant. Now when Joe Biden\u2019s son walks away with millions of dollars from Ukraine and he knows nothing and they\u2019re paying him millions of dollars, that\u2019s corruption.\u201d Trump was referring to a Ukrainian investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings while he was serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. The Ukrainian prosecutor in the case found no evidence of wrongdoing. Trump then pivoted to former 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, saying they should be investigated. He accused the U.S. government of being \u201ccorrupt,\u201d defended using his personal lawyer as an envoy to Ukraine, and said Zelensky should give more money to the U.S. He then attacked Pelosi for opening an impeachment investigation. \u201cShe\u2019s lost her way,\u201d Trump said of Pelosi. \u201cShe\u2019s been taken over by the radical left.\u201d He ended by saying that Pelosi is no longer speaker of the House.

      "content": " Hillary Clinton couldn\u2019t get away from the issue of a private email server in the 2016 election. Donald Trump said it was \u201cbigger than Watergate\u201d and she deserved to go to jail for it. Now, Trump has been caught using a secret computer system \u2015 a private server, if you will \u2015 to hide his election interference attempts. \u201cRepublicans have made it very clear that secret servers are a criminal offense,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who served on the Clinton campaign. \u201cWill they apply the same rules to Trump that they apply to everyone else?\u201d An explosive letter\u00a0from an unnamed intelligence official was released Thursday detailing attempts by the White House to cover up Trump\u2019s wrongdoing. On more than one occasion, White House officials put transcripts of Trump\u2019s conversations into a \u201cstandalone computer system\u201d that was meant for storing sensitive and classified intelligence information. Officials were abusing that system, the letter says. They used it to protect politically sensitive conversations, rather than national security secrets. It\u2019s the place they put the transcript of Trump\u2019s conversation with the president of Ukraine when he asked for foreign help in going after former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Hiding this transcript was deliberate. According to the whistleblower\u2019s letter, White House officials said they were \u201cdirected\u201d by White House lawyers to move it there, away from the regular computer system that holds other call transcripts that are distributed to Cabinet-level officials. As secretary of state, Clinton used a private email account connected to a nongovernment server. Clinton said it was for convenience, so that she wouldn\u2019t have to carry around two phones \u2015 one for government work and one for personal use. And her aides said she was careful about how she handled classified information. The setup, however, also gave her and her aides control over what materials were preserved for public records. Clinton was not the first government official to use a personal email address for government work. But the issue dogged her relentlessly, pushed on by Trump and his conservative allies. There\u2019s no evidence that Clinton set up this system to deliberately hide wrongdoing.\u00a0But according to the whistleblower, Trump\u2019s White House used its second system for exactly those reasons. The call at the center of this issue is Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. According to both the whistleblower letter and a summary of the call released by the White House, Trump pressured Zelensky to have his government investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. In the Aug. 12 complaint, the whistleblower wrote that there were White House officials who were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the call, adding, \u201cThey told me that there was already a \u2018discussion ongoing\u2019 with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials\u2019 retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.\u201d And if there were any doubt that the White House knew it was bad, officials moved the transcript to the secret system so that few people would ever know about it. \u201cIn the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to \u2018lock down\u2019 all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced \u2015 as is customary \u2015 by the White House Situation Room,\u201d the whistleblower wrote. \u201cThis set of actions underscored to me that the White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d",

Clinton, appearing Monday on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d\u00a0alongside daughter\u00a0Chelsea Clinton, was asked by host Stephen Colbert\u00a0about the bombshell\u00a0leak earlier that day in which it was revealed Pompeo had been present on a controversial July 25 phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The summary\u00a0of that call released by the White House demonstrated that the president pushed the foreign leader to help dig up dirt on his political opponent Joe Biden. A week before, he had ordered the delay of more than $390 million in military aid to Ukraine. \u201cHow many times when you were secretary of state did you have to say to Barack Obama: \u2018You can\u2019t extort foreign countries\u2019?\u201d Stephen Colbert asked.\u00a0\u201cDid you lose count how many times you did that?\u201d Clinton, who was Trump\u2019s 2016 Democratic rival, had plenty to say in response, but to summarize, the answer (after first responding with a big laugh) was, \u201cYeah... that never happened.\u201d The mother-daughter duo appeared on the show as part of a string of media appearances to plug their new book, \u201cGutsy Women.\u201d Watch the segment from \u201cThe Late Show\u201d below:",
