      "content": " Donald Trump lavished praise Thursday on his \u201cfriend\u201d and \u201chell of a leader\u201d\u00a0 Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the Turkish president launched an incursion into northeast Syria. Trump said the Turks needed to have a swath of Syria \u201ccleaned out\u201d after battling with Syrian Kurds there. Trump spoke after Turkey announced a five-day \u201cpause\u201d in fighting in Syria negotiated by Vice President Mike Pence. The deal was reached just over a week after Trump agreed in a phone call with Erdogan to pull out U.S. troops\u00a0in Syria to cede the battlefield to the Turks, who have targeted America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Pence has termed the new deal a \u201cceasefire,\u201d but the Turkish foreign minister called it a \u201cpause,\u201d emphasizing: \u201cThis is not a ceasefire,\u201d and said that Turkish troops would not withdraw. Turkey will pause its invasion for 120 hours to allow the Kurds to withdraw from a zone of the border region. But the agreement also allows Turkey to take over a significant swath of Syria and calls on Syrian Kurdish forces, known as the YPG, to surrender their heavy weapons. The deal would suspend U.S. economic sanctions against Turkey. \u201cFor many, many years, Turkey, in all fairness, they\u2019ve had a legitimate problem\u201d with northeast Syria, where the Kurds are settled, Trump said in remarks in Texas ahead of his rally in Dallas. \u201cThey had terrorists, they had a lot of people in there they couldn\u2019t have \u2026. and they had to have it cleaned out.\u201d (See the video above.) The Kurds have battled ISIS for years alongside U.S. troops \u2014 and have fought against Turkey for centuries over disputed territory. Now that the ethnic group is under siege, the destabilization has \u201ccreated a perfect situation for ISIS to capitalize on,\u201d Rita Katz, executive director of the SITE Intelligence Group, a private firm that tracks online extremist activity, told The Washington Post. Trump said in Texas: \u201cI want to thank Turkey\u201d for agreeing to the pause in fighting \u2014 even though it was Turkey that launched the invasion. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten everything we\u2019ve ever dreamed of,\u201d Trump added. He said the Kurds are \u201cincredibly happy\u201d with the \u201csolution.\u201d Trump said the \u201cceasefire\u201d was something that Turkey had been after for 10 years. \u201cYou would have lost millions and millions of lives. They couldn\u2019t get it without a little \u2018rough love,\u2019 as I called it ... they needed a little bit of that at the beginning,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd then everybody said, \u2018Wow, this is tougher than we thought.\u2019 When those guns start shooting, they tend to do things.\u201d Trump called it a \u201cgreat day for the United States. It\u2019s a great day for Turkey ... The Kurds were great. Great day for the Kurds. It\u2019s really a great day for civilization.\u201d On Wednesday Trump said that the Kurdish allies were \u201cno angels\u201d and said that in some cases they represent a threat more dangerous than ISIS, whom the Kurds fought against with American troops in Syria. He stated that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria \u201chas nothing to do with us.\u201d The House on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly,\u00a0354 to 60, to denounce the U.S. troop withdrawal in Syria;\u00a0129 Republicans joined all the Democrats in the vote on the resolution.",

      "author": "Josephine Harvey",
      "content": " President Donald Trump warned Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan not to be a \u201ctough guy\u201d or a \u201cfool\u201d in a letter sent as Turkey launched its invasion on northern Syria. A senior White House official has confirmed that the Oct. 9 letter, released Wednesday, is authentic. \u201cDear Mr. President: Let\u2019s work out a good deal! You don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2015 and I will,\u201d the letter begins, before going on to say that the Kurds are willing to negotiate. Trump finalizes the letter by urging the Turkish leader to deal with the issue in the right and humane way, concluding with: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d The letter was written on the same day as Turkish military began attacking Kurdish forces, which were allied with the U.S. in the battle against the self-described Islamic State. Days earlier, Trump had\u00a0ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region, a decision which was met with bipartisan condemnation. In an Oct. 6 statement, the White House announced the decision, saying that Trump had spoken with Erdogan over the phone. \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria,\u201d the statement from the White House read. \u201cThe United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u2018Caliphate,\u2019 will no longer be in the immediate area.\u201d The following day, Trump addressed his decision via tweet, warning Turkey not to do anything that he considered to be \u201coff limits\u201d \u2015 and threatening to destroy its economy if it did so. He defended his widely condemned decision to effectively greenlight Turkey\u2019s invasion, which severely jeopardizes the lives of the U.S.-allied Kurdish forces and risks the re-emergence of ISIS, by saying that it was now up to Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds to \u201cfigure the situation out.\u201d \u201cFighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East,\u201d he wrote in a string of tweets. \u201cThe stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\u201d On Monday, Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions and visa bans on top Turkish officials as a mode of punishment for their invasion of Syria. He said he had also increased tariffs on Turkish steel imports and would immediately halt negotiations on a major trade deal with the country. He also said a small number of U.S. troops would remain in Syria. The Senate is working to introduce its own sanctions bill against Turkey, saying that Trump\u2019s orders are insufficient. Before the release of the letter Wednesday, the president muddied the waters further, undercutting the longstanding alliance between the Kurdish forces and the U.S. during a news conference, in which he said the Kurds are \u201cnot angels\u201d and that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria was \u201cnot our problem\u201d \u2015 even as Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were scheduled to travel to Turkey that day to negotiate a ceasefire. In a meeting earlier in the day with Democratic leaders in Congress to discuss the president\u2019s handling of the Turkey crisis, Trump bragged about the \u201cnasty\u201d letter he sent to Erdogan, according to a senior aide cited by NBC News. When asked in the meeting by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) what his plan was to contain ISIS and whether it entailed relying on the Syrians and the Turks, Schumer said the president replied, \u201cTo keep the American people safe.\u201d Erdogan said Wednesday that he would not meet with Pence and Pompeo unless Trump came, but his communications director later clarified that he would meet with the U.S. delegation. Erdogan vowed to press on with the offensive in northern Syria until his mission to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d was complete and the region was cleared of Kurdish forces. He maintained Tuesday that Turkey would \u201cnever declare a ceasefire,\u201d saying that he was not worried about any sanctions. S.V. Date contributed reporting.",

Mentz\u2019s author page on Amazon suggests that he is a prolific writer, with more than 60 titles to his name. That includes works with titles like \u201cThe Law of Attraction & Prosperity Bible \u2013 The Illuminati Wealth Manifesto & Codex\u201d and \u201cThe Illuminati Handbook \u2013 The Path of Illumination and Ascension.\u201d In a 2013 book by \u201cMagus Incognito\u201d called \u201cRosicrucian and Masonic Spirituality & Secrets \u2013 The Handbook,\u201d Mentz tells readers the book\u2019s teachings \u201ccan propel the initiate into the 4th dimension of existence on this Earth.\u201d Mentz told The Denver Post that he uses \u201cIlluminati\u201d in book titles primarily for marketing purposes. \u201cJust because I use the word Illuminati, don\u2019t let that get you too excited,\u201d Mentz told the paper in an interview published Wednesday. \u201cIf you look the word up, it means \u2018illumination.\u2019 How to be more aware, conscious, a better person.\u201d In addition to his work as an author, Mentz pens finance columns for the conservative website Newsmax, and teaches online financial planning courses for Texas A&M University.

      "subtitle": "The energy secretary said Trump\u2019s lawyer offered debunked conspiracy theories on Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election, The Wall Street Journal reports.",
      "author": "Sanjana Karanth",
      "content": " Energy Secretary Rick Perry reportedly called President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u00a0earlier this year to address the president\u2019s concerns about alleged corruption in Ukraine. Perry told The Wall Street Journal, in an interview published Wednesday, that Trump directed him this spring to seek out Giuliani, who pushed debunked conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election instead of acknowledging that there had been Russian interference. Perry said he contacted Giuliani as a way to set the stage for a meeting between Trump and newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to the Journal. The energy secretary\u2019s meeting adds to a growing picture of Giuliani working with Cabinet officials to push Ukraine to launch investigations. The former Texas governor became publicly linked to the Trump-Ukraine scandal earlier this month after sources familiar with the situation told Axios that Perry arranged Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky and that the president said so in a recent conference call with House Republicans. \u201cThe only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to,\u201d Trump reportedly said, according to Axios. \u201cSomething about an LNG [liquefied natural gas] plant.\u201d In the call with Zelensky, which is at the center of the House impeachment inquiry, Trump asked the Ukrainian president to interfere in the 2020 election by\u00a0investigating political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Trump also alleged that Ukraine has Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, asking Zelensky to look into cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, which\u00a0was hired to investigate the hack of the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Perry\u2019s phone call with Giuliani reportedly came after a White House meeting in May after Zelensky\u2019s inauguration, according to the Journal. Officials at the meeting, including Perry and then-U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, encouraged Trump to meet the new president, but Trump said that they needed to work with Giuliani to resolve the lawyer\u2019s concerns about Ukraine. Perry reportedly understood those concerns to be related to Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Giuliani has been specifically pushing the conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine and not Russia that interfered in the 2016 election. Former special counsel Robert Mueller and the U.S. intelligence community investigated and found that Russia had interfered in the election to help Trump win. Perry told the Journal that some of the conspiracy theories that Giuliani related in their call included that Ukraine was responsible for a dossier on Trump\u2019s alleged ties to Russia, that Ukraine had Clinton\u2019s email server and that the country\u2019s government made up false evidence to send former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to jail. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that was crap or what,\u201d Perry told the newspaper. \u201cI\u2019m just saying there were three things that he said. That\u2019s the reason the president doesn\u2019t trust these [Ukrainian] guys.\u201d The three House committees in charge of leading the impeachment inquiry\u00a0subpoenaed Perry last week, demanding that the energy secretary turn over documents related to the Trump administration\u2019s communications with Ukraine. \u201cRecently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the President\u2019s stark message to the Ukrainian President,\u201d the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees wrote Oct. 10. The letter also said the reports bring up questions \u201cabout your efforts to press Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company to benefit individuals involved with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s push to get Ukrainian officials to interfere in our 2020 election.\u201d Perry has to respond to House subpoenas by Friday. The energy secretary also\u00a0has denied reports that he is expected to resign by the end of the year.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Republicans are apoplectic about Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, calling it a shameful betrayal of the Kurds to a deadly Turkish invasion that could lead to a resurgence of the Islamic State in the Middle East. But ask them what Congress \u2015 an independent institution charged with oversight of the executive branch \u2015 ought to do to remedy the situation, and they scratch their heads, unable to come up with an answer. \u201cIt\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s such a big problem right now, it\u2019s going to take some time to unravel what the next step should be,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Wednesday. Even Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), one of Trump\u2019s biggest critics who called the situation in Syria a \u201cvery dark moment in American history,\u201d struggled to name a solution. \u201cWe\u2019ve created an extraordinary mess, and the path forward is certainly unclear,\u201d Romney told reporters on Capitol Hill. On the table is a bipartisan sanctions bill introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) that would unleash a series of economic sanctions against Turkey for its incursion into Syria, where a number of human rights violations have been reported following Trump\u2019s decision to effectively greenlight the invasion by pulling U.S. troops out of northern Syria. It\u2019s not clear, however, how much support there is for such a bill, nor whether it would prove effective. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has notably not committed to bringing it to the floor for a vote. Nor has the Kentucky Republican said whether he\u2019ll allow a vote on a nonbinding bipartisan, bicameral resolution opposing Trump\u2019s Syria policy that passed in the House on Wednesday by a 354-60 vote. \u201cTurkey is a NATO ally, and we don\u2019t want to totally fracture our relationship with them. We don\u2019t want to further drive them into the arms of the Russians,\u201d McConnell said at a weekly news conference Wednesday. Though McConnell voiced support for the Kurds and expressed his hope that a Thursday trip by Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Turkey \u201ccan somehow repair the damage\u201d in the region, he made no remarks during an explosive meeting with Trump and other top congressional lawmakers at the White House on Wednesday afternoon. During that discussion in the Cabinet Room, Trump berated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) after she spoke out against the president\u2019s handling of the Syria crisis. Trump, according to Pelosi, had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d and offered no strategy for dealing with the situation going forward. Only two Republicans spoke in the meeting: Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas. Earlier Wednesday, Trump further undermined the long-standing alliance between U.S. and Kurdish forces who have been fighting alongside each other against ISIS in Syria. The president said that the Kurds are \u201cnot angels\u201d and that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria is \u201cnot our problem.\u201d The Trump administrations\u2019 abrupt foreign policy shift in the Middle East has brought bipartisan backlash from lawmakers, including top Trump ally Graham. The South Carolina Republican warned Trump was committing the \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency\u201d by abandoning the Kurds, but he held out hope that Trump might yet correct course on Syria. \u201cI fear this is a complete and utter national security disaster in the making, and I hope President Trump will adjust his thinking,\u201d Graham tweeted Wednesday. Democrats, meanwhile, were skeptical that Republicans might take more drastic action in seeking to force Trump to alter course in the Middle East.\u00a0As chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, for example, Graham could hold up the president\u2019s nominations to federal courts as leverage over the president. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee could also hold hearings into the matter. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely to happen. Come on. Take a look around,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Senate Republicans voted Thursday to advance another of President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominees, Justin Walker, who earned a rare and embarrassing \u201cnot qualified\u201d rating from the American Bar Association. Every Republican on the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Walker, the president\u2019s pick for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote. Every Democrat voted no. Walker, 37, \u201cdoes not presently have the requisite trial or litigation experience\u201d to be a federal judge, the ABA\u2019s Standing Committee concluded in a July review. The nonpartisan ABA, which thoroughly reviews each of a president\u2019s judicial nominees, typically requires that someone chosen for a lifetime court seat have at least 12 years of experience practicing law. It\u2019s not an automatic disqualifier, though, if a nominee has other substantial trial or courtroom experience. Walker falls short on both counts. \u201cMr. Walker\u2019s experience to date has a very substantial gap, namely the absence of any significant trial experience,\u201d the ABA concluded. \u201cMr. Walker has never tried a case as lead or co-counsel, whether civil or criminal. ... In addition, based on review of his biographical information and conversations with Mr. Walker, it was challenging to determine how much of his ten years since graduation from law school has been spent in the practice of law.\u201d Ahead of the committee vote, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) chided Republicans for voting to advance Walker despite his obvious lack of qualifications \u2015 something they\u2019ve done with other Trump court picks, too. \u201cSome of the people who have come before us have literally never, ever entered a courtroom in their lives,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cThey may not have ever seen a \u201cPerry Mason\u201d show and certainly didn\u2019t stick around for the second half of any \u201cLaw and Order\u201d episode. Now they want to be trial judges for the rest of their natural lives.\u201d \u201cCome on,\u201d he added. \u201cThere have got to be more qualified Republican attorneys in America than the ones we\u2019re seeing before this committee.\u201d To date, since Trump became president, Senate Republicans have confirmed at least four lifetime federal judges who earned \u201cnot qualified\u201d ratings from the ABA. They include U.S. Circuit Judge Leonard Steven Grasz, who the ABA concluded was \u201cunable to separate his role as an advocate from that of a judge\u201d given his strong anti-LGBTQ and anti-abortion views; U.S. District Judge Charles Goodwin, who the ABA said\u00a0lacked the ability to fulfill the demands of a federal judge given his frequent absence from the courthouse in his former role as a magistrate judge; and U.S. Circuit Court Judge Jonathan Kobes, who the ABA found \u201cwas unable to provide sufficient writing samples of the caliber required\u201d of a circuit judge. For context, in his entire eight years in the White House, President Barack Obama didn\u2019t nominate anyone to be a lifetime federal judge who earned a \u201cnot qualified\u201d ABA rating. Walker, a University of Louisville law professor who previously clerked for then-D.C. Circuit Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, may be a weak candidate for a federal judgeship, but he has a strong ally in the Senate: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who recommended him to the White House. \u201cThis is unquestionably the most outstanding nomination that I\u2019ve ever recommended to Presidents to serve on the bench in Kentucky,\u201d McConnell tweeted in July, just a day after the ABA issued its awful rating of Walker\u2019s qualifications. When Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2018, Walker went out of his way to defend his former boss against credible allegations by Christine Blasey Ford\u00a0that he sexually assaulted her when they were high school students. Walker participated in more than 70 media interviews challenging Ford. \u201cShe may believe that assailant was Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d\u00a0Walker claimed in a Fox News interview in September 2018. \u201cI believe she\u2019s mistaken.\u201d Walker\u2019s nomination now heads to the full Senate for a confirmation vote.",

      "content": " President Donald Trump raged against Democrats and the House impeachment inquiry during his campaign rally Thursday in Dallas, arguing that the Democratic Party,\u00a0including 2020 presidential rival Joe Biden, had \u201cbetrayed our country.\u201d \u201cAt stake in this fight is the survival of American democracy itself. Don\u2019t kid yourself,\u201d Trump, largely going off-script, told supporters at American Airlines Arena. \u201cThey are destroying this country, but we will never let it happen, not even close. For three straight years, radical Democrats have been trying to overthrow the results of a great, great election.\u201d The president has been on the defense in recent weeks as a parade of former administration officials have spoken to House investigators, shedding new light on Trump\u2019s demands that Ukraine investigate political rival Biden and his son.\u00a0Lawmakers have fired off a slate of subpoenas to interview current and former diplomats and administration officials in recent weeks, and, despite the White House\u2019s efforts to keep them from testifying, they have been talking at length. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opened the formal impeachment inquiry last month after a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The White House released a reconstruction of the conversation, during which Trump repeatedly asked his counterpart to investigate the Bidens. Hunter Biden had served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company for five years. The call came shortly after Trump ordered his aides to put on hold nearly $400 million in military funding that had been appropriated for Ukraine, and critics have claimed the call reflected a clear demand for a quid pro quo for political help. In Texas, Trump repeated a slate of conspiracy theories featuring the Bidens, accusing the father and son of engaging in impropriety while Joe Biden was vice president. Neither has been accused of any wrongdoing, and Hunter Biden said earlier this month he did nothing \u201cimproper.\u201d But despite Trump\u2019s assertions, the drama around his call with Ukraine deepened Thursday within his own orbit as acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney held an extraordinary press conference in which he\u00a0confirmed that Trump ordered the military aid to be withheld unless Zelensky agreed to help in the U.S. election. Mulvaney\u2019s remarks to the press prompted a maelstrom within the White House and undercut Trump\u2019s own denials, but Mulvaney walked them back just hours later. He placed blame on the media for misconstruing his comments \u201cto advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump\u201d and said there was \u201cabsolutely no quid pro quo\u201d demanded by the White House. Trump echoed that in Dallas before going on a tear against Pelosi and the anonymous whistleblower, calling the House speaker \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cnuts.\u201d The criticism came a day after Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the president insulted Pelosi during a meeting at the White House, referring to her as a \u201cthird-grade politician.\u201d Pelosi fired back that Trump had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d during the discussion. \u201cI really don\u2019t believe anymore that they love our country. I don\u2019t believe it. Crazy Nancy. That crazy Nancy, she is crazy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey come after me, but what they\u2019re really doing is they\u2019re coming after the Republican Party and what they\u2019re really, really doing is they\u2019re coming after and fighting you, and we never lose.\u201d The president also demanded once again to face his whistleblower and lobbed criticism at the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, who first received the complaint and deemed it urgent and credible. \u201cWhat about the whistleblower? The whistleblower got it all wrong,\u201d Trump, appearing enraged, said. \u201cWho\u2019s the whistleblower? We have to know. Is the whistleblower the spy?\u201d",

The baseless claim is that the DNC server has gone missing in a cover-up and that Crowdstrike, a private cybersecurity company hired to investigate Russia\u2019s hack of the DNC\u2019s servers, is now framing Russia for election interference. In reality, the DNC\u2019s so-called \u201cserver\u201d is actually a system of 140 individual servers, none of which are missing.

Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, was being paid by one of the recently indicted Ukrainian-American businessmen who were helping him dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, whom Trump sees as his chief political rival. Sondland, a self-described \u201clifelong Republican\u201d who donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and was nominated as EU ambassador in 2018, told House impeachment investigators in an opening statement on Thursday that Trump indicated he was \u201cskeptical\u201d that Ukraine was serious about reform. A few days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in May, Trump instructed Sondland and others in a U.S. delegation to Ukraine to talk to Giuliani. \u201cIt was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the President\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cOur view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the President\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine.\u201d Sondland also addressed\u00a0a text message\u00a0he sent suggesting that he and a colleague\u00a0\u201cstop the back and forth by text\u201d after a colleague suggested Trump wanted a quid pro quo with Ukraine.

      "content": " Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted on Thursday that President Donald Trump withheld foreign aid in order to get Ukraine\u2019s help in the U.S. election. \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney responded when ABC News reporter Jon Karl pointed out that withholding funding from Ukraine \u201cunless the investigation into the Democrats\u2019 server happens\u201d is a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d \u201cGet over it,\u201d Mulvaney added later. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy. ... That is going to happen. Elections have consequences.\u201d Foreign policy negotiations often demand trading a move by one country with a policy change by the other. President John F. Kennedy resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis with the Soviet Union by agreeing to remove U.S. nuclear missiles from Turkey in exchange for the USSR pulling its nuclear missiles from Cuba. What makes Trump\u2019s exchange different is that the \u201cfavor\u201d he asked of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a personal, political benefit. The insertion of personal gain is what makes it corrupt. Mulvaney claimed that the Trump administration was withholding aid from Ukraine to coerce the country into investigating a supposed Democratic National Committee email server and alleged \u201ccorruption\u201d in the 2016 election \u2015 not former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump\u2019s top political rivals heading into 2020.\u00a0(Mulvaney\u2019s claim is incomplete and misleading: Trump brought up both the DNC server and Biden in his call with Ukraine\u2019s president.) When Karl asked why the U.S. stopped the aid, Mulvaney said that Trump thought it was unfair that the European Union wasn\u2019t doing more to help Ukraine. Then Mulvaney referenced a debunked conspiracy theory that claims the DNC\u2019s physical \u201cserver\u201d is missing in a cover-up and that Crowdstrike, a private cybersecurity company hired to investigate Russia\u2019s hack of the DNC\u2019s servers, is framing Russia for election interference. \u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that,\u201d Mulvaney told the reporter. \u201cBut that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we hung up the money.\u201d As The Daily Beast reported last year, the DNC\u2019s so-called \u201cserver\u201d is actually a system of 140 servers and none of the DNC\u2019s machines are missing. Speaking to reporters, Republican Sen.\u00a0Lisa Murkowski of Alaska denounced efforts to \u201chold up\u201d foreign aid for political reasons. \u201cYou don\u2019t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative,\u201d Murkowski said in response to questions about Mulvaney\u2019s press conference. Hours after the news conference, Mulvaney walked back his admission that the U.S. withheld Ukranian aid for political gain. In a lengthy statement, he said the opposite of his earlier remarks: \u201cThere was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukranian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d Mulvaney also wrongly blamed the media for \u201cmisconstruing\u201d and putting a spin on the comments he made during the news conference, which was televised and streamed live to the public. Paul Blumenthal contributed reporting. This article has been updated with Mulvaney\u2019s later comments denying he had said there was a quid pro quo over political help.",

Cummings died at Gilchrist Hospice Care in Baltimore at approximately 2:30 a.m. Thursday \u201cdue to complications concerning longstanding health challenges,\u201d his office confirmed in a statement to HuffPost. He did not return to work following an unidentified medical procedure in September. \u201cCongressman Cummings was an honorable man who proudly served his district and the nation with dignity, integrity, compassion and humility,\u201d his wife Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, the Maryland Democratic Party chair, said in a statement. \u201cHe worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation\u2019s diversity was our promise, not our problem,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to walk by his side on this incredible journey. I loved him deeply and will miss him dearly.\u201d Cummings, the son of a sharecropper, practiced law for almost two decades and served in the Maryland House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in 1996, where he was renowned for championing civil rights issues. His House committee\u2019s probes into the Trump administration drew fierce anger from the president. In July, Trump tweeted racist insults about Cummings and his majority-black district, calling it a \u201crodent-infested mess.\u201d Cummings earlier this year said he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Trump is a racist after the president said four Democratic members of Congress \u2015 all women of color \u2015 should \u201cgo back\u201d to other countries. On the only time in 2017 that Cummings talked one-on-one with Trump about lowering drug prices, the Baltimore Sun reported him as telling the president: \u201cMr. President. You\u2019re now 70-something, I\u2019m 60-something. Very soon you and I will be dancing with the angels.

      "author": "Antonia Blumberg",
      "content": " President Donald Trump plans to host next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit for leaders of major industrial nations at his golf resort in Miami, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announced on Thursday. Mulvaney told reporters during a press briefing that the Trump National Doral is the \u201cbest place\u201d to host the summit, dismissing concerns that the president would personally profit by doing so. \u201cThere\u2019s no issue on him profiting on this in any way, shape or form,\u201d Mulvaney said. Mulvaney said the administration looked at 12 potential sites before settling on the Doral. \u201cThis was by far and away the best choice,\u201d he said. The acting chief of staff dismissed one reporter\u2019s comparison of Trump to former Vice President Joe Biden, saying the Trump family made its money before Trump was in office. (The president is facing a House impeachment investigation for pressuring the government of Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden for allegedly using his office to personally profit.) Mulvaney said Trump is aware that hosting the summit at his own property could raise concerns of impropriety. \u201cThe president knows that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the environment we live in. He knows exactly he\u2019s going to get that reaction. That\u2019s fine, I\u2019m willing to take that.\u201d House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) called the administration\u2019s decision \u201cbrazen\u201d and accused the president of using his office \u201cfor personal financial gain\u201d\u00a0in a statement on Thursday. \u201cThe Administration\u2019s announcement that President Trump\u2019s Doral Miami resort will be the site of the next G7 summit is among the most brazen examples yet of the President\u2019s corruption,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cHe is exploiting his office and making official U.S. government decisions for his personal financial gain.\u201d Trump first floated the idea of hosting the G-7 summit at his Florida resort in August, prompting the House Judiciary Committee to look into potential violations of the U.S. Constitution. The president is the sole beneficiary of a trust that now owns his family business. Hosting the summit at the Doral would thus likely put many millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s own cash registers. In a financial disclosure form filed in May, the president claimed to have received $81,417,193 in \u201cincome\u201d from the Florida resort over the previous year. Trump\u2019s use of his own property for the summit could prove to violate the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, which prohibit federal officeholders from receiving gifts or payments from governments, Nadler and Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), who chairs the subcommittee on the Constitution, civil rights and civil liberties, said in a statement in August. Nadler said Thursday that the committee would continue investigating the decision for possible violations of the emoluments clauses. But he added: \u201cWe will not allow this latest abuse of power to distract from Congress\u2019 efforts to get to the bottom of the President\u2019s interference in the 2020 election.\u201d Mulvaney\u2019s assertion that the Trump resort is obviously the \u201cbest choice\u201d for the summit has also been called into question. \u201cIt\u2019s a dump,\u201d one former White House official, who asked not to be named, said of the Doral. During the Republican National Committee\u2019s meeting at the resort last spring, there were major maintenance issues in evidence. \u201cAt least one of the guest buildings smelled of mildew, as did its guest rooms,\u201d HuffPost\u2019s S.V.\u00a0Date\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier this year. \u201cThe restaurant on the lower floor in the main lodge had a mustiness tinged with the fraternity house odor of spilled alcohol. Its lap pool\u2019s water was both over-chlorinated and kept at too low a level, making it unpleasant to use for its intended purpose.\u201d This story has been updated with a statement from House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler.

Trump has \u201cbought himself an enormous headache now\u201d with his choice for next year\u2019s summit, Napolitano explained Thursday on Fox Business. \u201cThis is about as direct and profound a violation of the emoluments clause as one could create.\u201d The emoluments clause of the Constitution prohibits federal officeholders from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments. It\u2019s designed to prevent the president from being influenced by gifts or cash from foreign entities.\u00a0The Doral setup is \u201cexactly what the emoluments clause was written to prohibit,\u201d Napolitano said.

Critics point out that the business also will greatly benefit financially from the worldwide exposure such an event would bring.

Perry told the president before his campaign rally in Dallas. \u201cIt has been a tremendous honor to serve our country in your administration in such a meaningful way,\u201d Perry said in a letter to Trump. He did not give a specific date when he would leave office, noting that he plans \u201cto resign at a date later this year.\u201d The Department of Energy made Perry\u2019s resignation letter public on Thursday night, just as Trump announced it during his rally in Dallas. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be leaving at the end of the year, and probably coming back here,\u201d Trump told his Texas supporters. Whatever he does he\u2019s going to be very successful.\u201d Perry\u2019s notice of resignation comes after weeks of speculation over his departure and before news of his involvement with Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals came to light. Perry, the former governor of Texas, revealed in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that he called Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, under Trump\u2019s direction, to discuss the president\u2019s concerns of corruption in Ukraine. Perry told the Journal that the call was intended to help set up a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The remarks Perry made in that interview directly contradicts an earlier report by Axios that Trump during a conference call claimed he unwillingly made the call to Zelensky, which is now the focus of a House impeachment probe because Perry urged him to. Though Perry didn\u2019t offer an official date for his departure, he was reportedly expected to leave office by the end of November, Politico reported earlier this month. Earlier Thursday, at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new Luis Vuitton factory in Texas, Trump told reporters that he already had a replacement lined up for energy secretary. \u201cWe have the man ... that we\u2019re going to be putting in Rick\u2019s place,\u201d Trump said, according to video by The Hill. Perry has served as energy secretary for over two years. This article has been updated with the Department of Energy making a formal announcement of Perry\u2019s resignation.",

In his\u00a0opening statement, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union said he only recently learned that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani may have tried to get Ukrainian officials to probe the former vice president\u2019s dealings in the country. But it would have been almost impossible for someone working at the highest levels of diplomacy, who claimed Ukraine was an important part of his portfolio,\u00a0to ignore the signs \u2015 or the headlines. Even before Trump\u2019s now-infamous\u00a0July 25 phone call\u00a0in which he requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky launch an investigation into Biden, there was a deluge of press coverage about his son Hunter Biden\u2019s work at gas company Burisma Holdings, and Trump\u2019s interest in it. If that weren\u2019t enough, Giuliani and other Trump associates had spent months openly pushing conspiracy theories involving Biden and Ukraine. In Sondland\u2019s account of events, Trump held a meeting with him, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and then-special representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker on May 23 in which it became clear that Giuliani would be the president\u2019s point person on Ukraine. \u201cI did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign,\u201d Sondland stated. But it shouldn\u2019t have been hard for Sondland to guess Trump and Giuliani\u2019s interest in Ukraine: Giuliani\u00a0openly told The New York Times\u00a0on May 9 that he was traveling to Kyiv to push for an investigation into Biden and Burisma. Giuliani was then forced to cancel his trip amid a public backlash and allegations he was seeking to influence the 2020 election. He blamed the cancellation on \u201cenemies of the president\u201d he\u00a0claimed\u00a0were in the current Ukrainian administration. Days before Giuliani canceled his trip, it was also\u00a0front-page news in The New York Times\u00a0that Trump and his associates were focused on the Bidens\u2019 history in Ukraine as they looked at Joe Biden as a potential opponent in 2020. The May 2 report specifically highlighted Giuliani\u2019s role in the effort, pointing out that he had met with both current and former top prosecutors in Ukraine to ask about the Burisma investigation. \u201cMr. Giuliani has spearheaded the effort among conservatives to publicize and encourage the new investigation in Ukraine,\u201d the Times reported. Allegations that Biden had sought to quash an investigation into Burisma had been swirling around conservative media for months after John Solomon, an opinion columnist for The Hill, promoted a series of\u00a0dubious and poorly fact-checked claims\u00a0from a former Ukrainian prosecutor. His piece on Biden was shared over 37,000 times and prompted far-right outlets such as The Gateway Pundit to run with the story in multiple follow-up articles. Solomon, now a contributor for Fox News, was also a frequent guest of Trump favorites on the network such as Sean Hannity. Trump even tweeted out, \u201cJohn Solomon: As Russia Collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges,\u201d following one of Hannity\u2019s shows in March \u2014 the title of a column claiming a conspiracy between Democrats and Ukrainian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign. The scrutiny of the Bidens in Ukraine and Giuliani\u2019s role in pushing for an investigation intensified in the months after The New York Times story, with\u00a0The Washington Post,\u00a0The New Yorker, The Washington Times,\u00a0BuzzFeed\u00a0and others all publishing substantial reports on the subject. Beyond the media coverage, Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters and advisers had made Biden and Ukraine a frequent talking point. Trump 2020 communications director\u00a0Tim Murtaugh, senior adviser\u00a0Katrina Pierson\u00a0and rapid response director\u00a0Andrew Clark\u00a0all tweeted about the accusations against Biden, as did various other conservative figures and far-right activists. Despite the wealth of information on Ukraine, the Bidens, and Guiliani\u2019s rabid pursuit of conspiracy theories related to them, Sondland supposedly missed this entire part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts.\u00a0He even told Congress that although Giuliani directly mentioned Burisma to him in August, the company\u2019s name didn\u2019t stand out as worth noticing. His carefully worded statement also neglected to mention exactly when he finally did come to understand that Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine included pushing for an investigation. If you believe his account, it\u2019s a wonder he ever learned about it at all.",

In a letter dated Thursday, Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.) called the decision \u201canother outrageous example of the President using his office to funnel money from American taxpayers and foreign sources into his own pockets.\u201d The Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses forbid any president from profiting off his or her role in the Oval Office. Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney revealed Trump National Doral would host the next G-7 summit of top world leaders at an extraordinary press conference Thursday afternoon. \u201cThis was by far and away the best choice,\u201d Mulvaney said, claiming that officials considered 12 potential sites before settling on Doral. He also claimed Trump would not profit from the decision to hold the global conference at his own commercial property. In their letter \u2015 addressed to Mulvaney, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan (who submitted his resignation last week), Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2015 the senators demanded to know when Trump first suggested the summit be held at his Miami resort. He first made the suggestion publicly in late August. The senators are demanding to see a wide swath of documentation, including texts, emails and meeting notes, a list of precisely which other sites were considered and those properties\u2019 bids, and projected costs of hosting the summit at Doral. Multiple past White House ethics chiefs \u2015 along with Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano \u2015 have slammed the decision as a clear violation of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses. Other critics say Trump may have violated the constitutional ban on accepting outside payments on multiple occasions already, having made frequent visits to his golf properties in Virginia and Florida since his inauguration. The White House, for its part, says these visits are billed \u201cat cost\u201d so the Trump Organization derives no profit from taxpayer dollars. But the president sparked even more questions when Vice President Mike Pence stayed at Trump International in Doonbeg, Ireland, over the summer, even though his meetings with Irish leaders were on the other side of the country, in Dublin. Pence\u2019s trip is currently under investigation by multiple congressional committees, who are also looking into the Air Force\u2019s use of Trump Turnberry \u2015 a golf resort located near an airport the military uses for refueling in Scotland.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 The announcement that next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit for leaders of major industrial nations will be held at President Donald Trump\u2019s golf resort in Miami was met with apathy from many members of his party on Capitol Hill on Thursday, even as Democrats and ethics watchdogs cried foul that holding the event at a business the president personally profits from would put him in direct violation of the Constitution. \u201cShow me where there is a violation of law. I\u2019m not sure that there is, not that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) told reporters on Thursday. The emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits federal government officials from accepting gifts from foreign states. Democrats have argued in court that the president is violating the emoluments clause by accepting payments from foreign and domestic parties through his businesses, like the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. \u201cIt\u2019s so brazen and craven that it\u2019s virtually saying, \u2018To heck with the rule of law,\u2019\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). The senator said he planned to add the matter to his lawsuit against Trump focusing on his business deals and the emoluments clause. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters during a press briefing on Thursday that the Trump National Doral is the \u201cbest place\u201d to host the summit, dismissing concerns that the president would personally profit by doing so. \u201cThis was by far and away the best choice,\u201d Mulvaney claimed, noting the administration considered other options for the event. But Blumenthal argued that the issue of whether Trump profits from the move or does not is irrelevant given that the emoluments clause does not specifically mention \u201cprofit,\u201d and because of the president\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns. \u201cThe question is not profit. It\u2019s money and payments. And we\u2019ll never know whether there is profit because it\u2019s not a public corporation and he\u2019s not releasing his tax returns,\u201d he added. Few Republicans spoke out against the White House decision to host the G-7 at Trump Doral on Thursday. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said \u201cno\u201d when asked if she found it appropriate. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said the president\u2019s resort was \u201cprobably not the best location\u201d for the summit. Other Republicans downplayed the decision, however, putting faith in Trump even as the House moved forward with its impeachment inquiry. \u201cIt may seem careless politically, but on the other hand there\u2019s tremendous integrity in his boldness and his transparency,\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said of Trump, complaining that Democrats \u201cmake big deals out of nothing all the time.\u201d \u201cI would have a problem if they were paying double the going rate, if it was a one-star resort getting four-star rates or five-star rates,\u201d\u00a0Cramer added of the summit, which is typically financed with taxpayer dollars. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), meanwhile, said he would be hard-pressed to oppose an event that would bring a substantial financial boon to residents of his home state of Florida, even as he allowed some might quibble with its legality. \u201cAnything that draws a major event like that to Florida is not something I would discourage,\u201d Rubio said of the G-7\u2019s planned location in Miami. Asked whether Trump\u2019s profiting from the G-7 would blunt the president\u2019s attacks against former Vice President Joe Biden, who he has accused of enriching his family while in office, Rubio shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t think it changes anything. I just think it\u2019s another day in the life of Washington, D.C., these days,\u201d he said.",

      "content": " House Democrats have threatened to subpoena the General Services Administration if the agency does not hand over records related to the approval of President Donald Trump\u2019s Washington, D.C., hotel by next Wednesday. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has repeatedly requested documents related to the GSA\u2019s approval of the hotel, which occupies space in a federal building owned by the agency. The GSA has sent over some documents, but withheld others, including the legal memos and the hotel\u2019s monthly profit reports and profit statements. Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) and Rep. Dina Titus (D-Nev.), chair of the subcommittee in charge of public buildings, requested those withheld documents be handed over by Oct. 23 in a letter sent to GSA Administrator Emily Murphy\u00a0on Thursday. If the agency fails to produce those documents the committee will compel them by issuing a subpoena. The committee\u2019s pursuit of these documents is part of its investigation into the president\u2019s conflicts of interest, his potential violations of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, which bar him from receiving payments or benefits from governments beyond his salary, and whether GSA followed proper procedures in approving the lease for the hotel. The Trump Organization was awarded a lease to build a luxury hotel inside the historic Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue in 2014. The Trump International Hotel opened in October 2016, just weeks before Trump would win the presidential election. His victory posed a sudden problem for the new hotel. The lease contained a clause forbidding any \u201celected official of the Government of the United States\u201d to \u201cbe admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.\u201d Additionally, the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses forbid executive branch officers from receiving any payment or benefit from foreign governments and both federal and state governments aside from their salary. GSA lawyers could have investigated this issue during the 2016 election, but they didn\u2019t. Instead, they waited until after Trump won the election to begin considering the problems posed by his continued ownership of the lease, according to an inspector general report. GSA lawyers then decided they would completely ignore the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses in their review of legal problems posed by the president owning a federal lease. The hotel has since become a symbol of the Trump administration\u2019s corruption. It has attracted lobbyists, foreign governments, corporate executives and Republican political campaigns to spend lavishly. And the president personally benefits from all payments to the hotel. Read the letter to the GSA below: This story has been updated with more background on the hotel.",

      "content": "DALLAS \u2015 President Donald Trump said Thursday that he had to let Kurdish allies and Turkey \u201cfight a little while\u201d before the U.S. would be able to stop the Turkish attack on northern Syria that the president himself had enabled. \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight a little while, then people find out how tough the fighting is,\u201d he told supporters at his campaign rally in Dallas. \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight like two kids in a lot, you gotta let them fight, and then you pull them apart.\u201d Earlier Thursday, the White House said Turkey agreed to temporarily halt deadly military operations against northern Syria, a region that\u2019s been held by Kurdish allies who had been fighting ISIS alongside the U.S. troops until Trump decided to abruptly withdraw earlier this month. The agreement gives the Kurds some time to give up their weapons and leave the region that Turkey has been trying to capture. It will allow Turkish forces to take over northern Syria. The deal worked \u201cwithout spilling a drop of American blood,\u201d Trump told supporters at the rally. The withdrawal decision led to Turkey attacking the Kurdish-held region with at least 180 airstrikes as of Thursday morning, killing at least 16 fighters, four civilians (including an infant), and injuring at least 70 more in border towns, according to The New York Times.\u00a0Hundreds of thousands of Kurds have fled northeastern Syria since Trump\u2019s announcement to withdraw the U.S. troops. The deal, which Turkey\u2019s foreign minister clarified as a \u201cpause\u201d and not a ceasefire, creates a five-day halt in Turkey\u2019s attack against the Kurds, whom the country considers terrorists. The deal came after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Turkey to prevent an escalation of the violence that Trump had effectively greenlighted. \u201cDuring a five-day period, we\u2019re going to see if we can get it all finalized, and I think it will be,\u201d Trump said Thursday evening. \u201cSo Turkey\u2019s going to be happy, the Kurds are going to be happy, ISIS is going to be unhappy.\u201d Trump sympathized with Turkey at the campaign rally, calling the country\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan a \u201cgentleman\u201d and saying that Turkey \u201cwas having a lot of bad things happen from this region, in all fairness.\u201d The president has faced overwhelming backlash by both Democrats and Republicans for his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the Kurdish-held region, basically allowing Turkish forces to invade while leaving the Kurds vulnerable. Many said the decision would likely lead to a resurgence of ISIS, made more likely after hundreds of ISIS supporters escaped detention in northern Syria as a result of Trump\u2019s move. On Wednesday, Trump made a series of comments undermining the U.S. alliance with the Kurds, saying the fighters were \u201cnot angels\u201d and the Turkish invasion \u201cnot our problem.\u201d The Senate on Thursday introduced sanctions on Turkey, a more detailed and punitive measure than the sanctions Trump imposed earlier this week. The House voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to condemn Trump\u2019s recent foreign policy decision in the Middle East. Trump has continued to defend his decision, saying this week that it was \u201cstrategically brilliant.\u201d On Wednesday, after the House vote, the president berated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a meeting meant to be about Trump\u2019s plan of action on Syria. Some supporters at the rally thought Trump made the right move in pulling the U.S. troops from the region, citing the need for the country to stay out of wars. \u201cWe need to get out of there. We\u2019ve been having wars for no reason for pretty much my entire life,\u201d 40-year-old Josh Warren of Garland, Texas, told HuffPost. \u201c[President George W.] Bush put us in those wars. They were wars to fill his pockets. Bush wasn\u2019t really for this country.\u201d \u201cI think he needs to bring our American troops home,\u201d said Debbie Bewley. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to be involved in useless wars.\u201d",

A sea of red hats and shirts calling for \u201cliberal tears\u201d and \u201cTrump 2020: No more bullshit\u201d flooded downtown Dallas ahead of the rally.

In the speech, Trump hurled insults against leading liberal figures like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (\u201ccrazy\u201d), former Vice President Joe Biden (\u201csleepy\u201d), former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas (\u201cvery dumb\u201d) and elected Democrats in general (\u201cvery sick\u201d). Biden and O\u2019Rourke are among Trump\u2019s 2020 rivals. \u201cThey want to impose an extreme agenda,\u201d Trump said of the Democrats. \u201cThey cannot pass it and they cannot win it at the ballot box.

They know it \u2015 they\u2019re not going to win it\u2026 It\u2019s going to be a landslide.\u201d But behind Trump\u2019s show of force lies lackluster polling numbers, a weakening Republican Party and uncertainty about whether the president is more of an asset or a liability for the conservative control of the country\u2019s largest red state. Dallas itself is a Democratic stronghold, so Trump\u2019s visit offered a moment for the president to connect with supporters in the surrounding suburbs and rural areas, where he remains popular. But Democrats are gaining on Republicans across Texas. They sharply narrowed the statewide gap in last year\u2019s midterm election, led by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s near-miss Senate campaign. Republicans\u2019 margin of victory in that statewide race was not the double-digit thumping they\u2019re used to here. Sen. Ted Cruz held on to his seat in a less-than-3-percentage-point squeaker, and the power of the far-right dwindled in the Statehouse. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign hinged on the use of Trump as a foil. \u201cTrump is without question the worst thing that has happened to the Texas Republican Party in the last 20 years,\u201d Rice University political scientist Mark Jones said. \u201cHe single-handedly turned Texas from a red state to a pink state.\u201d Some Texas Republicans have echoed that theory behind closed doors. \u201cWith all due respect to Trump, who I love, by the way, he\u2019s killing us in the urban-suburban districts,\u201d Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen said in a private meeting in June, according to secretly recorded audio released this week. \u201cThe only reason Donald Trump is in Texas tonight is that he knows he will lose the state and lose this election,\u201d Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement. \u201cSeveral polls show Trump losing Texas to top Democratic contenders. Donald Trump is terrified.\u201d Trump carried Texas in 2016 by 9 percentage points. But 48% of Texas voters said they definitely wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2020, according to a Quinnipiac poll released last month, compared with 35% who said they\u2019d definitely support him. Other surveys have shown leading Democrats within the margin of error in head-to-head matches with Trump. Texas leaders who joined Trump, however, offered full-throated support and cast aside concerns that the state could flip as an invention of the media. \u201cIf they take Texas, they will take the U.S. Senate. If they take Texas, they will take the White House. But we can\u2019t let that happen \u2015 not on our watch,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn said at the rally. \u201cWe know the liberals who are running against President Trump want open borders, socialized medicine. They want to bankrupt Texas with the Green New Deal.\u201d Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick urged the crowd to boo O\u2019Rourke repeatedly and excoriated the \u201cprogressive left\u201d as \u201cour enemy.\u201d Patrick bragged that the president would draw more people to the portable toilets at his rally than O\u2019Rourke would draw at the counter-rally in nearby Grand Prairie. Thursday\u2019s rally marked Trump\u2019s second major political event this year. He also held a major rally in El Paso back in February aimed at drumming up support for his proposed border wall and to take jabs at O\u2019Rourke after his Senate run. He also visited in April for fundraising.",

Smith memorial dinner Thursday night, capitalizing on the annual opportunity to banter about politics at the white-tie charity affair. In the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s remarks during an explosive meeting Wednesday with congressional leaders\u00a0about the situation in Syria, in which Trump dubbed Mattis \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general,\u201d Mattis claimed the title with pride. \u201cI\u2019m not just an overrated general, I am the greatest, the world\u2019s most, overrated,\u201d Mattis quipped. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be considered that by Donald Trump, because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress. So I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals. And frankly, that sounds pretty good to me.\u201d Mattis continued to unleash the one-liners throughout his speech, roasting the president again later, saying:\u00a0\u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield; Donald Trump earned his spurs from the doctor\u201d \u2015 in a brazen reference to Trump\u2019s deferral from service in the Vietnam War due to a medical disqualification for \u201cbone spurs\u201d in his feet. The president gave Mattis his new \u201coverrated\u201d title in response to a question from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who read a quote from Mattis\u2019 Sunday appearance on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d warning that ISIS would resurge in the Middle East if the U.S. withdrew from northern Syria. According to two Democratic aides present at the meeting, the president cut Schumer\u2019s question short, writing Mattis off as the \u201cworld\u2019s most overrated general.\u201d \u201cYou know why? He wasn\u2019t tough enough,\u201d Trump said, according to the aides. \u201cI captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.\u201d Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, was Trump\u2019s first defense secretary. He resigned in 2018 because, he said, his views on policy did not align with those of the president. Trump called Oscar winner Streep one of the \u201cmost over-rated actresses in Hollywood\u201d in 2017 after she criticized him during her speech after winning an award at the Golden Globes. \u201cYou do have to admit that, between me and Meryl, at least we\u2019ve had some victories,\u201d Mattis quipped Thursday.",

      "author": "Arthur Delaney",
      "content": " Nearly a million kids could lose automatic access to free school lunches thanks to a policy change the Donald Trump administration could finalize next year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture released the number this week after having initially said the rule change would affect far fewer children. In the past year, the administration has proposed a series of new regulations that would reduce enrollment and cut benefits in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The proposed cuts are a core part of the administration\u2019s anti-welfare agenda, which has hummed along in the background as the president\u2019s scandals and corruption dominate headlines. One proposal would reduce states\u2019 flexibility in setting eligibility standards, potentially trimming caseloads by 3 million, or about 9% of total projected enrollment in 2020. The National School Lunch Program serves more than 30 million kids, including 22 million who qualify for free or reduced-price meals if their parents have low incomes. A subset of those students are automatically certified for free meals if their parents receive SNAP benefits; it\u2019s those kids who could lose automatic enrollment in free or discounted school lunches under the Trump proposal. The vast majority of students who would lose automatic certification would still be eligible for free or reduced meals, but they would have to apply instead of being automatically signed up when their school crosschecks federal SNAP enrollment data. The USDA said only 4% of the affected kids would lose eligibility for free or discounted lunch, but has acknowledged that some of those who are eligible will not go through the application process. Democrats are not impressed. \u201cEven for those who remain eligible, forcing low-income families to navigate the burdensome paperwork will inevitably lead to eligible children losing access to a critical source of daily nutrition,\u201d said Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.). When the Trump administration originally released the rule in July, USDA officials told reporters the proposal would affect 265,000 schoolchildren. This week, the USDA said in a regulatory filing that closer to 982,000 kids would be affected. \u201cThe analysis more than doubles the figures USDA first estimated, and now shows almost a million students will either lose their free school meals entirely, or have to jump through additional bureaucratic hoops to re-certify their eligibility,\u201d Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) said in a press release. At a hearing on Thursday, USDA official Brandon Lipps suggested that the administration had to cut benefits because too many undeserving people are gaming the system. \u201cFor far too long, negative press has weakened Americans\u2019 confidence in important programs you have charged us with administering,\u201d Lipps said, pointing to the tale of a millionaire who\u2019d signed up for benefits in Minnesota just to make a point about lax eligibility standards. (The man qualified because he had no income.) Republicans themselves have made a strong effort to generate negative press about food benefits and to publicize the case of the wealthy retiree known as the \u201cMinnesota Millionaire.\u201d They\u00a0invited him to a hearing in June, cited his story when they put out the regulation in July, and did so again this week. Republicans in the Minnesota legislature trumpeted his case in 2018. \u201cBecause one person scammed the system we\u2019re supposed to punish hungry kids?\u201d Fudge asked. \u201cIt is just ridiculous and I\u2019m sick of hearing it.\u201d",

The events have\u00a0\u201cset back the United States\u2019 campaign against the Islamic State and other terrorists. Unless halted, our retreat will invite the brutal Assad regime in Syria and its Iranian backers to expand their influence.\u201d McConnell also noted that \u201cwe are ignoring Russia\u2019s efforts to leverage its increasingly dominant position in Syria to amass power and influence throughout the Middle East and beyond. ... Predictably, our adversaries seem to be relishing these developments.\u201d The Kentucky senator pointed to his experience working with three presidential administrations since the Sept. 11 terror attacks and learning that the threat from groups like the self-described Islamic State, also known as ISIS, \u201cis real and cannot be wished away,\u201d he warned. He pointed out that the U.S. is \u201cnot in this fight alone,\u201d and has relied on local forces, including the Kurds, in the fight against ISIS. \u201cIronically, Syria had been a model for this increasingly successful approach,\u201d McConnell noted. \u201cWe saw humanitarian disaster and a terrorist free-for-all after we abandoned Afghanistan in the 1990s, laying the groundwork for 9/11,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cWe will see these things anew in Syria and Afghanistan if we abandon our partners and retreat from these conflicts before they are won.\u201d Earlier this month, Trump agreed to cede the battlefield in northeast Syria to Turkey, which began attacking Kurdish residents of the region almost immediately.

      "content": " An assistant to Rick Perry said Friday that the outgoing Energy Secretary won\u2019t comply with a subpoena from the House of Representatives as part of its impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. In a letter to the three House Democrats who issued the subpoena last week,\u00a0Assistant Secretary of Energy Melissa Burnison said the Energy Department is \u201cunable to comply with your request for documents and communications at this time\u201d and argued that items requested \u201care potentially protected by executive privilege\u201d and thus require careful review before they can be shared. \u201cGiven that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to participate in it,\u201d the letter said. The documents Perry is refusing to provide concern the issue at the heart of the House\u2019s impeachment probe:\u00a0the Trump administration\u2019s communications with Ukraine, and Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the president\u2019s political rivals. The former Texas governor\u2019s entanglements in Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal came to the surface earlier this month when sources familiar with the situation told Axios that during a recent conference call with House Republicans, Trump said Perry had arranged his July 25 call with Zelensky. Perry also told The Wall Street Journal this week that Trump directed him to communicate with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani about alleged corruption in Ukraine, showing how closely Perry is connected to Trump\u2019s dealings with the foreign power. Perry\u2019s response to the subpoena comes a day after he announced his plans to resign by the end of the year, saying he wants to spend more time\u00a0in Texas with family.",
