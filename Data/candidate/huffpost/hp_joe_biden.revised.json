      "content": " There\u2019s bad news for those who were hoping the events involving President Donald Trump\u00a0on Wednesday were part of a wrinkle in time. They were very much real. Following a dramatic day of foul-mouthed tweeting, raging at reporters and\u00a0awkward moments with visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, Trump found time to drop a doctored version of Nickelback\u2019s \u201cLook At This Photograph\u201d music video, which had been edited to include an image of Joe Biden and his son alongside two other men. The video was later flagged and removed from Twitter for copyright infringement. Trump\u2019s tweet, minus the video, remained online as of early Thursday. The video takes a swing at Biden for saying he never spoke with his son about his business dealings in Ukraine and follows up with an image of the father and son golfing with a man labelled as a \u201cUkraine Gas Exec.\u201d The gas exec is Devon Archer, Hunter Biden\u2019s longtime American business partner. The two were both board members of Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings. The president posted the video in response to the intensifying impeachment inquiry\u00a0that began last week. A whistleblower complaint regarding his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed that Trump asked Zelensky as a \u201cfavor\u201d to investigate his 2020 rival and son based on unfounded corruption allegations relating to Burisma Holdings. Trump has\u00a0accused Biden\u00a0of seeking the removal of a prosecutor in Ukraine when he was Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, supposedly in an attempt to quash an investigation into Burisma Holdings.\u00a0Trump\u2019s accusation was widely considered to be unfounded; numerous Ukrainian officials and independent media reports\u00a0said there was no evidence Biden advocated for the prosecutor\u2019s removal with his son\u2019s interests in mind. Prior to posting the Nickelback tweet, Trump gave a press conference where he grew agitated while repeatedly\u00a0refusing to answer a reporter\u2019s question about what exactly he wanted to be investigated. People on social media were surprised by the Nickelback tweet for an array of reasons:",

      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign is asking television news executives to stop booking attorney Rudy Giuliani, who is spreading \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of\u201d his client,\u00a0President Donald Trump. The request came in a letter that top aides Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield sent to anchors, producers and senior leadership at ABC, CNN, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and Fox News. \u201cWhile you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough,\u201d a copy of the memo obtained by HuffPost read. \u201cBy giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\u201d Continuing, the campaign slammed Giuliani as a Trump surrogate who \u201chas demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative.\u201d \u201cGiuliani is not enlightening your viewers in any way. He\u2019s not offering a unique or informed perspective. He\u2019s certainly not introducing new facts, since his relationship with the truth is casual at best.\u201d The message follows revelations that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to assist Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr with a probe of Biden and his son, based on unfounded corruption allegations. The conversation has fueled an impeachment inquiry into the president, who has been accused of soliciting election help from a foreign government. During the elder Biden\u2019s vice presidency, Hunter Biden worked on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukraine-based energy firm from which he made up to\u00a0$50,000 per month,\u00a0according to The New York Times. At the time, Joe Biden was pushing \u2015 along with the international community \u2015 for the ouster of the country\u2019s then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who was leading a corruption probe of Burisma. However, there remains no evidence that Joe Biden was aware of the investigation. Furthermore, in May, Yuriy Lutsenko, one of Shokin\u2019s successors who has since left the position,\u00a0told Bloomberg News,\u00a0\u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2015 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.\u201d In spite of that, Giuliani has made television appearances as recently as Sunday to promulgate his theory and gin up suspicion over the Democratic presidential candidate. He has also claimed that Ukraine, rather than Russia, was responsible for the 2016 hack into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s server. U.S. intelligence agencies have already determined that it was indeed Russia that perpetrated the breach. The latter allegation prompted Trump\u2019s own former homeland security adviser and current ABC News analyst Tom Bossert to speak out against Giuliani on air Sunday, stating the claim has \u201cno validity.\u201d \u201cAt this point I am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing in repeating that debunked theory to the president,\u201d Bossert said. Now, Biden\u2019s campaign is urging news outlets to cut Giuliani off, warning that he is pushing \u201coutlandish falsehoods and disinformation in the knowledge that it is hard for the corrections to catch up.\u201d \u201cYour obligation is to provide the American people with an informed, fact-based and responsible coverage and debate of critical issues.\u201d In a statement to The Daily Beast, which broke the story, Giuliani said the letter \u201csounds like the usual left wing censorship,\u201d arguing that \u201ceverything\u201d he says is backed up by \u201caffidavits and statements\u201d and that the left is engaged in a cover-up. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign manager, Brad Parscale, also weighed in on Twitter, asking whether the same request could be made of news organizations regarding the booking of Democrats, accusing the left of pushing \u201choaxes.\u201d",

      "author": "Marina Fang",
      "content": " President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested China should investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden, appearing to openly ask another foreign government to influence an American election, even as Congress investigates him for allegedly pressuring Ukraine into doing the same thing. \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters Thursday. The president made the suggestion while defending himself against House Democrats\u2019 impeachment proceedings, launched after Trump appeared to pressure Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden, whose son Hunter has had business dealings in the country. Trump on Thursday continued to openly call for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\u00a0He\u00a0first made the request in a July 25 call\u00a0that became public after an anonymous whistleblower filed a complaint, which is now the centerpiece of the House impeachment inquiry. \u201cIf they were honest about it, they\u2019d start a major investigation into the Bidens. It\u2019s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d Trump\u2019s suggestion comes amid GOP scrutiny at Hunter Biden joining the board of a Chinese private equity fund in 2013, while his father was vice president. The younger Biden accompanied the then-vice president on an official trip to China during that time. In response to the latest comments, Biden and his campaign said in a Thursday statement it was yet another example of Trump\u2019s \u201congoing abuse of power.\u201d \u201cWhat Donald Trump just said on the South Lawn of the White House was this election\u2019s equivalent of his infamous \u2018Russia, if you\u2019re listening\u2019 moment from 2016 \u2014 a grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country,\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign said, referencing Trump asking Russia to investigate 2016 presidential opponent Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. \u201cThe White House itself has admitted that Donald Trump tried to bully a foreign country into lying about the domestic opponent he\u2019s afraid to look in the eye next November.\u201d Trump\u2019s angry defense against the impeachment proceedings has included trying to portray these unprecedented requests for foreign intervention in U.S. elections as routine. The president has previously defended the call \u2014 in which, according to the White House\u2019s summary, he dangled military aid in exchange for the investigation into his political rival \u2014 as \u201ca perfect conversation.\u201d \u201cNot a thing wrong,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cHow can you impeach somebody on that conversation?\u201d While defending himself, Trump has also falsely accused both the whistleblower and House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), leading the investigation into Trump\u2019s call, of \u201ctreason.\u201d During a contentious press conference Wednesday, in which he appeared belligerent and red-faced, Trump repeatedly badgered Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason, when Mason tried to ask exactly what Trump wanted from Zelensky. While calling Mason \u201crude\u201d and criticizing \u201cthe corrupt media,\u201d Trump continued to defend the call and claimed that \u201cBiden and his son are stone-cold crooked.\u201d",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden would seek legislation requiring owners of assault weapons to either sell their guns or register them with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, his campaign said Wednesday ahead of a major gun violence policy forum. Biden\u2019s proposal does not go as far as some of his Democratic rivals. Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke has pushed for a mandatory buyback of all assault weapons, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have both argued for a federal gun licensing system. Biden and other leading Democratic 2020 presidential contenders are set to speak at a forum in Las Vegas sponsored by the gun control groups Giffords and March For Our Lives. The forum is scheduled two years and one day after the deadliest mass shooting in American history, which killed 58 people at a country music festival in the city. Biden\u2019s plan, which would need to pass a potentially divided Congress, would offer a voluntary buyback program for assault weapons. Gun owners who don\u2019t want to sell their weapons could register them with the ATF under the National Firearms Act. Owners are already required to register machine guns and short-barreled rifles under the law, which the Biden campaign says limits how frequently the weapons are used in criminal activity. \u201cThe way the vice president approaches this is \u2018first things first,\u2019\u201d a Biden adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters. \u201cWe have a comprehensive plan to deal with the problem of assault weapons.\u201d Biden would also push for universal background checks for gun purchasers, legislation barring all online gun and ammunition sales, incentives for states to enact red flag laws and gun licensing programs, limits on gun purchases to one per individual per month, and laws to make adults criminally liable for negligently giving a minor access to a firearm and to require gun owners to safely store their weapons. Biden has a long history on gun violence. He was chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee when the existing background check system passed in 1993, and when the assault weapons ban (no longer in effect) passed in 1994. In 2014, as vice president, he served as the point person for the Obama administration\u2019s unsuccessful push for tougher gun laws following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Biden\u2019s campaign is also proposing the creation of a task force to \u201cstudy rampant online sexual harassment, stalking, and threats, including revenge porn and deepfakes \u2014 and the connection between this harassment, mass shootings, extremism and violence against women.\u201d The plan also takes aim at a favorite proposal of some conservatives in response to school shootings. A theoretical Biden administration would bar the use of federal funds to train teachers on how to use guns.",

      "author": "Hayley Miller",
      "content": " President Donald Trump on Wednesday repeatedly evaded questions from reporters about comments he made during a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky regarding Joe Biden. During a press conference at the White House with Finland\u2019s President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, Reuters correspondent Jeff Mason asked Trump to explain what exactly he had wanted Zelensky to do about the former vice president and his son, Hunter. In his long-winded response, Trump defended his phone call with Zelensky and bashed Europe for not giving more money to Ukraine. He then told Mason to ask Niinist\u00f6 a question, but another reporter interrupted to press Trump about Biden. \u201cLook, Biden and his son are stone cold crooked,\u201d Trump claimed. \u201cYou know it and so do we.\u201d Trump has accused then-Vice President Biden of calling for the removal of a corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine for the purpose of impeding an investigation into the Ukrainian gas company upon whose board Hunter Biden was serving. Ukrainian authorities have cleared Biden of any wrongdoing. Mason pushed Trump again: \u201cBut the question, sir, was what did you want President Zelensky to do about Vice President Biden and his son Hunter?\u201d \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d Trump asked after a few moments of silence. \u201cHaven\u2019t you finished with me? Listen, we have the president of Finland. Ask him a question.\u201d But Mason continued to press Trump to answer the question, drawing heated pushback from the president. \u201cAsk him a question,\u201d Trump said, motioning to Niinist\u00f6. \u201cDon\u2019t be rude. ... I\u2019ve answered everything. It\u2019s a whole hoax. And you know who\u2019s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media.\u201d Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky is the subject of a whistleblower complaint filed by a U.S. intelligence official in August, which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to open a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump last week. Trump has repeatedly claimed his conversation with Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d and that he\u2019s the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d orchestrated by Democrats. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before a congressional committee last week that he believes the whistleblower, who has not been identified publicly, \u201cacted in good faith\u201d and \u201cfollowed the law\u201d when filing the complaint. The whirlwind press conference Wednesday was eyebrow-raising from the start, with Niinist\u00f6 imploring Trump to keep American democracy alive. \u201cMr. President, you have here a great democracy. Keep it going on,\u201d the Finnish president told Trump, who raised his eyebrows and nodded in response. Niinist\u00f6 also pushed for global action on climate change and urged Trump to work with world leaders on trade. Asked to elaborate on his democracy comments, Niinist\u00f6 said, \u201cI just wanted to tell him that I\u2019m impressed with what the American people have gained during these decades, these 100 or so years. ... So keep it going on.\u201d",

      "content": " CNN has rejected two of President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign ads because they contain \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d assertions and \u201cstatements of fact that are not true.\u201d On Friday, the network confirmed its refusal to air the 30-second spots, which peddle unsubstantiated corruption allegations aimed at former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic rival to Trump in the 2020 election. The ads also claim the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry is \u201cnothing short of a coup\u201d and mock CNN employees as \u201cmedia lapdogs.\u201d The first ad, titled \u201cBiden Corruption\u201d and posted to YouTube last week, claims that during his time in the Obama administration, Biden \u201cpromised Ukraine $1 billion\u201d for the ouster of then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had previously led a probe of a Ukrainian firm on whose board Biden\u2019s son sat. The implication is that Biden was engaging in some shady, secretive dealing. In fact, Biden has spoken publicly\u00a0about how, acting on behalf of the Obama administration, he threatened to\u00a0withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee\u00a0if the Ukrainian government didn\u2019t dismiss Shokin. The U.S. was one of many countries urging Shokin\u2019s ouster on the grounds that he wasn\u2019t energetically pursuing corruption cases. There is no evidence that Biden was acting out of personal interest, and his son\u2019s past position has long been a matter of public record. The remainder of the ad maligns CNN\u2019s prime-time anchors Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon as journalists who are willing to \u201cfall in line\u201d with Democrats\u2019 pursuit of an impeachment inquiry over Trump\u2019s documented requests for Ukrainian assistance with a probe of the Bidens. Addressing that ad, a CNN spokesperson told HuffPost that \u201cit does not meet our advertising standards.\u201d \u201cSpecifically, in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN,\u201d the spokesperson said. The second Trump campaign ad, titled \u201cCoup\u201d and posted to YouTube on Wednesday, accuses Democrats of \u201ctrying to undo the election regardless of facts, attacking the president by any means necessary\u201d and \u201cfabricating evidence.\u201d It describes the impeachment inquiry as \u201cnothing short of a coup\u201d that \u201cmust be stopped.\u201d CNN told HuffPost that while it \u201caccepts political and advocacy advertising across the political spectrum,\u201d advertisers are required to \u201csubstantiate all factual claims made in their ads.\u201d \u201cWe cannot accept this ad as it contains statements of fact that are not true,\u201d the company said. \u201cSpecifically, the ad contains assertions of fact about the whistleblower complaint that have been refuted by the Intelligence Inspector General. In addition, it is inaccurate to use the word \u2018coup\u2019 to describe a constitutionally prescribed legal process.\u201d CNN said it has also received a third ad from the Trump campaign called \u201cChanging Things\u201d and that ad can be aired \u201cas it meets our commercial clearance standards.\u201d That spot, which was posted to YouTube on Thursday, appears less incendiary, focusing partly on job creation, trade and border security.",

Our campaign unequivocally does and builds on our strength each week.\u201d The campaign also noted that 56% of donors were new to the campaign, which it said indicates Biden\u2019s staying power and popularity in the race to unseat President Donald Trump. The total is notably less than that of at least two of his fellow candidates, although Biden is still the frontrunner in many polls. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has so far raised the most out of any 2020 Democrat, picking up $25.3 million in the third quarter. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised more than $19 million, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) garnered $11.6 million. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who rose dramatically in polls over the summer, has not yet released her third quarter fundraising numbers. Biden has been at the center of the unfolding scandal over Trump\u2019s call with the leader of Ukraine earlier this year. During that conversation, Trump repeatedly pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Before the call, Trump ordered his administration to withhold military aid from the country. Democrats have cast the conversation as an unprecedented move by a president to solicit political help from a foreign power as part of a quid pro quo, although Trump has rejected those claims. It\u2019s unclear if the drama will damage Biden\u2019s chances in the presidential race.\u00a0Neither Biden has been accused of wrongdoing in the matter, and House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s behavior. Biden has gone on the offensive in recent days, firing back at the White House for waging what he called a campaign of \u201clies, smears, distortions and name calling.\u201d During a speech to supporters on Thursday, Biden continued to lambaste Trump but said he remained optimistic about this chances in 2020. \u201cDon\u2019t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative,\u201d Biden said, according to a pool report, before he went on to cite polls from Ohio and Michigan that put him above Trump. \u201cI thought those polls are wrong until Trump decided to go after me \u2015 so now I know they\u2019re right.\u201d Trump, for his part, had a very good financial summer. His reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised a combined $125 million in the third quarter, a figure so large many Democratic leaders warned that the road ahead will not be easy. The two groups currently have more than $156 million cash on hand, double what former President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee had at this point before the 2012 election, Politico noted.",

      "content": " President Donald Trump insisted Friday that \u201cthe Republicans are very unified\u201d in supporting him amid accusations that he improperly asked foreign leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 political rival. But that\u2019s not entirely true. While the Democratic-controlled House begins an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s conversations with the Ukrainian government about Biden, which were revealed after a whistleblower complaint, cracks are beginning to show in the Republican Party\u2019s front. Trump\u2019s public call Thursday for China to investigate Biden, too, appears to have pushed some members of the GOP over the edge. Here\u2019s a running list of Republicans who are speaking out about Trump\u2019s apparent attempts to compel foreign governments to aid his reelection campaign. Sen. Mitt Romney\u00a0of Utah made the biggest splash Friday of any Republican so far when he slammed Trump\u2019s \u201cbrazen and unprecedented\u201d calls for foreign meddling in the 2020 presidential election as \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d \u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u201d Romney said. The week before, Romney also spoke out about Trump\u2019s July phone call with the president of Ukraine. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott was the first Republican governor to publicly support an impeachment inquiry into Trump. The action is \u201cappropriate,\u201d he said in late September. \u201cCongress has a solemn responsibility to every American to fulfill its role in our government system of checks and balances,\u201d he said. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker also told reporters in September that he supported an impeachment inquiry. \u201cIt\u2019s a deeply disturbing situation and circumstance,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think the proper role and responsibility for Congress at this point is to investigate it and get to the bottom of it.\u201d Republican Jim Steineke, the GOP leader of the Wisconsin State Assembly, took a stand against Trump on Friday after the president insisted on Twitter that he was right to ask other countries to investigate Biden. His behavior \u201ccannot be normalized,\u201d Steineke tweeted. Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska couldn\u2019t defend Trump\u2019s actions when speaking to reporters in September. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously some very troubling things here,\u201d he said, though he stopped short of supporting an impeachment inquiry. \u201cDemocrats ought not to be using the word \u2018impeach\u2019 before they had the whistleblower complaint or read any of the transcript,\u201d he added, referring to the July 25 call with the Ukraine president. But he also criticized Republicans for turning a blind eye. \u201cRepublicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there\u2019s no there there when there\u2019s obviously a lot that\u2019s very troubling there.\u201d Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, one of several Republican lawmakers to announce in recent months that he won\u2019t seek reelection, told CNN last week that copies of text messages exchanged among U.S. diplomats about Trump\u2019s actions \u201care indeed damning.\u201d \u201cI think this is serious stuff; these are serious matters,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has long-term implications on our foreign policy.\u201d Trump\u2019s public call for China to investigate Biden, he added, \u201cis terrible.\u201d Maine\u2019s Sen. Susan Collins, another fairly regular Trump critic, told reporters over the weekend that she couldn\u2019t stand by his comments about China. \u201cI thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely inappropriate.\u201d She also said she expected the House\u2019s impeachment probe would make its way to the Senate. \u201cShould the articles of impeachment come to the Senate \u2014 and right now I\u2019m going to guess that they will \u2014 I will be acting as a juror as I did in the Clinton impeachment trial,\u201d Collins said. Rob Portman of Ohio said there was no question as to whether Trump was wrong to bring Biden up with the Ukrainians. \u201cThe president should not have raised the Biden issue on that call, period,\u201d he told The Columbus Dispatch on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate for a president to engage a foreign government in an investigation of a political opponent.\u201d However, he also said he didn\u2019t view that as an impeachable offense. Portman, notably, was among a bipartisan group of senators in 2016 who wrote a letter to Ukraine\u2019s president criticizing a Ukrainian prosecutor for corruption in his office. That prosecutor is the same one Trump has baselessly insisted Biden unfairly targeted because he was investigating a Ukrainian company for which his son, Hunter Biden, served on the board \u2015 the relationship at the center of Trump\u2019s request that Ukraine dig up dirt on the Bidens.

And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\u201d Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal impeachment inquiry in response to a whistleblower complaint\u00a0about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The complaint said the call revealed Trump \u201cpressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals.\u201d According to the White House\u2019s summary of the July call, Trump asked Zelensky to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and U.S. Attorney General William Barr to investigate Biden, a front-runner in the Democratic race, as well as his son Hunter, based on unfounded corruption allegations. Trump has accused Biden of seeking the removal of a prosecutor in Ukraine when he was Obama\u2019s vice president, supposedly in order to impede an investigation into the Ukrainian gas company on whose board his son was serving. Ukrainian authorities have cleared Biden of any wrongdoing. Earlier Wednesday, Trump repeatedly evaded questions from reporters about comments he made about Biden during the July phone call, including a question on what exactly he had wanted Zelensky to do about the former vice president and his son. \u201cLook, Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked,\u201d Trump claimed amid a long-winded response. \u201cYou know it, and so do we.\u201d Biden said Trump\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d involving Ukraine was because the president was \u201cafraid.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November,\u201d Biden said, according to his prepared remarks. Earlier this week, Biden\u2019s campaign urged TV news outlets to stop putting Giuliani on the air, saying the president\u2019s personal lawyer was spreading \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine during Biden\u2019s vice presidency. Last week, Joe Biden said he was in favor of impeaching Trump if the president refuses to comply with Congress\u2019s investigations. After the release of the White House summary of Trump\u2019s July call with Ukraine, Biden called the president\u2019s actions \u201can impeachable offense.\u201d Biden joined the rest of the leading Democratic candidates who had been calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment for months. Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called for Trump\u2019s impeachment in late spring in response to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s April report and May public statement about his investigation into Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference and possible obstruction of justice by Trump. In his Nevada remarks Wednesday, Biden repeated his description of Trump\u2019s actions as an \u201cabuse of power\u201d and said the president placed his \u201cown personal gain ahead of the public good.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not backing down. And I\u2019m not going to be distracted by the lies, smears, distortions and name-calling,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m going to let Congress do its job on impeachment.\u201d",

Ruslan Ryaboshapka\u2019s comments came amid an impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump that relates to a call he made to the Ukrainian president asking him to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate and his son\u2019s work in Ukraine. Ryaboshapka told reporters in Kyiv that prosecutors are auditing all the cases that were closed or dismissed by former prosecutors, including several related to Mykola Zlochevsky, owner of the gas company Burisma that hired Hunter Biden in 2014, at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son. \u201cWe are now reviewing all the cases that were closed or split into several parts or were investigated before, in order to be able to rule to reverse those cases where illegal procedural steps were taken,\u201d Ryaboshapka said. When asked by a reporter if they are reviewing cases related to Burisma and Zlochevsky, he said that there are 15 cases where Zlochevsky and businessman Serhiy Kurchenko are mentioned. He did not specify how many, if any, were related to Hunter Biden\u2019s work at Burisma. Ryaboshapka was mentioned in the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who assured Trump that Ryaboshapka was \u201chis man\u201d and that he would resume investigations into Burisma. The prosecutor general insisted on Friday that he did not feel any pressure over the Burisma case. \u201cNot a single foreign or Ukrainian official or politician has called me or tried to influence my decisions regarding specific criminal cases,\u201d he said. A whistleblower last month revealed that Trump in a phone call asked Zelenskiy to resume the probe into Joe Biden and his son. The July 25 call has since triggered an impeachment inquiry against Trump. ___ Nataliya Vasilyeva contributed to this report from Moscow.",

Poroshenko, elected Ukraine\u2019s leader in 2014, left office in May after Volodymyr Zelensky defeated him in the country\u2019s presidential election. According to a whistleblower complaint filed by a U.S. intelligence official, Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate Biden, a Democratic front-runner in the 2020 presidential race, and his son, Hunter. Trump has claimed that Biden, as vice president, called for the removal of a corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine to impede an investigation into a Ukrainian gas company that had Hunter Biden on its board. A\u00a0bipartisan congressional caucus on Ukraine and other world leaders also were calling for the removal of the prosecutor at the time. Ukrainian authorities later cleared Hunter Biden of any wrongdoing. The whistleblower complaint prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) last week to announce the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.

Asked whether he thought it was \u201cappropriate\u201d that Trump\u00a0suggested both China\u00a0and Ukraine should investigate the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden, Pence told reporters that he and Trump were elected to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d \u201cI think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position as vice president during the last administration,\u201d he told reporters at the roundtable event with Latino business leaders in Scottsdale, Arizona. Trump is now facing an impeachment inquiry stemming from a\u00a0whistleblower complaint from within the intelligence community\u00a0alleging that Trump repeatedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family while also withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid for the war-torn country.\u00a0The complaint also claims that White House officials attempted to cover up the misconduct. After the White House released a summary the July 25 phone call at the center of the complaint and congressional investigators released a redacted version of the complaint, Trump began openly calling on foreign leaders to investigate the Biden family over Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings while his father was vice president. \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House earlier Thursday. \u201cI would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump also said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) launched a formal impeachment probe into the growing scandal after the whistleblower complaint pointed to clear evidence of Trump soliciting foreign interference in the election. Pence has been drawn into the scandal after The Washington Post reported Wednesday that the vice president\u2019s top aide was on the phone call in which Trump pushed Zelensky to look into the Bidens. According to the Post, Pence would have had a copy of the transcript of the call before he met with Zelensky in September. However, an official who spoke to the paper said Pence wasn\u2019t aware of Trump\u2019s efforts to encourage an investigation. Speaking at the roundtable on Thursday, Pence said Trump had tasked him with meeting with Zelensky to discuss a \u201clack of European support\u201d and \u201ccorruption.\u201d He continued to defend Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, insisting that \u201cthe president was raising issues that were appropriate and of genuine interest to the American people.\u201d Trump\u2019s calls for a Biden investigation stem from Hunter Biden\u2019s position as a board member of a Ukrainian gas company. The president has been pushing the debunked theory that then-Vice President Joe Biden called for the removal of a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor to impede an investigation into the company. At the time, a bipartisan group of lawmakers had also pushed for anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, as CNN reported.\u00a0Ukrainian authorities later cleared Hunter Biden of any wrongdoing.",

Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), co-chairs of the bipartisan Senate Ukraine Caucus, pressed Ukraine\u2019s then-President Petro Poroshenko to take action on \u201centrenched corruption\u201d within his government. \u201cWe recognize \u200ethat your governing coalition faces not only endemic corruption left from decades of mismanagement and cronyism, but also an illegal armed seizure of territory by Russia and its proxies,\u201d they wrote in the letter. \u201d[We] urge you to press ahead with urgent reforms to the Prosecutor General\u2019s office and judiciary.\u201d The letter \u2015 also signed by Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) \u2015\u00a0appears to undermine President Donald Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that there was \u201cquid pro quo\u201d when then-Vice President Biden withheld aid to Ukraine to push the country\u2019s leaders to fire its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. Trump claims Biden did so for the purpose of impeding an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company upon whose board Hunter Biden served.\u00a0No evidence has been brought to light to suggest this. Biden boasted in 2018 about withholding $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to get them to oust Shokin, which Trump has claimed amounts to a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d But foreign policy experts, including a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, say Biden\u2019s actions were an appropriate form of diplomatic pressure. Biden wasn\u2019t the only person calling for Shokin\u2019s removal from office. Members of Congress (as evidenced by the 2016 letter of support), European leaders and international organizations were all pushing for the notoriously corrupt prosecutor to be fired. Shokin\u2019s office had opened an investigation into Burisma, but it was dormant by the time Biden was working on anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine.\u00a0Ukrainian authorities have cleared Biden of any wrongdoing related to Shokin\u2019s firing. Neither Portman nor Kirk, who is no longer in office, immediately responded to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment. Johnson wrote a letter with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) last week that, in part, called on Attorney General William Barr to investigate allegations that Biden called for Shokin\u2019s removal to help his son. \u201cThe United States, the European Union, the I.M.F., and Ukraine\u2019s leading reform figures were all pressing for Viktor Shokin to be removed from office because he was one of the biggest obstacles to fighting corruption in the entire country,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates told HuffPost in a statement. \u201cThis was a bipartisan goal in Congress as well,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is unfortunate that Senator Johnson seems to have forgotten a time when he put the country\u2019s values over his own politics, but perhaps re-reading his well-articulated words whole-heartedly agreeing with Joe Biden\u2019s push to move the anti-corruption cause in Ukraine forward will help him on his journey back to intellectual consistency.\u201d Asked for comment, a spokesperson for Johnson referred HuffPost to comments the senator made Wednesday during an interview with radio station WRRD. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s true, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s not true,\u201d Johnson said while discussing some of the issues referenced in the letter he wrote with Grassley. \u201cIf something happened, the American people should know. If something didn\u2019t happen, the American people need to know so we can get this behind us. It\u2019s about uncovering the truth.\u201d Trump\u2019s obsession with Biden\u2019s dealings with Ukraine resulted in a whistleblower complaint filed in August by a U.S. intelligence official that alleges Trump repeatedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and may have withheld military aid as leverage. The complaint prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to announce the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump last week. Democrats say Trump\u2019s exchange with Zelensky amounts to an attempt to seek foreign interference in the 2020 election. Trump has claimed his call with Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d and that he withheld aid because he was annoyed that European allies were not paying enough. He praised Portman on Wednesday for backing up that explanation, declaring \u201cthere\u2019s nobody more honorable\u201d\u00a0than him. The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.",

      "content": " Nearly three years and some 7,000 falsehoods into his term and now under threat of impeachment, President Donald Trump continues pushing one of his biggest lies yet: That Joe Biden while vice president intervened overseas on his son\u2019s behalf. \u201cSleepy Joe Biden \u2026 forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son\u2019s company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine,\u201d Trump wrote in a statement he posted on Twitter last month. \u201cThe Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple!\u201d he wrote Sunday. Yet Trump\u2019s claims about Biden are not only unfounded, but a review of the timeline shows they turn facts and recent history on their head \u2015 a black-is-white, night-is-day reinterpretation to advance Trump\u2019s political goal. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to wrap your head around,\u201d said Robert Weissman, president of the liberal group Public Citizen, adding that trying to understand Trump\u2019s claims on the topic first requires \u201ca re-read of \u2018Alice in Wonderland.\u2019\u201d Biden had been pushing for anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine since shortly after he became vice president in 2009 \u2015 not as a freelance effort, but as part of the entire U.S. government and its Western allies\u2019 attempts to improve the business climate for investment there and nudge the country away from Russia. Biden\u2019s son Hunter did not join the Ukrainian energy company Burisma\u2019s board until 2014. And the push to increase corruption investigations in Ukraine was likely to hurt Burisma, not help it. That\u2019s because the probes were being thwarted to protect Burisma\u2019s owner when Joe Biden told Ukrainian officials that $1 billion in loan guarantees would be blocked if the country\u2019s prosecutor general at the time was not fired. That prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was generally regarded as corrupt and unwilling to press cases against politically connected targets. Following the vice president\u2019s ultimatum, Shokin was ousted in March 2016. \u201cDonald Trump is so terrified of facing off against Joe Biden in 2020 that he committed an unprecedented abuse of power and threw his presidency into free fall by trying to force Ukraine to spread a universally debunked, right-wing conspiracy theory about him,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cNow he\u2019s melting-down on television and publicly begging other foreign countries to bail his flailing campaign out with lies.\u201d Yet for Trump, attacking Biden while simultaneously trying to enmesh him in a previously separate conspiracy theory that absolves both Trump and Russia from questions about foreign meddling in the 2016 election has become an obsession, one top longtime Trump adviser told HuffPost. Not only is Trump making baseless remarks about it in public and on Twitter, he has dispatched the Justice Department, the State Department and his private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to travel the globe to prove it true. \u201cHe\u2019s a one-man wrecking crew,\u201d the adviser said on condition of anonymity. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he just doesn\u2019t get over it. Everybody wishes he would knock it off.\u201d Trump\u2019s White House did not respond to HuffPost queries for this story. Authoritarianism expert Ruth Ben-Ghiat, meanwhile, said that Trump\u2019s increasing willingness to use his executive branch agencies to further his re-election campaign and to block investigations into him has dangerous historical parallels \u2015 such as Italian strongman Benito Mussolini in the 1930s. \u201cMussolini did this before he shut down an investigation that was ruining him by declaring dictatorship,\u201d said Ben-Ghiat, a New York University history professor. \u201cThe openness of it all is the next stage of declaring you are above the law.\u201d   Trump and his top advisers decided last year that Biden would be his toughest general election opponent in 2020, and Trump long has been frequently attacking him in Twitter statements and public comments. But earlier this year, that desire to hurt Biden\u2019s candidacy merged with a sweeping conspiracy theory that Giuliani began pushing that wove together many of the president\u2019s longtime angsts \u2015 a unified Trump grievance theory, of sorts. According to this scheme, as described on various right-wing internet pages and talk radio hosts, Russia did not actually interfere in the 2016 election to help Trump but was only made to look as if it had by forces in Ukraine loyal to former President Barack Obama. They worked to get GOP consultant Paul Manafort elevated to run Trump\u2019s campaign in the spring of 2016 so they could then reveal his corruption later that summer, forcing Trump to fire him. Proof of all this, according to these conspiracy theorists, will be revealed when the Democratic National Committee server that was hacked in 2016 is found in Ukraine, possibly along with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s 33,000 deleted emails. (The theory fails to explain why Obama and his supposed Ukrainian operatives did not publicize the Trump campaign\u2019s connections with Russian spies before the election, rather than only afterward, thereby allowing him to win.) Not a single part of the conspiracy theory has any basis in fact. But Trump embraced it because, the White House adviser said, it meshes with his unwillingness to accept that Russia helped him win the 2016 election. Not only did Trump bring up the far-fetched theory during the now-infamous July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, but he dispatched Attorney General William Barr to find evidence for it, which Barr has been doing much of this year during unpublicized trips overseas, including one last month to Italy. Ironically, Trump\u2019s readiness to accept Giuliani\u2019s debunked conspiracy theory as fact is now likely to get him impeached by the House. \u201cIf he continues to focus on that white whale, it\u2019s going to bring him down,\u201d former Trump homeland security adviser Tom Bossert told ABC News last month. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a conspiracy, it is completely debunked\u2026. The DNC server and that conspiracy theory has got to go, they have to stop with that, it cannot continue to be repeated in our discourse.\u201d That debunked theory, of course, was one of the topics during that July 25 phone call \u2015 which wound up triggering the House impeachment inquiry after a whistleblower filed a complaint accusing Trump of soliciting campaign help from Ukraine\u2019s president. That account was then backed up by a rough transcript of the call that Trump ordered released late last month. Additional whistleblowers are now corroborating concerns about the call, as well. How much those accounts are even relevant at this point is unclear. Trump has repeatedly defended his decision to hold up $400 million in aid to Ukraine and to then ask Zelensky to investigate Biden. Last week on the White House South Lawn, he asked a second country to target Biden and his son. \u201cBy the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with \u2015 with Ukraine,\u201d he said before climbing aboard a Marine helicopter on his way to Florida. Democrats are proceeding under the notion that merely asking for that assistance is an impeachable abuse of power. And so far, at least a few Republican senators \u2015 20 of whom would be needed to remove Trump from office \u2015 are giving signals that they might agree. \u201cI thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent. It\u2019s completely inappropriate,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said\u00a0over the weekend. She added that she would not comment further: \u201cShould the articles of impeachment come to the Senate, and right now I\u2019m going to guess that they will, I will be acting as a juror as I did\u201d in the 1999 impeachment trial of then-President Bil Clinton.   Trump, despite the impeachment inquiry he has sparked, seems undeterred. He continues to repeat his false accusations against Biden, and even had his campaign put $10 million into a TV ad to repeat them on national television. (At least one cable network has refused to run the ad because of its blatant falsehoods.) Yet as galling as Trump critics find the false corruption accusations is the fact that Trump has the audacity to make them. Since taking office, Trump has steered his campaign, his party, other Republican candidates and groups, lobbyists with business before the executive branch and foreign governments to use his hotels and golf courses, from which he personally profits. Currently, he is pushing the U.S. government to host the next G-7 meeting at his own golf resort in Doral, Florida \u2013 which would put tens of millions of American taxpayer dollars into his own pocket, as well. Both actions are a dictionary definition of corruption \u2015 using an official position to enrich oneself \u2015 and Trump is doing them out in the open. \u201cThis is not just the most corrupt president but the most blatantly corrupt,\u201d said Jordan Libowitz, an official with the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Public Citizen\u2019s Weissman said that Trump\u2019s Orwellian insistence that Americans believe him, rather than the evidence of their own eyes, is even more corrosive to democracy. \u201cThere\u2019s a deeper problem in the corruption of our language, and the corruption of our notion of reality, and the corruption of our idea of truth,\u201d he said. And while ethics groups agree that Hunter Biden\u2019s work overseas in the years that his father was vice president created at least the appearance of a conflict of interest for his father, Trump, they say, has little standing to criticize it. Not only does his elder daughter, son-in-law and two adult sons continue to benefit financially from Trump\u2019s presidency, but Trump himself continues to benefit from projects in countries affected by decisions he makes as president. This week, for example, Trump was informed that Turkey intended to move into northern Syria to attack Kurdish forces who had been critical allies in the U.S. war against Islamic State terrorists in Syria and Iraq. Trump responded by deciding to withdraw U.S. troops from the area and then inviting Turkey\u2019s authoritarian ruler, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to visit the White House next month. Trump has a licensing deal with Trump Towers Istanbul that has provided him as much as $7 million over the last three years \u2015 a business arrangement Trump himself conceded was a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d before he was elected. Libowitz said Turkish officials had also made 14 visits to Trump\u2019s hotel near the White House \u2015 more than by any other country. \u201cIf President Trump wants to talk about corruption, we\u2019re all for that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut talk of corruption starts at home, or in this case, five blocks from his home.\u201d Trump, nevertheless, appears unfazed by sinking poll numbers and rising public support for his removal from office. On Monday, during a White House photo opportunity, he appeared to lump House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, both California Democrats, into the conspiracy against him. \u201cThey should really be looked at very strongly because what they did is unthinkable.\u00a0 What they did to this country is unthinkable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that we get to the bottom.\u201d",

      "author": "Hayley Miller",
      "content": " As Sunday morning political talk shows debated and discussed the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and his dealings with Ukraine, there was a glaring absence from their lineups: White House officials. Last week, senior White House adviser Stephen Miller defended Trump on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave interviews to ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d and CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d the week before. This week birthed several major developments regarding impeachment and Trump\u2019s push for foreign leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, his potential Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential election. But not a single White House official made the Sunday morning rounds this week on the\u00a0\u201cbig five\u201d networks: ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and CNN. The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. Jake Tapper, host of CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d said Sunday that his show invited the White House to participate, but it did not offer a guest. Trump\u2019s personal attorneys,\u00a0Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, as well as top Republicans in the House and Senate were also invited but either declined or did not respond, he said. A spokesperson for Fox News said the network was unable to book a White House official for Sunday\u2019s program. \u201cWe reached out for relevant White House guests and we were told they were unavailable, so we went with bipartisan members of the House Intelligence committee leading the impeachment inquiry,\u201d the spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement. ABC, CBS and NBC did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment about whether White House officials also snubbed their programs. The lack of White House officials on Sunday shows didn\u2019t stop Trump and his allies from rolling out his defense. Republican lawmakers appeared ready to push the White House\u2019s narrative on Sunday, shrugging off news that a second whistleblower had come forward with firsthand information about Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the center of the impeachment inquiry. Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), a member of the House Intelligence Committee that\u2019s investigating Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he\u2019s \u201cnot at all\u201d concerned about a second whistleblower. Giuliani appeared on Fox News late Sunday morning, where he shouted at host Howard Kurtz for pushing back on his Ukraine conspiracy theories. \u201cCould you just listen for one second?\u201d Giuliani shouted at Kurtz, who later shook his head in disbelief. \u201cYou don\u2019t let me get a sentence out. You contradict me immediately.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether ABC, CBS and NBC refrained from inviting Giuliani on their programs Sunday after Biden\u2019s campaign sent a letter to the \u201cbig five\u201d networks last week urging them to not invite the former New York City mayor as a guest. \u201cGiving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism,\u201d a pair of top Biden advisers wrote in the letter. Trump, whose White House hasn\u2019t given a press briefing in months, fired off a spate of tweets during the Sunday morning shows that attacked Democrats and doubled down on his call for Biden to be investigated. \u201cIt is INCREDIBLE to watch and read the Fake News and how they pull out all stops to protect Sleepy Joe Biden and his thrown out of the Military son, Hunter,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cAs lawyers & others have stated, as President, I have an OBLIGATION to look into possible, or probable, CORRUPTION!\u201d None of the Republican guests on this week\u2019s Sunday morning talk shows offered a direct answer when asked if there was a record of Trump asking foreign leaders to investigate any other American besides Biden on corruption.

      "content": " Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has excoriated The New York Times for helping to spread what it described as a \u201cbaseless conspiracy theory\u201d advanced by President Donald Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, and for prioritizing sensationalism over \u201ctruth and judiciousness.\u201d \u201cAre you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016,\u201d Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield wrote in a Wednesday letter addressed to the Times\u2019 executive editor Dean Baquet. \u201cOr are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it?\u201d The letter, obtained by Oliver Darcy, a senior media reporter at CNN, accused the Times of \u201cactive participation\u201d in the \u201csmear campaign\u201d against Biden concocted by Trump and his allies. The Trump camp has been pushing a conspiracy theory for months about Biden\u2019s alleged corruption in his dealings with Ukraine. They claim Biden, during his tenure as vice president, withheld $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to compel the country\u2019s firing of a top prosecutor in order to protect his son, Hunter Biden. While it\u2019s true that Biden, following a foreign policy position of the Obama administration, urged Ukrainian leaders to oust the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, there\u2019s no evidence that he did it to help his son. Despite the facts, the Times still disseminated this conspiracy theory, Bedingfield said. She pointed specifically to a\u00a0widely criticized\u00a0article\u00a0published in the paper on May 1 that said in its headline that Biden was facing \u201cconflict of interest questions\u201d regarding Ukraine that were \u201cbeing promoted by Trump and allies.\u201d The story, written by reporter Ken Vogel and freelance writer Iuliia Mendel, described how Biden had appealed to Ukrainian leaders for Shokin\u2019s ouster and how his son Hunter Biden had a \u201cstake in the outcome\u201d as he was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that had been in Shokin\u2019s \u201csights.\u201d Vogel\u2019s and Mendel\u2019s story included a line stating that \u201cno evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing\u201d for Shokin\u2019s dismissal. However, as The Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemple pointed out at the time, that caveat comes 19 paragraphs into the story. \u201cIn those first 19 paragraphs is a knot of details bound to be mangled by cable-news hosts and pundits in the coming months,\u201d Wemple, the Post\u2019s media critic, wrote in a column. In her letter to Baquet, Bedingfield pointed out that the Times\u2019 reporting had promptly been challenged by Bloomberg News, which said the investigation into Burisma had been \u201cdormant\u201d at the time Biden was discussing Shokin\u2019s future with Ukrainian leaders. Bedingfield also noted that Mendel, one of the co-authors of the Times story, joined the Ukrainian government as a spokesperson for the president of Ukraine\u00a0just weeks after the article was published. Biden\u2019s campaign also took issue with an op-ed critical of the Bidens published in the Times on Wednesday by author Peter Schweizer, who was lambasted by Bedingfield as a \u201cdiscredited, right-wing polemicist.\u201d Schweizer \u201chas been one of the top people pushing the claim that Biden abused his office,\u201d Darcy wrote in CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources newsletter,\u00a0adding that Schweizer \u2015 a senior contributor at right-wing site Breitbart \u2015 previously pushed the debunked conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton benefiting from a \u201cpay-for-play\u201d scheme involving uranium reserves. In response to the Biden campaign\u2019s letter, the Times defended its coverage of Biden and his son as \u201cfair and accurate.\u201d The Times\u00a0\u201cwill continue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race and we\u2019re happy to sit down with Biden advisers anytime to discuss news coverage,\u201d a spokesman told Darcy, adding that Schweizer\u2019s op-ed had been published in the Opinion section of the newspaper, \u201cwhere their mission is to invite intelligent discussion on a range of opinions and ideas.\u201d Bedingfield\u2019s dressing-down of the Times follows two other letters sent this week by the Biden campaign to Facebook and Twitter. In those letters, Biden\u2019s team criticized the companies for allowing a Trump campaign video ad that pushes the Biden-Ukraine conspiracy to run on their platforms \u2015 and urged them to block the clip. Facebook has refused to remove the ad, citing a \u201cfundamental belief in free expression\u201d and \u201crespect for the democratic process.\u201d Twitter has yet to respond publicly to the request. The dissemination of \u201cobjectively false information to influence public opinion poisons the public discourse and chips away at our democracy,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo said in a statement about the ad to CNN. \u201cWhether it originates from the Kremlin or Trump Tower, these lies and conspiracy theories threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections in America,\u201d Ducklo added. As NBC News\u2019 Dylan Byers reported Wednesday, Facebook and Twitter aren\u2019t the only platforms that have continued to air Trump\u2019s Biden-Ukraine ad despite its unfounded content. CNN is the only media or tech company that\u2019s banned the ad from its airwaves, Byers said. NBC News, ABC News and YouTube are among the organizations that have not.",

      "subtitle": "The former vice president isn\u2019t planning to make all college free or erase student debt. But his 2020 campaign insists his higher education plan is just as bold.",
      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " The 2020 presidential field is full of candidates with ambitious plans for higher education. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants to erase all student debt and make public universities tuition-free. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Ma.) wants to eliminate tuition at public universities and wipe out most student loan debt. Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s plan, released Tuesday morning, aims neither to make all public universities free nor eliminate student debt. But his campaign insists his plan is just as big. \u201cWe reject any premise this plan is not equally bold as those plans,\u201d said a senior campaign official on the phone with reporters. \u201cThe Biden plan reflects the vice president\u2019s and Dr. [Jill] Biden\u2019s deep commitment to making sure every child in this country can pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree or community college.\u201d Biden\u2019s plan focuses on improving access to community college and making all college more affordable for needy students. The Biden family has a strong connection to community college: His wife, Jill, who has a doctorate in education, has spent much of her career teaching in one. \u201cThey work so hard and ask for only one thing in return: opportunity,\u201d Jill Biden said on the call. Through legislation, Joe Biden aims to make community college tuition-free for all students for up to two years, with the federal government covering 75% of the cost and states covering the rest. Beyond tuition, qualifying students could use Pell grants and state aid to cover the rest of their expenses, according to the plan. Much of Biden\u2019s vision for higher education builds on what he started with former President Barack Obama, according to campaign officials. The Obama administration proposed tuition-free community college in 2015. However, Biden\u2019s plan also includes a number of measures that would also help students complete their degrees. He proposes a grant that would help community colleges create an emergency fund for students undergoing unexpected financial hardships. The plan also includes an $8 billion investment in community college facilities. Biden\u2019s proposal seeks to make a dent in college debt, albeit one that is specific and targeted to individuals making below a certain amount of money. Biden says he would double the maximum value of Pell grants \u2015 a grant for low-income students that does not need to be repaid. Under a Biden presidency, people making less than $25,000 a year wouldn\u2019t have to make loan repayments or accrue interest, though everyone else would have to pay 5% of their discretionary income. In contrast, Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s student debt plans are far more expansive. Sanders has announced his intention to cancel nearly all student loan debt, regardless of a debtors\u2019 income. Warren would eliminate a portion of debt for every household making below $250,000. Biden\u2019s plan also includes major investments in historically black colleges and universities, tribal colleges and universities, and other minority-serving institutions, including $18 billion in grants and $20 billion for infrastructure. \u201cStudent debt both exacerbates and results from [the] racial wealth gap,\u201d according to the plan.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Two associates of President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani are in law enforcement custody and have been indicted on federal campaign finance charges for allegedly making fraudulent straw donations and funneling foreign money to support Trump and Republican Party candidates. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who helped Giuliani investigate allegations against Joe Biden and his son Hunter, are accused of illegally funding American political campaigns.\u00a0The Wall Street Journal, which first\u00a0reported\u00a0the arrests, said that Parnas and Fruman had donated to Trump\u2019s campaign as well as a pro-Trump super PAC. The charges emerged from the Southern District of New York, but a Justice Department spokesman said the duo would appear at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, at 2 p.m., before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael S. Nachmanoff. U.S. Attorney Geoff Berman said at a press conference Thursday that Parnas and Fruman both had one-way international tickets when they were arrested, and that the investigation is ongoing.\u00a0Giuliani had lunch with the duo at the Trump International Hotel just hours before their scheduled flight, according to the Journal. Separately on Thursday, House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry into Trump\u00a0issued subpoenas to Parnas and Fruman\u00a0demanding documents related to their work with Giuliani. Before the two were arrested, House investigators had requested that Parnas appear for a deposition Thursday, and Fruman for one on Friday, but their counsel said Tuesday that they would decline. The indictment alleges that Parnas and Fruman committed to raising more than $20,000 for a sitting U.S. congressman, and that Parnas \u201cmet with Congressman-1 and sought Congressman-1\u2032s assistance in causing the U.S. Government to remove or recall the then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.\u201d \u201cCongressman-1\u201d is former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), who sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking for Marie Yovanovitch to be removed as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine after his meeting with Parnas, according to the Texas Observer. Parnas and Fruman are alleged to have concocted a straw donation scheme to hide their political contributions and give in excess of the campaign contribution limits. A $325,000 donation to the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action was made in the name of Global Energy Producers LLC, a shell corporation purporting to be engaged in the liquified natural gas business, according to the indictment. Donations made to Republican Party candidates in Parnas\u2019 name were actually funded by Fruman, prosecutors allege.\u00a0It is illegal to make a campaign contribution in someone else\u2019s name.\u00a0These donations included maximum $2,700 contributions to Sessions and House Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Prosecutors say the illegal foreign donations made through Parnas and Fruman went to \u201cpoliticians and candidates for federal and state office.\u201d The indictment refers to specific donations to two Nevada state Republican Party politicians. State campaign finance records show the only two Nevada candidates to receive such contributions were gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt and attorney general candidate Wes Duncan. The Nevada contributions were allegedly made as part of a failed attempt to secure licenses for a legal cannabis business venture. The foreign donor \u2015 who is only identified as Foreign National-1 and described as a \u201cRussian citizen and businessman\u201d \u2015 allegedly wanted to remain anonymous due to \u201chis Russian roots and current political paranoia about it.\u201d The campaign finance allegations against Parnas and Fruman were first flagged to authorities by the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit campaign finance watchdog, in a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission in July 2018. \u201cThe public is now learning just how dangerous dark money can be in U.S. elections, including the potential for illegal foreign funds, which DOJ says were used here,\u201d Trevor Potter, Campaign Legal Center president and former counsel to Sen. John McCain, said in a statement. \u201cThe fact that these two individuals were working with Giuliani and Ukrainian government officials to alter U.S. policy in that country will obviously be relevant to the impeachment investigation.\u201d The indictment also names businessmen David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin as defendants. All four defendants are U.S. citizens. Parnas and Kukushkin were born in Ukraine, while Fruman was born in Belarus. Read the indictment below. This story has been updated with comment from the Campaign Legal Center and additional information.",

But Vice President Mike Pence stammered and dodged the question four times at a Wednesday press event in Waukee, Iowa. Here\u2019s the White House transcript of Pence\u2019s exchange with NBC News reporter Vaughn Hillyard: Q: But were you ever aware, Mr. Vice President, that interest in the Bidens \u2015 that interest in investigating the Bidens was at least in part of the reason for aid to Ukraine being held up? Were you ever aware? THE VICE PRESIDENT: I \u2015 what \u2015 I never discussed the issue of \u2015 the issue of the Bidens with President Zelensky and \u2015 Q: But within the administration, were you ever aware, within the administration? THE VICE PRESIDENT: What I can tell you is that all of our discussions internally \u2015 I mean the President and our team and our contacts, in my office, with Ukraine \u2015 were entirely focused on the broader issues of the lack of European support and corruption. Q: But you were aware of the interest in the Bidens being investigated \u2015 THE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I was \u2015 Q: \u2015 and that being tied to aid to Ukraine being held up? THE VICE PRESIDENT: What I \u2015 well, that\u2019s your question. Let me very clear: The issue of aid and our efforts, with regard to Ukraine, were, from my experience, in no way connected to the very legitimate concern the American people had about corruption that took place, about things that happened in the 2016 election in Ukraine or about \u2015 Q: But were you aware of others in the administration having those conversations? THE VICE PRESIDENT: \u2015 about the issue that former Vice President Biden had his son on the board of a major energy company in Ukraine at a time that Vice President Biden was running the United States\u2019 efforts in Ukraine.\u00a0 I think the American people have a right to know what was going on. And \u2015 but all of our discussions, all of my discussions with the leadership in Ukraine was entirely focused on President Trump\u2019s priority of supporting (inaudible) ... If Pence did know that Trump had pressed Ukraine\u2019s president to dig up dirt on Biden, that would mean he knew that Trump had potentially committed a federal crime and done nothing about it. It is illegal for anyone, including the president of the United States, to solicit anything of value from a foreign national that relates to a U.S. election. Federal Elections Chair Ellen Weintraub recently reiterated this point on Twitter. \u201cLet me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office,\u201d Weintraub said in a statement. \u201cIt is illegal for any person to solicit, accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a US election.\u201d Watch the video above to see Pence dodge the question about what he knew.",

      "content": " A video ad that falsely accuses Joe Biden of withholding $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to benefit his son has been viewed on Facebook millions of times since its release last month by President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. Biden, who\u2019s vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, has urged Facebook to take the ad down, arguing that it spreads \u201cobjectively false information\u201d and \u201cpoisons the public discourse.\u201d But Facebook, which has come under scrutiny for its role in spreading misinformation during the 2016 presidential election, has reportedly refused to pull the video, citing its \u201cfundamental belief in free expression\u201d and \u201crespect for the democratic process.\u201d The New York Times, which first reported Facebook\u2019s denial of Biden\u2019s request, reported Tuesday that the social media giant had sent a letter to the former vice president, saying the ad did not violate company policies. \u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,\u201d Katie Harbath, Facebook\u2019s head of global elections policy, said in the letter, per the Times. Harbath\u2019s letter echoed a similar sentiment expressed last month by Nick Clegg, a former U.K. deputy prime minister who is now a Facebook vice president, who said in a\u00a0speech\u00a0in Washington that it\u2019s not Facebook\u2019s \u201crole to intervene when politicians speak.\u201d The Biden campaign slammed Facebook\u2019s decision as \u201cunacceptable.\u201d The dissemination of \u201cobjectively false information to influence public opinion poisons the public discourse and chips away at our democracy,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo told CNN in a statement. \u201cWhether it originates from the Kremlin or Trump Tower, these lies and conspiracy theories threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections in America. It is unacceptable for any social media company to knowingly allow deliberately misleading material to corrupt its platform.\u201d The Trump ad being contested pushes a conspiracy theory that Biden \u2015 according to a narrator in the clip \u2015 \u201cpromised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company.\u201d While it is true that the elder Biden, then serving as vice president, told Ukrainian leaders in 2016\u00a0to fire a top prosecutor if they wanted to get the aid, there\u2019s no evidence that this demand had anything to do with his son, Hunter. The ad has also run on Twitter and YouTube, both told the Times that the ad complied with company policies. Biden\u2019s campaign told CNN that it \u201cwould not rule out sending similar letters\u201d to other social media sites requesting the ad\u2019s removal from their platforms. On TV, the ad has run on Fox News, which \u2014 like Facebook \u2014 denied a Biden campaign request to block the clip. CNN, however, has refused to run the ad. Explaining that decision, a CNN spokesman said last week that the video \u201cmakes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\u201d Facebook has come under fire from the Democratic National Committee, as well as other 2020 presidential hopefuls, for their refusal to block false statements or ads from political candidates. Democratic National Committee CEO Seema Nanda told CNN last week that Facebook was allowing Trump \u201cto mislead the American people on their platform unimpeded.\u201d On Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2015 who, along with Biden, is considered a front-runner\u00a0for the Democratic nomination for president \u2015 criticized Facebook\u2019s policies in a series of tweets. \u201cThe public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cFor instance, Trump and Zuckerberg met at the White House two weeks ago. What did they talk about?\u201d she added in a subsequent tweet. Warren suggested that Facebook had tweaked misinformation policies to exempt politicians from fact-checking after this meeting with Trump. As Reuters noted, Warren has not offered any evidence to support this claim. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication that Zuckerberg or Facebook executives have come to terms with the role their unpreparedness played\u201d in the spread of misinformation during the 2016 election, Warren wrote. \u201cNor have they shown that they understand what needs to be done to prevent another attack in the 2020 election.\u201d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A Democratic presidential race that had been largely static through the summer has tumbled into a chaotic fall, shaped by unpredictable events and the deepening impeachment crisis surrounding President Donald Trump. Less than four months before voting begins, front-running candidates are facing urgent questions about their ability to challenge Trump, prompted by a health scare for Sen. Bernie Sanders, an uneven response by Joe Biden to the president\u2019s efforts to tie him to the impeachment inquiry and nagging questions about liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2018s electability. Lower-tier candidates are struggling just to be heard. The uncertainty is heightening anxieties among Democrats desperate to defeat Trump in 2020. Although impeachment could imperil Trump\u2019s presidency, the process has also highlighted Trump\u2019s skill at discrediting his opponents, sometimes with baseless conspiracy theories. And Democrats appear no closer to sorting out what tactics, what ideology and what person is best-suited to overcome that. Progressive candidates like Sanders and Warren are surging in fundraising and drawing support from a wide swath of voters, according to polls, but face opposition from moderates who question whether now is the time to start the kind of sweeping \u2014 and divisive \u2014 economic and societal reforms they are pushing. It\u2019s a concern some moderates say has only increased against the backdrop of impeachment. \u201cThe divisions we have in the country threaten the health and stability of our democracy. President Trump has fractured so many norms,\u201d former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack said in an interview. \u201cLike a patient getting over an illness or injury, we have to first heal the nation\u2019s divisions and reestablish our norms before we have the needed strength to successfully embrace and implement an array of big ideas.\u201d Vilsack, a longtime friend of Biden\u2019s, has not endorsed anyone in the 2020 race. He\u2019s been courted by, and consulted with, numerous candidates, and has spoken regularly with Warren. The Massachusetts senator has energized voters with a menu of detailed policy proposals, a folksy, relatable way of explaining them and a swell of small-dollar donations that brought in more than $24.6 million in the most recent quarter. That\u2019s increasingly turning her into a target for candidates who see her calls for overhauling health care and rebalancing wealth in America as outside the mainstream. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is trying to break into the upper rung, has focused in particular on Warren\u2019s health care plan, the Sanders\u2019-authored \u201cMedicare for All\u201d single-payer system that Buttigieg describes as a \u201cmy-way-or-the-highway approach.\u201d But it\u2019s more than the policy Buttigieg is arguing against. \u201cWe have to be able not only to thrill a debate audience or a Twitter following but actually make something happen, which tells us that having the smartest policy is only half the battle when it comes to what will actually make a difference,\u201d Buttigieg said in an interview. For now, Warren advisers are happy to have Sanders still in the race to help absorb those blows rather than becoming the sole target of the attacks. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s good for Warren and Sanders to have each other in the race,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cThey bolster each other\u2019s ideas.\u201d The confidence Sanders\u2019 campaign felt last week after announcing a $25.3 million haul in the third quarter \u2014 the highest in the race \u2014 was lessened after the 78-year-old senator suffered a heart attack. He told reporters this week that he planned to scale back his campaign, then said he had misspoken. He\u2019ll return to the campaign on Tuesday for a debate in Ohio. His advisers privately acknowledge that the timing of the heart attack \u2014 which came just as the impeachment inquiry was escalating \u2014 may have helped limit the political fallout because attention was focused elsewhere. But they also understand that he will have to more directly address lingering health concerns. Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 chief strategist, dismissed any long-term concerns, noting that the 2020 contest includes several older candidates, including the 73-year-old Trump. \u201cThere are a number of older candidates in the race, including the sitting president of the United States, and I can tell you with confidence, there\u2019s only one we can say with assurance whose arteries are completely open,\u201d Weaver said, referencing the stent procedure designed to clear Sanders\u2019 clogged arteries. Biden, 76, stands as the strongest obstacle to Warren and Sanders, fundamentally opposed on policy and pitching a more conciliatory approach to governing. The former vice president was already facing questions about whether he was out of step with the party\u2019s activist liberal base and up for the challenge of taking on Trump before he got pulled into the impeachment inquiry, which centers on Trump\u2019s push for Ukraine to investigate the former vice president and his son. Although Trump\u2019s allegations against Biden are so far without foundation, the president and his allies have aggressively pressed the charges. Biden responded forcefully this week, but only after days of hand-wringing among supporters and advisers who worried he appeared ill-prepared for combatting the kind of asymmetrical political warfare at which Trump excels. Still, Biden backers contend that the mere fact that Trump has appeared focused on trying to take down Biden allows the former vice president to strengthen his electability argument by previewing what a one-on-one race with the president would look like. \u201cHe\u2019s able to go out there every day and make this Biden vs. Trump argument,\u201d said John Anzalone, a pollster for Biden. That\u2019s the fear for some lower-tier candidates \u2014 that the head-to-head fight between Trump and Biden, and the grassroots support of Warren and Sanders, block out their opportunities for a late surge. Everyone is at risk, including those who have had flashes of success in recent months but are now languishing in the single digits in many polls, including California Sen. Kamala Harris, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Buttigieg said there is no secret strategy for those candidates seeking to break out during this intense fall stride toward the first votes other than engaging in a \u201crespectful and robust\u201d debate of ideas. \u201cWhere there\u2019s an important difference, people need to understand that,\u201d he said.",

      "author": "Paul Blumenthal",
      "content": " On a snowy day in Manchester, New Hampshire, Democratic Maine Sen. Edmund Muskie, the front-runner for the party\u2019s 1972 presidential nomination, stood before the offices of the conservative Union Leader newspaper and denounced the paper\u2019s publisher William Loeb for publishing smears against him. \u201cBy attacking me, by attacking my wife, he has proved himself to be a gutless coward,\u201d Muskie said in an angry and emotional voice. Some reports claimed tears ran down his cheeks. Muskie, and many historians today, argued those tears were actually the steadily falling snow melting upon impact. But at the time, the reports that Muskie cried fueled a media narrative that he was mentally unstable. He won the New Hampshire primary by a smaller margin than anticipated and rapidly faded in the following contests. Forty-five years later, former vice president Joe Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, stood before a crowd in Las Vegas to give a very similar message as Muskie. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me,\u201d Biden declared on Oct. 2. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\u201d What was done to Muskie is precisely what is being done to Biden. The president of the United States orchestrated a secret campaign of smears and deceit meant to destroy the political opponent he perceived as the most threatening to his own reelection. For Muskie, that president was Richard Nixon. For Biden, it\u2019s Donald Trump. Muskie\u2019s downfall was part of a broad operation of illegality orchestrated by the Nixon White House to cover up leaks, spy on political opponents and fix the 1972 Democratic Party primary. It ultimately ended with Nixon\u2019s resignation and pardon. During his career as a California congressman, senator and failed gubernatorial candidate, Nixon was bedeviled by political tricks pulled on him by Democratic Party consultant Dick Tuck. Envious of the tricks deployed against him, Nixon decided to harness them himself. Ahead of the 1972 election, his campaign and the White House hired a host of characters to screw with his opponents in the Democratic Party. The ultimate goal was to get the party to nominate South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, an anti-war figure they believed to be the least electable. (They were right.) One of these characters was Donald Segretti, a University of Southern California frat boy, who was known for pulling political pranks to win student elections. Segretti and his buddies called these pranks \u201cratfucking.\u201d Segretti and his ratfuckers were given the task of sowing confusion among the Democratic Party presidential candidates Nixon feared the most: former vice president and 1968 presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey, Washington Sen. Henry \u201cScoop\u201d Jackson and Muskie. Among the many things Segretti and his team did to the Democratic Party presidential field was to forge letters from one campaign making wild allegations against another. They stole Muskie campaign letterhead and sent letters out alleging that sexual misconduct by Humphrey and that Jackson had fathered an illegitimate child with a 17-year-old girl. Muskie had to deny sending the letters while both Jackson and Humphrey were forced to deny the allegations. But what got Muskie up in front of the Union Leader on that snowy day in 1972 was something called the \u201cCanuck Letter.\u201d One of the tricks Segretti and his team pulled was to forge a letter to the editor that purported to be from a Florida man who had asked how Muskie could understand problems faced by African Americans since he represented Maine, a state with a very small African-American population. The letter claimed that Muskie laughed after a staffer said, \u201cNot blacks, but we have Canucks.\u201d At the time, \u201cCanuck\u201d was viewed as a derogatory term for French-Canadians, of which there were many living in New Hampshire. Segretti ended up pleading guilty to three counts of distributing fraudulent campaign material and served four months of his six-month prison sentence. Trump\u2019s attempt to tar Biden with the stench of a Ukrainian corruption investigation is just a grander prank aimed at rigging the 2020 election to his perceived benefit. In a now-infamous July 25 phone call, Trump pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a natural gas company that had Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden on its board. So far, Biden has not suffered in the polls since the controversy erupted after the whistleblower complaint accusing Trump of malfeasance was revealed in September. This is the only way that Trump knows how to do politics. He fanned the flames of birtherism against President Barack Obama, a racist dirty trick aimed at confusing both the public and the press. He latched on to every conspiracy theory imaginable about Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2015 she was dying, she sold uranium to Russia and so on. He publicly praised the Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee and called for, \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening,\u201d to hack some more. And now he\u2019s used the power of his office in an effort to manipulate a foreign country to manufacture a corruption investigation into the potential opponent he fears most. Trump learned these politics from two professional smear merchants. The first was Roy Cohn, the McCarthyite-turned-mob-lawyer with a speciality in character assassination. The second was Nixon\u2019s ultimate fanboy, Roger Stone. Cohn became Trump\u2019s first political adviser starting in the 1970s after the upcoming real estate developer and his father were facing charges of racial discrimination. Cohn taught Trump three key rules for dealing with challenges in business and politics, the author Sam Roberts told Vanity Fair\u2019s Maire Brenner: \u201c1. Never settle, never surrender. 2. Counter-attack, counter-sue immediately. 3. No matter what happens, no matter how deeply into the muck you get, claim victory and never admit defeat.\u201d Before dying of AIDS, Cohn passed off his Trump account to Stone, who had been loosely affiliated with Segretti\u2019s ratfuckers. Stone had pulled his share of dirty tricks as a Nixon hanger-on, including faking a donation from a made-up socialist group to Nixon\u2019s 1972 Republican primary opponent California Rep. Pete McCloskey. It was Stone who pushed Trump to think about a political career as early as 1987 and was one of three advisers who laid the groundwork for his 2016 campaign. The story of the Republican Party\u2019s resurgence in the second half of the 20th century often leapfrogs Nixon. The traditional tale is one of a \u201cremnant\u201d of activists and wealthy oligarchs holding tight through the New Deal. They helped Barry Goldwater, a true conservative ideologue, get the GOP presidential nod in 1964. Then Ronald Reagan, the former New Deal Democrat-turned-conservative reactionary, won their revolution in 1980. Nixon\u2019s transactional politics don\u2019t fit. But Nixon and his destructive politics are the real throughline from his 1972 landslide to Trump\u2019s presidency. The destruction of Muskie and the DNC break-in simply presaged Trump\u2019s use of the presidency to coerce a foreign country to intervene to help him win again \u2015 after a different country helped him the first time. The politics of personal destruction Nixon deployed ultimately destroyed him. But they\u2019ve fueled Trump\u2019s entire career and the party that elected him. As he heads toward his own impeachment, it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll heed Nixon\u2019s final message from the White House. \u201c[A]lways remember, others may hate you, but those who hate you don\u2019t win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself,\u201d Nixon said in his farewell statement.",

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Sunday denounced President Donald Trump\u2019s decision earlier this month to publicly urge China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary race. Asked during an interview Sunday with CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation\u201d whether he believes it\u2019s appropriate for Trump to ask China to open such a probe, Cruz stammered for a few moments before saying \u201cof course not.\u201d \u201cElections in the U.S. should be decided by Americans and it\u2019s not the business of foreign countries \u2015 any foreign countries \u2015 to be interfering in our elections,\u201d he said. Trump drew heated backlash from Democrats and some Republicans on Oct. 3 when he told reporters on the White House lawn that China \u201cshould start an investigation into the Bidens\u201d while discussing trade talks with the country. His comments echoed remarks he made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call in which he urged the foreign leader to look into Biden and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. The call became the subject of a subsequent whistleblower complaint filed by a U.S. intelligence official and later the centerpiece of the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump. Many of Trump\u2019s Republican defenders have claimed the president was only joking when he encouraged China to investigate the Bidens. But one of Trump\u2019s China advisers, Michael Pillsbury, told the Financial Times that he received \u201cquite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese\u201d following Trump\u2019s remarks. CBS\u2019 Margaret Brennan continued to press Cruz on Sunday, asking whether it had been appropriate for Trump to ask Ukraine to get involved. \u201cDo you think that, say, the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who\u2019s been talking about China, who\u2019s been talking about Ukraine, do you want to hear him testify about this sort of shadow foreign policy?\u201d she asked. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said last week that he wants Giuliani, who has been urging foreign officials to investigate the Bidens at the behest of Trump, to testify before his committee. \u201cListen, foreign countries should stay out of American elections,\u201d Cruz, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Brennan. \u201cThat\u2019s true for Russia, that\u2019s true for Ukraine, that\u2019s true for China \u2015 that\u2019s true for all of them. It should be the American people deciding elections.\u201d He added that it would \u201cmake a lot of sense\u201d for Giuliani to testify. Watch Cruz\u2019s full interview with \u201cFace The Nation\u201d below. His comments about Trump\u2019s request to the Chinese begin around the 4:30 mark.",

      "content": " A year after candidates of color flourished in Democratic primaries around the country during the midterm elections, the three leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination are all white, while Asian American, Black and Latino candidates are trapped in single digits in public polling. Heading into the fourth presidential debate in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, on Tuesday evening, three of the leading candidates of color find their campaigns in varying degrees of peril. Former San Antonio Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro has suggested he may drop out of the race if he fails to qualify for the fifth debate in Georgia next month. Sen. Cory Booker\u00a0(D-N.J.) just threatened to quit the contest unless he raised $1.7 million in 10 days. (He succeeded.) And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who briefly ascended to the race\u2019s top tier during the summer, is rejiggering her campaign with a focus on Iowa and a reworked stump speech. In 2018, the picture was much different, with Democratic voters across the country eager to cast history-making ballots. Black candidates won gubernatorial primaries in Florida, Georgia and Maryland, and Arizona Democrats nominated a Latino. Democrats elected the first two Native American women to Congress, the first two Muslim women, the first Latina to ever represent Texas, and sent Rep. Lauren Underwood, an African American, to Congress from a district that is 86% white. Overall, 216 candidates for House, Senate or governor were people of color in 2018, which included a 42% spike in the number of women of color running for those major offices. (The field for down-ballot contests in 2020 is still developing, but candidates of color could make similar gains this cycle.) Interviews with voters, campaigns, candidates and operatives nationally and in the early primary states indicate there is no single cause for the struggles of the candidates of color. Many of the factors keeping them behind the three leading candidates in polling also affect white candidates who have failed to break into the race\u2019s top tier. But the race\u2019s focus on electability, the structure of the early nominating contests and differences in how the media treat candidates of color compared with white candidates are making things even more difficult. Democratic voters, in poll after poll and conversation after conversation, have indicated their priority when selecting a nominee in 2020 is someone who can beat Donald Trump. There\u2019s plenty of reasons to think voters and pundits are bad at evaluating which candidates stand the best chance of defeating Trump, but that isn\u2019t stopping the conversation. \u201cThe conversation has been \u2018Hmm, I don\u2019t know if America is ready to elect a Black woman president of the United States,\u2019\u201d Harris told a crowd of about 50 at a block party in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a conversation, \u2019Oh, I can see it, but I don\u2019t know if my neighbors are ready. Maybe it\u2019s not her turn, maybe it\u2019s not her time, maybe it might be too hard. We got to play it safe. \u2026 Maybe we can\u2019t take that bet.\u2019\u201d The riff is a new one for Harris \u2015 she also mentions her undefeated record in elections and her work to persuade an Iowa caucus-goer about Barack Obama\u2019s electability in 2008 \u2015 and it shows how she still needs to convince a broad swath of the electorate that she can win. Booker, similarly, has argued that turning out younger and African American voters is as important as winning over the much-ballyhooed white working class when it comes to defeating Trump. Not everyone is convinced electability is what\u2019s holding back Booker, Harris and Castro. Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, which works to turn out Black voters, said Obama\u2019s wins in 2008 and 2012 had largely quieted concerns about whether race was a barrier to winning the country. And Warren, who faced more concerns than any other candidate about her ability to beat Trump in the first half of the year, has managed to persuade voters. But Ross Wilburn, an Iowa state representative who has endorsed Harris, said the constant barrage of news from Trump\u2019s White House and the president\u2019s willingness to engage in out-and-out racist rhetoric have made voters more cautious. \u201cBecause of what President Trump is doing, and the hate he spews, and the chaos that he\u2019s creating to divert our attention from illegal acts, people get cautious,\u201d he said after Harris\u2019 block party. \u201cThey want to go with the familiar. Part of her message is: \u2018We can believe. We\u2019ve believed before.\u2019\u201d The campaigns have also occasionally found themselves trapped in unfriendly media dynamics and dealing with a political press corps that still has a long way to go on the diversity front. Several operatives pointed to Castro\u2019s showdown with former Vice President Joe Biden at the most recent debate. The first person voters heard from after the debate ended? It was former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who served with Biden in the Obama administration and criticized Castro for challenging Biden. The post-debate pundits \u201coverwhelmingly tend to be older, white and more moderate or conservative voices, which is absolutely crazy in a primary with this many diverse candidates, where the diversity of our base is going to be what propels us to victory,\u201d said one operative working for a candidate of color, who requested anonymity to freely critique media coverage of the race. Indeed, a post-debate Univision poll found that 64% of Latino voters thought Castro\u2019s attack on Biden was fair. All the candidates of color have also faced another trap: They\u2019re expected to be both representatives of their race on the national stage while also appealing to the broader electorate. No small amount of coverage of businessman Andrew Yang\u2019s campaign has focused on how Asian American voters are reacting to his candidacy. Coverage of Castro has focused on his bold immigration policy. But if his campaign had released a more by-the-numbers plan, the media likely would\u2019ve zeroed in on that and questioned why he wasn\u2019t more aggressive. Similarly, much of the coverage of Harris and Booker has focused on their criminal justice reform plans and records. \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about it, it\u2019s \u2018why aren\u2019t you talking about this when it impacts people who look like you?\u2019 But if they do talk about it, it\u2019s \u2018She\u2019s just going to be the president of Black people,\u2019\u201d Shropshire noted, while praising the candidates for unveiling expansive platforms regardless. \u201cBut they\u2019ve done a good job managing it. None of these people are single-issue candidates.\u201d Harris and Booker have faced another problem. Both are running as candidates trying to find a sweet spot between progressives and moderates, neither embracing policies as liberal as those of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), nor bashing those policies and tacking to the center in the style of Biden. That means they\u2019re occasionally minimized or left out of stories about the race\u2019s central ongoing narrative: the ideological clash within the Democratic Party. \u201cThey just really haven\u2019t defined their base yet,\u201d Yvette Simpson, the president of the left-leaning group Democracy for America, said of Booker and Harris. \u201cBiden is sucking all the air out of the room for anyone who\u2019s not a pure progressive, while Sanders and Warren are winning over the votes of progressives.\u201d And generally the candidates\u2019 lower standings in the polls mean they get less media attention. Another operative working for the campaign of a candidate of color complained about struggling to get coverage of major policy rollouts and campaign speeches, \u201cwhile CNN and MSNBC cover Joe Biden eating an ice cream cone.\u201d Some of the challenges for Harris, Booker and Castro aren\u2019t totally dissimilar from those facing white candidates like former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) or Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Biden and Sanders, the 2016 runner-up who changed the Democratic Party, were always going to dominate media attention, early polling and fundraising. Warren\u2019s steady rise has ensured she\u2019s joined that group. Now the three top candidates are in a self-fulfilling cycle of sorts: They get more media coverage, money and strong poll results than anyone else, helping them get even more money and media attention, which helps them keep their strong position in the polls. Breaking into this virtuous cycle has proved difficult for most of the candidates, except for Warren, Buttigieg and \u2015 for a time over the summer \u2015 Harris. \u201cThere\u2019s the idea of electability, and there\u2019s the idea of anoint-ability,\u201d said the second operative working for a candidate of color. \u201cThe media, the [Democratic National Committee], the benchmarks they set, the white candidates were always going to be able to meet them. It\u2019s been a lot harder for candidates of color.\u201d But the early-state voting order \u2015 Iowa, which is the nation\u2019s fifth-whitest state, votes first; and New Hampshire, the nation\u2019s third-whitest state, votes second \u2015 is part of the problem. Much of the public polling, which influences donors, voters and who makes the debate stage, is focused on these two states. During the time period to qualify via polling for the third debate, only one public poll of Nevada, the most diverse of the four early-voting states, was released. Still, it\u2019s not unprecedented for Black candidates to triumph in either state. Obama won the 2008 Iowa caucus, and Deidre DeJear \u2015 now Harris\u2019 Iowa campaign chair \u2015 won an upset victory to become the Democratic nominee for secretary of state in 2018. So far, the lack of a candidate of the color in the top tier has bewildered some Democratic operatives and left some worried about generating sufficient Black and Latino turnout in order to win the nomination. But there is still time for the candidates of color to sprint to the nomination race\u2019s upper ranks. More voters may tune into the race as voting nears, and Tuesday night\u2019s debate stage provides them with another high-profile opportunity. And if Harris or Booker, in particular, manage to break through, there could be immense political rewards. Black voters in South Carolina and in delegate-rich Super Tuesday states, several operatives noted, may flock to support a viable Black candidate. \u201cAfrican Americans and voters of color tend to wait until they\u2019re sure you can win,\u201d said Simpson. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a Catch-22 for these candidates.\u201d And even if the candidates fail to win, they can still point to personal and historical progress. Castro, little-known nationally before this race, has emerged as a favorite of progressives for his willingness to push the envelope on policy and sharply challenge more moderate Democrats. Few Democratic operatives give the unorthodox campaign of Yang much chance of success, but he\u2019s managed to popularize the idea of a universal basic income and created a mini-movement at his back. \u201cWhen I began my career a decade ago, it was unimaginable we might one day have two Black candidates for president,\u201d said Rosy Gonzalez Speers, the executive director of Forward Florida. \u201cI\u2019m excited for our party. It\u2019s only October, and there\u2019s a lot of race left to run, so I wouldn\u2019t count any candidates out yet.\u201d Amanda Terkel contributed reporting.",

      "author": "Sanjana Karanth",
      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden told LGBTQ rights figure Judy Shepard on Thursday that passing the Equality Act would come \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d if he won the presidency in 2020. Shepard, whose son Matthew Shepard was murdered in 1998 for being gay, asked Biden at CNN\u2019s LGBTQ town hall\u00a0in Los Angeles how the former senator and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate would reduce hate crimes against LGBTQ people and other marginalized communities. Biden stressed the importance of passing the Equality Act, which cleared the House earlier this year. It would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to also ban discrimination \u201con the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes.\u201d The bill\u2019s goal is to provide anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people in areas such as places of employment on a national level. \u201cThat\u2019s important,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s important because it\u2019ll change a whole range of things.\u201d Matthew Shepard was a 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming when he was killed, and his death became one of the country\u2019s most high-profile hate crimes against LGBTQ people. Judy Shepard and her husband, Dennis, founded the Matthew Shepard Foundation, an LGBTQ nonprofit that runs education and advocacy programs. Biden also said that his administration would track down hate groups and that he believes the correct interpretation of the Civil Rights Act includes LGBTQ people. \u201cThis is a civil rights issue. It\u2019s covered by, in my view \u2015 the court may not agree \u2015 this is a civil rights issue protected by the Civil Rights Act,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we should be focusing on how to enforce that. My Justice Department \u2015 and I guess any one of the Democrats\u2019 Justice Department \u2015 will, in fact, do that.\u201d The Supreme Court is currently divided on\u00a0whether the Civil Rights Act, or Title VII, protects LGBTQ people from employment discrimination. A key part of the law bans job discrimination based on sex, though some courts in recent years have read the language to include discrimination against LGBTQ people as part of sex discrimination. Biden\u2019s answers to Judy Shepard\u2019s question were applauded, though the presidential candidate later caused a bit of discomfort in the audience after describing his first public statement supporting same-sex marriage in 2012 as when he \u201ccame out.\u201d \u201cFor example, when I came out and ... ,\u201d Biden said before catching himself and restarting with: \u201cWhen I publicly stated.\u201d \u201cComing out\u201d is a term often used to describe when someone chooses to publicly identify as LGBTQ. CNN hosted the town hall with the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ nonprofit organization.",

The former vice president made the comments to CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, who was moderating the Los Angeles town hall event, a forum for nine Democratic presidential candidates to discuss LGBTQ issues. After going on a tangent about stereotypes surrounding gay people, Biden concluded with a reflection on how the discourse about homosexuality had changed in recent years, compared with about two decades ago: \u201cRemember, Anderson? Back 15, 20 years ago, when we talked about this in San Francisco, it was all about,\u00a0well, gay bathhouses.\u00a0It was all about round-the-clock sex.\u00a0Come on, man.\u00a0Gay couples are more likely to stay together longer than heterosexual couples,\u201d he said. On a more serious note, Biden also discussed curtailing foreign assistance to countries who discriminate against LGBTQ citizens, the importance of passing the Equality Act in order to reduce hate crimes and protecting transgender people\u2019s right to join the military. At one point, he referenced a time when he \u201ccame out\u201d but rolled with the joke and walked across the stage to put his arm around Cooper, who is gay. \u201cWell, that would be news,\u201d Cooper joked back. \u201cI kind of figured it out a while ago.\u201d People on Twitter were very confused by, well, all of it. Although, there was one resounding thing viewers could agree with that they wanted out of this: A remix of \u201cgay, gay, gay bathhouses.\u201d It was quickly delivered:",

      "author": "S.V. Date",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Look up \u201ccorrupt\u201d in the dictionary and you could expect to find an illustration of Donald Trump looking right back \u2015 yet that has not kept the president from repeatedly calling others corrupt in recent weeks. Trump has given his daughter and son-in-law prominent White House jobs, steers lobbyists and political groups seeking his favor toward using his Pennsylvania Avenue hotel, and even successfully pushed the U.S. government to host the next G-7 meeting\u00a0at his own golf resort, which will put tens of millions of American tax dollars into his own cash registers next June. \u201cHe has no shame,\u201d said Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman who is running against Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. \u201cHe\u2019s incapable of shame. That\u2019s not normal.\u201d Indeed, such actions, had they been taken by a mayor, a county executive or a governor, would in all likelihood result in state or federal public corruption charges. While laws and rules vary by state and locality, ethics laws generally prohibit public officials from profiting from their offices. Giving oneself a large government contract \u2015 as Trump\u2019s White House announced Thursday with the selection of his troubled Doral, Florida, golf course as the site of the next summit of the world\u2019s largest democratic economies \u2015 would almost certainly result in a criminal prosecution, ethics experts said. \u201cThis is a president who believes the powers of the presidency are bestowed on him to advance his own personal interests, political and profit-seeking, rather than those of the American people,\u201d said Robert Weissman, president of the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen. But as the sitting president, Trump is immune from both ethics laws and criminal prosecution, and not only has he openly engaged in nepotism and self-dealing, he has, in recent weeks, started accusing political opponents and the news media of \u201ccorruption.\u201d At an Oct. 2 news conference, for example, he called former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter \u201cstone, cold corrupt.\u201d At an Oct. 11 rally in Lake Charles, Louisiana, he broadened that to all Democrats: \u201cThe radical Democrats\u2019 policies are crazy. Their politicians are corrupt.\u201d In an Oct. 14 statement he posted on Twitter, Trump called The New York Times corrupt. Just two days later, during a photo opportunity with the visiting president of Italy, he called his predecessor Barack Obama corrupt, as well as the entire 2016 election. Others Trump has labeled \u201ccorrupt\u201d in recent weeks: former FBI director James Comey, former FBI agent Peter Strzok, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, the entire Mueller investigation into the help Russia gave Trump in winning the 2016 election, all of the news media, California Democratic congressman Adam Schiff and CNN. To Trump critics, the president\u2019s attacks are part of a predictable pattern: Accuse others of the inappropriate behavior that he himself engages in. Bandy Lee, among a group of mental health professionals who have been warning of Trump\u2019s state of mind for years, said Trump is exhibiting typical behavior for a \u201cparanoid, delusional\u201d leader. \u201cHe accuses others exactly of what he is responsible for,\u201d said Lee, a Yale Medical School professor of psychiatry. \u201cIt is a psychological defense called \u2018projection.\u2019\u201d Josh Schwerin, a former spokesman for 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, recalled Trump\u2019s response when Clinton accused Trump of behaving like Russian dictator Vladimir Putin\u2019s puppet. \u201cNo puppet. No puppet. You\u2019re the puppet,\u201d Trump replied at the third and final presidential debate. \u201cHe accuses other people of doing the bad things he\u2019s doing,\u201d Schwerin said. \u201cHe is the most corrupt president in modern times,\u201d said Jennifer Horn, a former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party. \u201cHe has to convince his followers that everyone is corrupt so they will ignore his corruption.\u201d The White House did not respond to HuffPost queries regarding Trump\u2019s self-dealing and nepotism. One top Republican National Committee member, though, said he is not bothered by any of Trump\u2019s behavior, and instead attacked the news media for not reporting sufficiently on the Clinton Foundation, Hunter Biden or the money former Obama has made since leaving office. \u201cA few dollars on his hotels, which are actually a legitimate business, I\u2019m not going to lose much sleep over,\u201d said Shawn Steel, a longtime RNC member from California, urging more scrutiny of Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Damaging Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 candidacy was a key objective of Trump\u2019s newfound interest in rooting out \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine, according to a top Trump adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. Trump believes Biden would be his strongest opponent and has sought to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate a conspiracy theory that Ukrainian officials seeking to help Hillary Clinton win the 2016 election planted false evidence to make it appear that Russia had helped Trump. According to that conspiracy theory, which also manages to tie in the Bidens and Hungarian billionaire George Soros and the framing of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the hacked Democratic National Committee server and Clinton\u2019s 33,000 deleted emails have been hidden away somewhere in Ukraine. Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, has called the claim \u201ccompletely debunked\u201d and warned that Trump\u2019s obsession with it would be the \u201cwhite whale\u201d that could bring him down. Indeed, it was Trump\u2019s request of Ukraine\u2019s president in a July 25 phone call to investigate both the Bidens and the 2016 election conspiracy that sparked a whistleblower complaint against Trump, which in turn led to the ongoing impeachment inquiry. White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted Thursday that those considerations played into Trump\u2019s policy toward Ukraine. \u201cGet over it: There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d he said. Kendal Unruh, a former GOP activist from Colorado who led the unsuccessful effort to dump Trump at the 2016 party convention, said it was distressing to see Republicans tolerating the president\u2019s actions. \u201cThe Republican Party has become completely corrupted to the core in their habitual defense of Trump\u2019s behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to watch the death of a party that once actually stood for morality and the rule of law.\u201d Yet Yale psychiatrist Lee said increasing pressure on Trump with the threat of impeachment will create a far greater danger to the country than the mere diminishment of a political party. \u201cHis emotional drive to project all his own corruption and ineptitude onto others will overwhelm any ability on the part of others to correct or redirect his lies,\u201d she said. \u201cThis drive will become more severe with greater pressure and, paradoxically, the sicker he is, the more effective his pathology will be in overcoming any resistance, starting with himself.\u201d",

Thanks for following along, and be sure to check out even more coverage on HuffPost. \u2015 Paige Lavender 11:02 p.m. ET Also missing tonight: Questions on immigration. \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 10:54 p.m. ET Sanders and Castro both mentioned homelessness of their own accord,\u00a0but there were no questions tonight about affordable housing. The lack of affordable housing is a nationwide crisis. On a given day in January 2018, more than 500,000 people were homeless in the U.S. Trump went on a tear last month about homelessness in California, which has one of the highest rates of homelessness in the U.S., and complained about how people living in tents were ruining the \u201cprestige\u201d of San Francisco and Los Angeles. \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 10:53 p.m. ET Klobuchar says her most surprising friendship was with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, whom she says she misses \u201cevery day.\u201d She shares a quote from him: \u201cThere is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.\u201d \u2015 Nina Golgowski 10:50 p.m. ET Castro says he agrees with Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 message of practicing kindness but that he also believes we should hold people accountable for what they have done. \u201cI think we can do both things,\u201d he says. \u2015 Nina Golgowski 10:47 p.m. ET The final question of the night is about... Ellen DeGeneres? She caused a stir last week after being spotted palling around with former President George W. Bush at an NFL game. She was criticized for joking with Bush, and then fiercely defended her friendship with him on her show. Despite the cultural relevance, it feels like a weird question to end a debate that had zero questions about climate change. \u2015 Paige Lavender 10:44 p.m. ET Biden accuses Warren of pursuing vague ideas. Warren responds by touting the Obama administration\u2019s push for the consumer protection agency she recommended. \u201cI convinced people to vote for it,\u201d Biden says to Warren, who then thanks Barack Obama. Biden interjects, telling Warren she did a \u201chell of a job at your job.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren replies \u2015 coolly. \u2015 Ja\u2019han Jones 10:42 p.m. ET Warren and Sanders make the pitch for their \u201cbold\u201d policy plans over more centrist reform policies.

Yang goes a step further, arguing safe injection sites should be open around the country and opioid addicts should be referred to counseling and rehab instead of prison. He also repeats an argument he\u2019s made before that opiates should be decriminalized for personal use. \u2015 Paige Lavender 9:48 p.m. ET Klobuchar says the people who should pay for treatment for those affected by the opioid epidemic are the people \u201cwho got them hooked and killed in the first place.\u201d \u2015 Nina Golgowski 9:46 p.m. ET Castro brings Atatiana Jefferson into the gun violence debate, saying, \u201cPolice violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.\u201d Read more about the officer, who has been charged with murder. \u2015\u00a0Sara Boboltz 9:44 p.m. ET Booker and Harris assume roles they\u2019ve assumed in previous debates, speaking \u2015 solitarily \u2015 about gun violence as it relates to Black communities, which experience gun death disproportionately. \u201cThe leading cause of death of young Black men in America is gun violence,\u201d Harris says. \u2015 Ja\u2019han Jones 9:41 p.m. ET Booker, Buttigieg and O\u2019Rourke go at it again on gun control, with O\u2019Rourke arguing for a mandatory assault weapons buyback and Buttigieg responding to O\u2019Rourke: \u201cI do not need lessons from you on courage \u2015 political or personal.\u201d Booker jumps in to mention the issue of everyday gun violence.

Buttigieg, who served in the military, says when he was deployed, one of the things \u201ckeeping me safe\u201d was that the U.S. flag on his uniform was trusted.

(She plans to introduce a wealth tax.) \u201cThe really, really billionaires are making money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing. ... I think that as democrats we will succeed when we dream big and fight hard.\u201d Klobuchar has harsh words for Warren in response, slamming her rival\u2019s progressive, detailed policies. \u201cI think simply because you have big ideas doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re fighting for regular people,\u201d Klobuchar says. \u2015 Sara Boboltz 8:59 p.m. ET Harris touts her proposed tax credits for lower-income Americans as a solution to poverty and income inequality.

He also makes the first mention of homelessness on stage tonight, lamenting the \u201chalf a million Americans sleeping out on the street today.\u201d Steyer then chuckles when the moderator points out he\u2019s the only billionaire on the stage. \u201cThere have been 40 years when corporations have bought this government,\u201d Steyer says. \u201cThe results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says. It\u2019s absolutely wrong, and it\u2019s absolutely undemocratic and unfair.\u201d He then touts his wealth tax. Warren jumps in. \u201cWhy does everyone on this stage think it\u2019s more important to protect billionaires than to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d she asks. \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman and Sara Boboltz 8:48 p.m. ET General Motors, whose workers are currently striking in the biggest auto industry work stoppage in decades, prompts a discussion about unions and living wages.

The overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills.\u201d He also adds that \u201cit is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.\u201d \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 8:27 p.m. ET Buttigieg, taking his first swipe at Warren over her support for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d says the senator has a plan for everything except how to pay for her health care bill. \u2015 Ja\u2019han Jones 8:26 p.m. ET Asked to clarify whether her health care plan will raise taxes for the middle class, Warren says she won\u2019t sign a bill into law \u201cthat does not lower costs for middle-class families.\u201d \u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy and big corporations; for hardworking middle-class families costs will go down,\u201d she says. \u2015 Paige Lavender 8:23 p.m. ET Biden answers a question on his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings with Ukraine while Biden was vice president.

      "content": " Presidential candidate Joe Biden said Sunday that no family member of his would have an office in the White House or act as a diplomat under his potential administration. The Democrat\u2019s comments at a United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) forum in Iowa were in response to an NBC reporter\u2019s question of what kind of ethical guidelines Biden would create if elected president. The reporter referenced the candidate\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, whose business dealings in China and Ukraine have been at the center of President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to investigate unsubstantiated allegations of corruption\u00a0against the Bidens. \u201cNo one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in meetings as if they are a cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country,\u201d the former vice president told reporters. \u201cPeriod. End of story.\u201d Biden appeared to be drawing a contrast with Trump\u2019s children, some of whom have been involved either as senior advisers in the White House or as\u00a0diplomats with foreign nations. The Democrat\u2019s remarks came just hours after his son Hunter Biden announced his planned resignation\u00a0from the board of a Chinese-backed private equity firm. Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney, George Mesires, released a statement earlier Sunday\u00a0that said the younger Biden intends to resign from the board of directors of BHR Partners by Oct. 31. The statement also said Hunter Biden promises to avoid conflicts of interest if his father is elected president, and will continue to keep the former vice president out of his business affairs. At the forum, Joe Biden continued to stress that he has not discussed his son\u2019s business affairs with him, adding that he was not aware of what was in Mesires\u2019 statement until he read it upon release. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not going to let you all do is let you take the focus off the problem,\u201d Biden told reporters at the UFCW forum. \u201cNo one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong. No one has asserted that I\u2019ve done anything wrong except the lying president. That\u2019s the only thing. That\u2019s the focus.\u201d Hunter Biden had served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings when Joe Biden was vice president, and stepped down from the position in April. The younger Biden\u2019s attorney has maintained that no law enforcement agency has ever accused his client of wrongdoing during his time on the board. In a July phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s work in the country while his father, now one of Trump\u2019s political rivals, was vice president. Trump\u2019s phone call, and his request that a foreign government interfere in the 2020 U.S. election, is part of what sparked the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into the president for abusing the power of his office to benefit his reelection campaign. Trump has repeatedly defended his actions and denied any wrongdoing, saying that the call was \u201cperfect.\u201d Biden announced last week that he believes Trump should be impeached. He was one of the last 2020 Democrats to say so.",

      "content": " Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, denied doing anything \u201cimproper\u201d in his work with Ukrainian and Chinese companies as President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence. Biden told ABC News, in an interview that aired on Tuesday, that he never made a mistake \u201cbased on some ethical lapse,\u201d but acknowledged he exercised \u201cpoor judgment\u201d by getting involved in something he compared to a \u201cswamp.\u201d Hunter Biden on Sunday announced he was stepping down from his position as a director for Chinese investment company BHR Partners as Trump continues to accuse him and his father of corrupt activity in Ukraine and China. Trump has urged foreign leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Chinese government, to investigate Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, his potential Democratic rival in the 2020 election. House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into the president after a whistleblower complaint alleged he repeatedly pressured Zelensky and may have withheld U.S. military aid as leverage. Trump claims Joe Biden, as vice president, called for the removal of a notoriously corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine for the purpose of impeding an investigation into Burisma, a Ukranian gas company where Hunter Biden served on the board of directors. There\u2019s no evidence Joe Biden or Hunter Biden did anything illegal. Hunter Biden told ABC News repeatedly that he never discussed his business dealings in Ukraine and China with his father. Hunter Biden acknowledged that his last name helped him professionally, and that he likely wouldn\u2019t have been asked to serve on Burisma\u2019s board had he not been the vice president\u2019s son. \u201cIn retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part,\u201d he told ABC News of his foreign business deals. \u201cWhen I look back on it, I know that [I] did nothing wrong at all. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is ... a swamp in many ways? Yeah.\u201d He denied Trump\u2019s claim that he raked in $1.5 billion from an investment deal in China, saying it has \u201cno basis in fact in any way.\u201d In recent weeks, Trump has gone after Hunter Biden during his political rallies and in appearances to reporters, bashing him for avoiding the media while his business dealings have been thrust into the national spotlight. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d Trump tweeted several times over the last week. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Hunter Biden told ABC News. \u201cI\u2019m working and living my life.\u201d Biden said he made a \u201cmistake\u201d in giving a \u201chook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father,\u201d an apparent reference to Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s push for foreign leaders to investigate his family. \u201cDid I do anything improper?\u201d Hunter Biden added. \u201cNo, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\u201d Watch ABC\u2019s interview with Hunter Biden below:",
