      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) beat out Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for the endorsement of the Working Families Party, one of the country\u2019s most influential progressive organizations. The decision came down to three main factors,\u00a0according to six people who participated in the WFP\u2019s endorsement process:\u00a0her more aggressive outreach to key decision-makers, her strong commitment to racial and gender equity, and the perception that she has broader national appeal. Warren \u201chas a long track record of working with our folks on issues from the foreclosure crisis to the sale of homes to Wall Street,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, the executive director of the low-income activist group New York Communities for Change and one of two people who cast votes for Warren on behalf of the New York WFP state committee. \u201cA lot of it stems from how she has run her campaign. From the beginning, she centered racial inequality in her campaign. She went to Jackson, Mississippi, and talked to these issues head on. It was not an addendum.\u201d Since announcing its endorsement of Warren on Monday, the Working Families Party has been bombarded with complaints from Sanders supporters questioning whether the outcome of the vote reflected the views of WFP leaders \u2014 who they suspect put Warren over the top \u2014 or the group\u2019s more numerous dues-paying members and supporters. The votes of the former were represented by 56 delegates on the WFP\u2019s national committee, including Westin, and were weighted to make up half of the total endorsement vote. An estimated 10,000 of WFP\u2019s dues-paying members and other progressive activists who participated in the online ballot made up the other half. HuffPost spoke with Westin and five other WFP state and regional leaders whose votes in state-level plebiscites determined the way their national committee delegates voted. The goal of HuffPost\u2019s inquiry was not to assess the fairness of WFP\u2019s endorsement process, but to get a sense of why many delegates chose Warren. In addition to Westin, HuffPost spoke with Andrea Serrano, executive director of the Albuquerque, New Mexico, nonprofit Ol\u00e9; Stephanie Zucker, a WFP activist from near Morgantown, West Virginia; and three other New Yorkers: education activist Billy Easton, organized labor official Sandra Cuellar Oxford and fair housing advocate David Schwartz. Easton, Oxford and Schwartz cast votes that bound New York\u2019s delegates to Warren; Zucker and her fellow West Virginia WFP committee members voted to have their national delegates endorse Warren as well. Serrano would not say how the New Mexico WFP affiliate voted, but described what people who participated in the process found attractive in Warren\u2019s candidacy. As with the four other candidates the WFP considered endorsing, Sanders sat for a public, live-streamed endorsement interview, where he was questioned by WFP national organizing director Nelini Stamp and WFP activists. But Sanders did not participate in a later video conference call with WFP national delegates and members of the WFP\u2019s state committees.\u00a0On that call, presidential candidates could make their case for an endorsement directly to the people with a say in the matter. Warren and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro availed themselves of the opportunity; Sanders did not. \u201cIt was an opportunity for Bernie and his people to make their pitch. It\u2019s a lost opportunity,\u201d said Oxford, a WFP leader in upstate New York. Sanders\u2019 absence did not sway Oxford per se, who cited other reasons for her vote for Warren. But for other WFP leaders, it reflected Warren\u2019s greater affinity for the political art of courting allies, an activity that critics and supporters alike say Sanders has been less invested in over the course of his career. \u201cThis is the thing about Warren, you see it in her selfie lines: She\u2019ll put in all of the work to try and connect with a voter, to try and secure an endorsement \u2015 like she was trying to do in the WFP process \u2015 and to make her case,\u201d said Westin, who voted for Sanders in the WFP\u2019s endorsement process for the 2016 election cycle. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s actually a quality that we need in terms of somebody who is going to beat Trump.\u201d Prior to the endorsement process, Warren had likewise exhibited a knack for politicking that was unmatched by Sanders. A week before the WFP revealed the results of its endorsement process, she endorsed Kendra Brooks, a WFP candidate for one of two at-large Philadelphia city council seats that are effectively reserved for non-Democrats, and currently occupied by Republicans. Warren also endorsed Stephen Smith, the WFP-backed progressive running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in West Virginia. Sanders, whose political director Analilia Mejia previously ran the New Jersey Working Families Party, could have one-upped Warren by endorsing both Brooks and Nicolas O\u2019Rourke, the second WFP candidate for Philadelphia city council. Instead, he endorsed neither of them. \u201cSupporting progressive Black and other women of color for office is always a positive thing,\u201d Serrano said. The Sanders campaign did not immediately provide an explanation for Sanders\u2019 decisions not to participate in the video conference call, or endorse in the Philadelphia city council races. Sanders has worked hard to dispel the perception, formed during his 2016 presidential run, that he is insufficiently committed to addressing injustices like racism and sexism on their own terms, rather than strictly as manifestations of economic inequality. He hired a more diverse contingent of senior campaign staff; featured race more prominently in his stump speech; took pains to court influential Black leaders in early primary states like South Carolina; and produced, among other things, a far-reaching criminal justice reform platform that seeks to redress racist practices. But several of the WFP leaders who spoke to HuffPost still consider Warren to be more genuinely committed to combating racial inequity, in particular, as a form of injustice that must be addressed independent of structural economic problems. Warren\u2019s remarks in Detroit in July about countering the effects of historic housing discrimination in Black neighborhoods stood out to Easton, who runs the Alliance for Quality Education in Albany, New York,\u00a0and considers racial justice the most important issue in the race. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a white candidate for major office be crystal clear and direct and so effective, breaking down the concept in a way people can understand,\u201d he said. Serrano argued that, by contrast, Sanders\u2019 attempts to broaden his message outward from the economy had been inadequate. \u201cIt is not OK to separate class from race and gender \u2026 People have tried to say, \u2018Do better on this subject,\u2019 and it just doesn\u2019t seem to last,\u201d she said. Conversely, some of the WFP stakeholders cited Warren\u2019s identification as a capitalist seeking to put a check on the economic system\u2019s most oppressive features, rather than replace it, as both more in line with their own thinking, and evidence of her broader national appeal. Zucker, who is a part owner of her family\u2019s veterinary hospital, described Warren\u2019s vision as \u201ccapitalism with a conscience\u201d and said she shares that view. \u201cI\u2019m fully in support of [Sanders\u2019] policies in the vast majority of areas. But I think Elizabeth Warren is doing a better job of communicating what I believe is their shared vision of a just economy.\u201d Others spoke more generally about what they see as Warren\u2019s success expanding beyond a core group of left-wing supporters. \u201cI really feel that Elizabeth Warren would have a better shot at unifying the left and the center. We can\u2019t just think we\u2019re going to go as far left as we can and bring the center along with us,\u201d Oxford said. \u201cI feel that Elizabeth has been somewhat more conciliatory and offered a larger tent to those who definitely won\u2019t vote for Bernie.\u201d Sanders supporters point to polling that has shown higher levels of support\u00a0for Sanders than Warren among working-class voters and, until recently, Black voters, as evidence that he is better equipped to build a winning, national coalition. But Warren\u2019s supporters in the WFP believe that her base of support will continue to diversify as more Americans pay attention to the primary race. \u201cMy membership is low-income people of color and my membership absolutely loves Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Westin said. \u201c[Former vice president] Joe Biden and Bernie have been big names for years. People are just tuning into the race.\u201d Given the complexity of the WFP\u2019s endorsement process, it is not surprising that it has generated some skepticism. Sanders partisans \u2014 acting with some encouragement from the Sanders campaign \u2014 have urged the WFP to release a breakdown of the vote that would show whether Warren won the endorsement thanks to the national delegates or had enough support to win among the dues-paying members and associated activists who voted. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they want to release it?\u201d wrote Matt Bruenig, a founder of the People\u2019s Policy Project, a left-wing think tank. \u201cYou hate to speculate about such things, but the only answer is because the member votes went for Sanders while the leadership votes went for Warren, and the organization is embarrassed to reveal the degree to which the leadership overruled the membership.\u201d The WFP says it is refusing to release the figures because to do so would create an artificial division in the status of different voters, when all of the votes cast are equally legitimate. In some cases, the distinctions might be hazy anyway. Schwartz, Zucker and Easton all voted in the online general membership ballot in addition to casting their state committee votes. More broadly, the WFP defends its practice of granting its most committed activists and partner organizations an outsize say in its endorsement, particularly given the grassroots constituencies they each represent. By contrast, an assortment of sympathetic progressives who were not previously involved in WFP were free to participate in the larger membership vote if they affirmed the WFP\u2019s values through the completion of an online form by Sept. 6. Some Sanders supporters mobilized people to participate on Reddit. And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee leveraged its considerable email list to encourage its activists to cast votes for Warren. The WFP also noted that in the 2016 endorsement process, the votes of national delegates were weighted to make up 87.5% of the total vote share \u2015 far more than in the 2020 endorsement process. Those national delegates represented a group of WFP stakeholders that was less diverse and more conservative, including a number of labor unions that departed the organization in 2018 in protest of its endorsement of Cynthia Nixon\u2019s candidacy\u00a0for New York governor. The WFP only ended up endorsing Sanders in the 2016 election cycle, over many of those stakeholders\u2019 protestations, because 87% of the dues-paying members and other activists \u2014 who got the remaining one-eighth of the vote not held by national leaders \u2014 backed Sanders. Part of Bruenig\u2019s argument for the WFP to release the breakdown of its vote, is precisely that the organization released a breakdown of Sanders\u2019 share of the non-leadership vote when it announced its endorsement in Dec. 2015. But the WFP released the figure in the 2016 election cycle as a show of force for Sanders amid deep skepticism from within the WFP\u2019s national stakeholders. The fury expressed by many Sanders supporters toward the WFP endorsement reflects the realization of socialists who got involved in politics thanks to Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign that they are not as closely aligned with the national WFP as they previously thought. In New York City in particular, members of the Democratic Socialists of America have worked closely with the WFP. New York City DSA, which endorsed Nixon at the WFP\u2019s urging over the objections of many of its members, provided an essential army of door knockers for her ultimately unsuccessful campaign. But while there is considerable overlap, DSA members are more uniformly socialist in their political outlook than the average WFP activist. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is the most conservative presidential contender for whom they are willing to consider mobilizing their membership to support. For example, Sanders has been far more consistent and emphatic than Warren in his support for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which is perhaps the single highest policy priority of DSA members. \u201cThe split is between people who came into politics long before 2016 and have been doing progressive politics as a profession for a long time, and the movement that was sparked by the Sanders campaign,\u201d said Michael Kinnucan, a member of the NYC DSA. \u201cHis campaign got thousands of people involved in American politics at the rank-and-file level, in DSA and elsewhere, and that movement has begun to reshape American politics. Those folks do feel betrayed that the power and potential of that movement is not recognized by some people in the Working Families Party.\u201d",

      "content": " For the third time in a row, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren pulled off a well-received debate performance, new polling finds. More broadly, the state of the 2020 campaign appears to remain much where it\u2019s stood since August: Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead in the horse race polls, trailed by Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. A few other metrics suggest Warren may be positioned for further growth. And most primary voters remain very far from locked into a decision, meaning there\u2019s plenty of room for things to change. Thirty-seven percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters who saw at least clips of the debate last Thursday said they came away with an improved view of Warren, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, while just 9% said their opinions of her worsened. That\u2019s not as dramatic as her reception in the first and second debates, when half or more reported improved views, but it\u2019s still enough to place her ahead of her rivals this round. Three other candidates also saw their positive ratings for the debates significantly outstrip their negatives: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (31% had an improved view of him compared to 11% whose view worsened); former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (30% improved to 13% worsened) and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (26% improved to 11% worsened). Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2015 who aggressively challenged Biden onstage \u2015 saw the worst numbers (15% improved compared to 41% worsened), with the remaining candidates breaking more or less close to even. The standard\u00a0provisos about debate polling\u00a0remain\u00a0relevant here: Voters\u2019 preexisting opinions of the candidates help to shape their reactions; opinions remain fluid; and, of course, impressing voters in a debate doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into gaining even temporary ground in the horse race. Plenty of voters, as FiveThirtyEight notes, didn\u2019t even watch the debate. In the HuffPost/YouGov survey, only about 55% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters said they caught even clips of the event. Perhaps the clearest example of the debates affecting this race so far has been California Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 brief surge following a strong initial performance, and her subsequent fall from the top tier of polling when she failed to match it in subsequent debates. By contrast, Sanders\u2019 poll numbers have remained basically stable since summer, while Warren\u2019s rise has appeared gradual and largely untethered to any specific incident. \u201cWe\u2019re practically raised to believe that debates impact election results in big ways. Millions watch, candidates spend countless hours preparing, media can\u2019t stop talking, and writing, about them.\u00a0And, after all, we\u2019re taught debates are the way we should be making voting decisions.\u00a0They\u2019ve just got to be game-changers,\u201d Democratic pollster Mark Mellman wrote. \u201cBut they\u2019re not ... Voters in the early states will get lots more direct exposure to the candidates through other mechanisms.\u201d To examine the broader state of the race beyond debate night, the new HuffPost/YouGov poll also asked voters to look over the full slate of Democratic candidates and pick whom they\u2019d be enthusiastic or upset to see nominated, and who they believe is capable of defeating President Donald Trump. Biden still holds a clear, if not overwhelming, lead on electability: A 66% majority of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters thinks the former vice president is capable of winning the general election, a recovery of nearly 10 points since this summer. A smaller 56% majority currently believes Warren can win, with half saying the same of Sanders. Fewer than one-third say the same of any of the other candidates. Warren, meanwhile, stands out on enthusiasm, with 48% saying they\u2019d be enthusiastic about having her as the Democratic nominee and only 9% saying they\u2019re upset by that prospect. The idea of a Biden nomination raises only slightly less excitement (41% would be enthusiastic) but higher discontent (25% would be upset); a hypothetical Sanders nomination leaves 39% enthusiastic and 17% upset. Although Warren has often looked particularly strong in YouGov\u2019s polling compared to other outlets, other recent polling shows similar results. FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos debate polling also gives Warren strong reviews for last week\u2019s debate. And in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released this week, Warren led\u00a0both on enthusiasm and as the candidate with whom most primary voters would feel, at least, comfortable. Nearly all national polling that asks a straightforward horse race question \u2015 whom people would vote for if the election were today \u2015 shows Biden still ahead. But there\u2019s a significant variation on the exact size of Biden\u2019s lead, as well as whether Warren or Sanders now stands as his closest rival. One reason for that volatility is that the race remains exceptionally fluid. In\u00a0the HuffPost/YouGov survey, only 52% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they have even a good idea about whom they\u2019ll support, and in the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 9% of Democratic primary voters said they\u2019d definitely made up their minds. There\u2019s still months until anyone starts voting, and things could change pretty quickly once they do. For now, \u201cundecided\u201d may still be the real front-runner.

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " As Sunday turned to Monday, Briahna Gray, national press secretary for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, posted a series of criticisms of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Twitter. Gray began with subtlety, highlighting a speech the Vermont senator gave on the House floor in the 1990s in support of gay military veterans and service members. And, in what appeared to be a subtweet at Warren, she noted that Sanders delivered the speech at a time when \u201cyour fave was still \u2018evolving\u2019 (read \u2018triangulating\u2019) on gay rights.\u201d (In a follow-up conversation, Gray would not say to whom she was referring when she said \u201cfave.\u201d Warren supported same-sex marriage during her first Senate run in 2012, prior to former President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cevolution.\u201d) Next, Gray noted that under Sanders\u2019 pro-union legislation, Warren\u2019s campaign would be forced into mediation for failing to reach a collective bargaining agreement so many months after recognizing its campaign staff\u2019s union. Finally, in a post shortly after midnight, Gray slammed Warren\u2019s refusal to endorse a national rent control law, echoing a critique voiced earlier in the weekend by left-wing activists. She suggested that it contradicted Warren\u2019s self-described can-do attitude toward other ambitious policies. Gray\u2019s comments in themselves were not out of the ordinary. Sanders campaign aides are notoriously feisty and independent on social media \u2015 a marked contrast with the boringly disciplined etiquette of other campaigns\u2019 staffers. But when HuffPost reached out on Monday to clarify whether Gray\u2019s remarks were part of a shift toward more explicit confrontation with Warren, the campaign directed HuffPost to Gray, who stood by her remarks. \u201cPrimary campaigns are about drawing contrasts between candidates so that voters can make an informed choice between them,\u201d Gray said in a statement. Sanders and Warren reportedly struck a non-aggression pact in December prior to launching their respective campaigns. The much-vaunted d\u00e9tente survived two nationally televised debates in which the two contenders shared a stage. They eschewed the moderators\u2019 efforts to drive a wedge between them in favor of teaming up against moderate rivals. Even in the course of a conversation about this article, the Sanders campaign wanted to emphasize his high regard for Warren. \u201cSen. Sanders respects Sen. Warren and values his friendship with her,\u201d Mike Casca, a senior communications adviser for the Sanders campaign, said in a statement. \u201cThey\u2019ve been longtime allies in fighting to improve the lives of working Americans.\u201d But though Sanders himself has yet to criticize Warren, his aides and surrogates have been taking gradually bolder shots at the Massachusetts senator. The non-aggression pact is fraying. Gray\u2019s remarks follow more implicit steps in this direction by other Sanders lieutenants. Amid left-wing uproar over the Working Families Party\u2019s endorsement of Warren, top Sanders spokesman Mike Casca gave his blessing to calls for the WFP to release a breakdown of its endorsement vote that would show whether the group\u2019s national delegates overrode the will of pro-Sanders dues-paying members and activists. The following day, when Sanders received his millionth donor, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir noted that Sanders is the only candidate to rule out high-dollar private fundraisers for the primary as well as the general election. The observation was a veiled ding at Warren, who has said that in the interest of defeating President Donald Trump, she would resume courting wealthy donors during the general election. Just a few weeks ago, HuffPost reported that the Sanders campaign saw supporters of former Vice President Joe Biden as riper targets for persuasion. The campaign had a custom-made text message response for Biden backers, but only a generic one for voters leaning toward other candidates. But Warren\u2019s rise, reflected in everything from the WFP endorsement to new polling showing her winning more of Sanders\u2019 2016 voters than Sanders himself, has raised the specter of her supplanting Sanders as the go-to progressive alternative to Biden. The campaign aides\u2019 jabs at Warren, however tame and haphazard, provide an official imprimatur to a broader argument that Sanders surrogates and partisans have been making more openly for some time: that Warren\u2019s progressive bona fides are questionable and that she is a flawed general election candidate. Below is a summary and explanation of their various claims against her. The Warren campaign declined to comment for this story. The most recent pile-on against Warren kicked into gear over the weekend when she addressed the Iowa Center for Community Improvement Action Fund\u2019s candidate forum in Des Moines, Iowa. An activist pressed Warren on whether she would back national rent control legislation, which would cap annual rent increases across the country. Warren said that she would fight to ensure that localities are free from state laws that prevent them from pursuing rent control on their own, but would not back a national rent control law. \u201cWriting a rent control plan in Washington may work for Chicago, but it\u2019s not gonna work for Iowa City or it may not work for Dallas,\u201d she said. Warren introduced an affordable housing bill in March that would allot\u00a0$10 billion in grants that cities and regions could compete for, provided that they end restrictive land-use policies.\u00a0It would also give cities that enact tenant protections like rent control opportunities for additional cash. \u201cMy administration will also take whatever legal steps it can to stop states from preempting local efforts to enact tenant protection laws,\u201d she wrote in a Medium post outlining her housing plans. Warren would also invest $500 billion in building or restoring affordable housing \u2015 a figure she pays for by restoring the estate tax to its 2009 level. And she wants to create a home-buying assistance program for first-time buyers in historically redlined neighborhoods to narrow the Black-white wealth gap. Sanders, by contrast, would cap all annual rent increases at the higher of either 3% or 1.5 times the rate of inflation. Cities would be able to go further and landlords could apply for exemptions from the rule if they make major capital investments in a property. For some left-wing activists, particularly those living in expensive cities, making rent control \u201cuniversal\u201d \u2015 or at least expanding it \u2015 has become a priority nearly as urgent as achieving single-payer health care. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who volunteered for Sanders in 2016, introduced a rent control bill on Wednesday that also caps rent hikes at 3%. As a result, a video of Warren\u2019s exchange with the activist in Iowa posted by California-based labor organizer Brett Banditelli sparked biting criticism of Warren on social media. For example, Cea Weaver, who helped pass New York state\u2019s new rent regulations, suggested that Warren\u2019s lack of interest in national rent control reflected an elitist reliance on economic orthodoxy. Gray, the Sanders campaign aide, embedded Banditelli\u2019s video in her critical tweet as well. \u201cBernie says yes to [national] rent control [because] we can, we should, & we must,\u201d she wrote. Analilia Mejia, the Sanders campaign\u2019s political director, also highlighted the contrast between the two candidates\u2019 platforms on Twitter. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t a comparison,\u201d she wrote. Beginning with the first Democratic presidential debate in June, Warren has repeatedly affirmed her support for Sanders\u2019 single-payer \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care legislation. When pressed about the bill\u2019s prohibition on all but very limited forms of private health insurance \u2015 a provision that has stirred the most political jitters \u2015 Warren has endorsed it time and again. Two presidential rivals, Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, have, by comparison, backed away from Sanders\u2019 bill despite co-sponsoring it in the Senate. But some Sanders partisans note that Warren, a recent convert to the Medicare for All cause, still has not made it a major feature of her stump speech. She barely mentions the policy unless she is asked about it, and she has refused to explicitly say she would back middle-class taxes to pay for it. That has raised fears that Warren would not fight for it once in office, which Medicare for All proponents consider a prerequisite for its eventual passage. \u201cShe\u2019s simultaneously trying to tap into the activist energy and enthusiasm that activists have spent years building for single-payer and Medicare for All \u2026 without forfeiting any of the plausible deniability or the support of people who wouldn\u2019t want to go that far,\u201d Natalie Shure, a member of the Boston chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, told HuffPost. During a campaign event Wednesday in New Hampshire, Warren sparked a new round of skepticism when she described Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation, which she has co-sponsored, as a \u201cframework.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got in Medicare for All is a framework, and it doesn\u2019t have the details, and you\u2019re right to be asking, but the most important part of your asking is to raise awareness so we get this right as we go through it,\u201d Warren said. The remark prompted a swipe from Sanders\u2019 senior adviser Warren Gunnels, who disputed Warren\u2019s word choice on Twitter. Medicare for All \u201cisn\u2019t a framework. It\u2019s a 100-page bill,\u201d he wrote. Bernie World skepticism of Warren\u2019s support for Medicare for All is rooted in a broader suspicion of her more recent arrival at stances Sanders has held for decades. They argue that she is less trustworthy in general because she has admitted to being a registered Republican until the mid-1990s.\u00a0(Her research into the struggles of families declaring bankruptcy prompted her to leave the GOP, according to Warren.) Susan Sarandon, an Oscar-winning actor and prominent Sanders campaign surrogate, caused a stir in August when she took a veiled swipe at Warren while introducing Sanders at a campaign event in Iowa. Sanders, she said, \u201cis not someone who used to be a Republican. He is not someone who used to take money \u2014 or still takes money \u2014 from Wall Street. He is the real deal.\u201d Sarandon\u2019s remarks about taking money from Wall Street might refer to Warren\u2019s courtship of wealthy donors, including some from the financial world, during her 2018 Senate reelection campaign. She transferred over $10 million left over from that campaign to her presidential run before announcing that she would shun the fundraisers during the Democratic primary. (Warren\u2019s campaign has noted that big-ticket fundraisers accounted for only one-quarter of her total haul in 2017 and 2018.) John Cusack, another actor backing Sanders, introduced him at a rally on Tuesday in Chicago with members of several of the city\u2019s public-sector labor unions. He has echoed Sarandon\u2019s attacks on Warren\u2019s Republican past. \u201cNo ones [sic] been more consistent then [sic] Bernie for justice,\u201d he tweeted on Monday night. \u201cWarren was a republican as an adult -\u00a0 glad she figured out supply side economics was a hustle - but come on.\u201d In addition to their policy and ideology-based arguments that Warren is not radical enough, prominent Sanders supporters are also claiming that she is less competitive against Trump in a general election. The argument is twofold: First, they point to Warren\u2019s style on the stump and lower rates of support among Democrats without a college degree as evidence that she would have difficulty in a general election. Sanders had a narrow edge among voters with less than a college degree in an August poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, while Warren had a commanding lead over him among voters with advanced degrees. (Biden held the lead for voters at every education level except those with advanced degrees.) Krystal Ball, a co-host of Hill TV\u2019s digital show \u201cRising,\u201d made the case on Monday that Warren\u2019s appeal is stronger among more educated and successful Democrats because her focus on \u201cplans\u201d appeals to their meritocratic faith in common-sense problem-solving. Warren\u2019s failure to resonate with working-class voters despondent in the country\u2019s institutions make Ball \u201cterrified\u201d that Warren will lose to Trump, the pro-Sanders commentator said. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve got a plan for that\u2019 is like a magical elixir to\u201d highly educated Democrats, Ball said. \u201cIt says, \u2018The experts have been consulted, the white paper has been drafted. We the ascenders of the meritocracy will decide what is to be done about these poor, struggling denizens of the working class.\u2019\u201d Ball\u2019s characterization of Warren is not entirely accurate. She regularly denounces the political and economic system for being \u201crigged\u201d in favor of the super-rich, and has lionized grassroots movements like the one that emerged from the tragic fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in 1911 as models for the kind of structural change she hopes to usher in. And some analysts have noted that newcomers tend to fare worse among working-class voters at the start of primary contests, because those voters follow the news less consistently. When those candidates go on to win their party\u2019s presidential nomination and the general election though, working-class voters have tended to come along. Former President Barack Obama, for example, trailed Hillary Clinton with white working-class voters for much of the primary, but thanks to a populist message, ultimately won enough of their votes to prevail twice in states like Ohio. The second line of attack that Sanders supporters raise against Warren is their objection to her past identification as a Native American in various informal legal settings. Warren has apologized for producing a DNA test in October that showed she likely had traces of Cherokee heritage. She has also affirmed that she is not a person of color. But for some Sanders supporters, who appear to consider the dustup an electoral liability, Warren\u2019s apology is not enough. In a Twitter thread earlier this month, Josh Fox, an anti-fracking activist and filmmaker backing Sanders, said Warren\u2019s identification as Native American \u201cwhen she was actually a descendent of colonialists is a huge self-inflicted mistake.\u201d Fox went on to incorrectly assert that Warren had not even apologized. (In fact, she has apologized for the DNA test, as well as identifying as Native American in various professional legal listings.) \u201cWhy isn\u2019t owning a mistake like this possible? I think it would make her more sympathetic and more human to be honest,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf she just said- \u2018hey I was wrong about this, and I am being bullied by Donald Trump and etc.\u2019\u201d This piece has been updated with more information about Warren\u2019s proposed affordable housing bill.",

Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, her campaign told supporters in an email Friday, and now has $25.7 million to spend as the 2020 Democratic race enters its final stretch before primary season. The haul is second only to fellow progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) among contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders raised $25.3 million from July to September, while former Vice President Joe Biden raised just $15.2 million. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who trails the other top fundraisers by significant margins in public polling, raised just over $19 million. \u201cThis means our grassroots movement is in an incredible position \u2014 to double down on our investments in grassroots organizing, to keep getting Elizabeth\u2019s plans for big, structural change in front of more caucus-goers and voters, and to bring more people into this fight,\u201d campaign manager Roger Lau wrote. It is all but certain that Warren and Sanders \u2015 two left-leaning progressives who have chosen to bypass high-dollar fundraisers during the campaign \u2015 will be the two candidates with the most successful third quarters. Warren, in particular, faced skepticism over her decision to bypass high-dollar fundraising \u2015 an area where she had excelled prior to the 2020 presidential race. \u201cElizabeth didn\u2019t sell her time to wealthy donors, over the phone or in person at closed-door fundraisers,\u201d Lau wrote. \u201cInstead, she got to spend her time traveling across the country, hosting town halls, taking tens of thousands of selfies, and hearing directly from people about what\u2019s on their minds.\u201d Warren, whose steady rise now has her essentially tied with Biden in most public polling, had 943,000 donations from 509,000 different individual donors. The average donation was $26, and the campaign said more than 300,000 people donated for the first time during the third quarter. Among lower-tier candidates, California Sen. Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million, Andrew Yang raised $10 million and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker raised $6 million. Other candidates, including former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, have not yet released their fundraising totals. President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign said that it and the Republican National Committee \u2015 which can collect much bigger checks than the individual Democratic contenders \u2015 raised more than $125 million in the third quarter.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "On Thursday night, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren will share a presidential debate stage for the first time in a hotly anticipated showdown between the establishment Democratic front-runner and one of his fiercest progressive challengers. Biden and Warren\u2019s core disagreement centers on how hard the next president should push to fundamentally restructure the American economy. Warren has called for \u201cbig structural change\u201d; Biden promises a return to normalcy. To really understand this schism, you must consider the 36 years that then-Sen. Biden spent defending the uniquely pro-corporate laws of his home state, Delaware \u2014 laws that protect America\u2019s biggest companies from taxes, lawsuits and accountability; fuel economic inequality; and prioritize the interests of shareholders over those of consumers, debtors and workers. The system Biden protected affects every American: Because so many companies are registered there, Delaware is effectively the principal author and enforcer of much of the nation\u2019s corporate law. The state boasts more corporate registrations than human residents, including two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies. Delaware is corporate America\u2019s home base. Like Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 attacks on the \u201crigged economy,\u201d Warren\u2019s calls for change represent a direct challenge to Delaware\u2019s special status. By taking on three key policies that have made Delaware into the corporate paradise it is today, the Massachusetts senator is calling much of Biden\u2019s record into question. Warren\u2019s first and biggest target is the notion of shareholder primacy: the idea that corporate managers\u2019 most important legal duty is to maximize shareholders\u2019 wealth.\u00a0That means the interests of workers, families, local communities and the environment are of secondary importance to executives and board members. \u201cThat is in part a function of Delaware corporate law,\u201d said Kent Greenfield, a corporate and constitutional law professor at Boston College.\u00a0Under Delaware law \u2014 which covers all those companies registered in the state \u2015\u00a0shareholders must come first. In effect,\u00a0Delaware corporate law\u00a0encourages companies to undercut employee pay and ship jobs overseas in order to enrich shareholders. And it locks out other stakeholders, like workers and consumers, from being considered in the corporate decision-making process. Between 2007 and 2016, Warren noted last year, \u201clarge American companies dedicated 93% of their earnings to shareholders.\u201d This has other real-world consequences. When President Donald Trump pushed a massive corporate tax cut through Congress in 2017, for example, much of that money was returned to shareholders, rather than workers or other stakeholders. As vice president, Biden criticized shareholder primacy,\u00a0saying in 2016 that corporations should \u201cembrace your obligation to workers as well as your shareholders.\u201d But it\u2019s the competition between states to develop the most business-friendly corporate charters \u2015 the competition that Delaware won \u2015 that effectively ensures shareholder primacy across the nation. And the last time Congress moved to end that competition in the 1970s, Sen. Biden swooped in to defend Delaware\u2019s position. In the wake of a succession of corporate scandals and bankruptcies, the Senate held a series of hearings to examine whether the federal government, instead of the states, should issue corporate charters for large companies. These hearings were anathema to Delaware\u2019s politicians and business community. The state was then, as now, the national leader in corporate registrations.\u00a0Fees from business registrations were, and still are, a major source of funding for the state government. (Today, they account for more than one-quarter of the state\u2019s income.) Federalizing corporate charters would also cut profits for the state\u2019s lawyers, accountants and corporate registration companies. As Congress mulled a possible change, Biden appeared before two different committees to vouch for prominent Delaware lawyers who were there to argue against nationalizing corporate charters and for preserving Delaware\u2019s special position. At one hearing, he suggested that senators not attending should \u201ctake the time\u201d to review the lawyers\u2019 testimony \u201cbefore they make final decisions.\u201d Before another hearing, he praised the witness: \u201cHis judgment on these matters is also pretty sharp.\u201d Biden and Delaware won: Congress never moved to have the federal government take over issuing big corporate charters. The hearings fizzled out after Ronald Reagan took the White House and Republicans won the Senate in 1980. Now progressives like Sanders and Warren are trying again. In 2018, Warren introduced legislation to federalize the top tier of corporate charters and thereby take away Delaware\u2019s special place as the national writer of corporate law.\u00a0Warren\u2019s bill would require corporations with more than $1 billion in annual revenue to obtain a federal corporate charter that would require them to consider the needs of a broader array of stakeholders \u2014 employees, local communities, suppliers, the environment \u2014 when making decisions rather than solely focusing on the concerns of shareholders. \u201cThe role that Delaware plays in determining our system of corporate governance is also, in that sense, going to be in play in the coming campaign,\u201d said Robert Hockett, a Cornell Law School professor who advises Warren, Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). The second aspect of the Delaware system that Sanders and Warren have taken aim at is its credit card industry, which Biden boosted by making it harder for Americans to discharge credit card debt in bankruptcy. In 1981, Delaware state lawmakers, at the behest of Republican Gov. Pete du Pont, passed a sweeping financial deregulation bill designed to attract banks to the state. The bill, written by lobbyists for Chase Manhattan Bank and J.P. Morgan (then two separate companies), eliminated the state\u2019s interest rate caps and gave special tax treatment to financial institutions. Months after the legislation passed, MBNA Corporation, one of the largest credit card issuers in the country, relocated from Maryland to Delaware. In the decades that followed, Biden and the rest of Delaware\u2019s congressional delegation worked hard to protect MBNA and the other financial institutions that flocked to their state. One big problem for credit card issuers was federal bankruptcy law. As the credit card industry exploded in the 1980s and 1990s, an increasing number of Americans filed for personal bankruptcy protection \u2015 a legal process that allows individuals to prioritize what debts they can pay off and start anew with less debt than before. Creditors, including the credit card industry, banks and retailers, argued that people were taking advantage of the process to discharge debt they could otherwise pay. These businesses wanted the debts owed to them to be higher priority and harder to discharge. On the other side were academics led by Warren, then a Harvard Law School professor. Warren\u2019s research found that people filing for personal bankruptcy were generally dealing with a stroke of bad luck. They had a major medical expense, a messy divorce or a lost job. (Some of this research was \u2014 and remains \u2014 controversial.) And women made up a major proportion of those declaring bankruptcy. Warren argued that the system was a last-ditch safety net for hardworking people. In the late 1990s, the credit card industry funded a massive lobbying campaign to pass federal legislation to make it harder to discharge credit card debt in personal bankruptcy. They hired President Bill Clinton\u2019s former Treasury secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, and funded multiple questionable studies to back up their argument that fraud was causing the spike in bankruptcies. At the same time, Congress created a National Bankruptcy Review Commission to study the problem. The commission, which Warren served as reporter and senior adviser, mainly sided with the academics against the credit card industry. But the industry\u2019s lobbying campaign won out. The first legislation to change the bankruptcy process in favor of creditors was pushed through the House in 1997. It went through four separate iterations before ultimately becoming law in 2005. Republicans generally backed the bills while the majority of Democrats opposed them. That first bill passed the Senate too and almost became law \u2015 until Biden reportedly threatened to filibuster the measure because the House had made it too friendly to creditors in conference committee. Nonetheless, he had initially voted for that bill, and afterward, he took the reins as the main Democratic voice in favor of rewriting bankruptcy law. News reports at the time referred to Biden as \u201cthe linchpin to passage,\u201d \u201cthe only Democratic true believer\u201d and \u201cpossibly the bankruptcy bill\u2019s staunchest defender.\u201d In 2000, President Clinton pocket-vetoed another version of the bill on the advice of first lady Hillary Clinton, whom Warren had convinced to oppose the measure. A Democratic amendment that would have prevented abortion opponents from using bankruptcy to discharge legal debt stemming from their participation in violent protests killed the 2001 bill. Finally, with a bigger Republican majority in 2005, Congress passed a bill that was signed into law by President George W. Bush. Biden was one of a minority of Senate Democrats who voted for the legislation all four times. Today, Biden claims that his support was part of an effort to improve legislation that was ultimately going to pass with or without him. As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2005, he saw it as his job to work with Republicans and Democrats to solve the issue of rising personal bankruptcies. Through his actions, he helped to protect lower-income debtors, prioritize alimony and child support payments, and increase credit card disclosure, according to the Biden campaign. The former vice president has \u201cchampioned the middle class for his entire career and has a proven track record of delivering on his progressive values,\u201d said Mike Gwin, a Biden campaign spokesman. But though he showed some distaste for creditors\u2019 goals, Biden believed the bill was necessary and tried time and time again to pass it. He\u00a0shoehorned the measure into a foreign affairs bill to get it before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he was ranking member, in 2000. He cast the deciding and only Democratic vote in a 10-8 split supporting the bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2001. \u201cI am so sick of this self-righteous sheen put on anybody who wants to tighten up bankruptcy [who] is [painted as] really anti-debtor,\u201d Biden said at a 2001 hearing. \u201cPeople are getting hurt.\u201d Over the years, he voted against numerous consumer-friendly amendments offered by his Democratic colleagues that would have eased the bill\u2019s new requirements for consumers filing bankruptcy over medical debts or debts incurred while on active-duty military service. He opposed other amendments that would have put caps on credit card interest rates and penalized mortgage lenders if they had broken the Truth in Lending Act when they extended credit. \u201cSome of these looked like they were sympathetic to people with real issues, but they were not good public policy solutions,\u201d a former Biden Senate aide said. Through the many iterations of the bankruptcy bill, Warren emerged as its fiercest outside opponent. And she directly took on Biden. The year after the 2001 bill failed, Warren wrote a 39-page article in the Harvard Women\u2019s Law Journal arguing that politicians like Biden should be forced to pay a political price for supporting economic legislation that hurts women. Biden\u2019s assertion that he made the bill prioritize women was misleading, Warren argued. Biden said he moved alimony and child support up the list of priorities for payment when a person entered personal bankruptcy. Child support services professionals backed his proposal, arguing that it would \u201crevolutionize the enforcement of support obligations against debtors in bankruptcy.\u201d But Warren wrote that this move was simply a sleight-of-hand, pushing alimony and child support payments above priorities that only came into play in business-related bankruptcies. The practical effects of the proposed change, she wrote, \u201cwould be either nonexistent or detrimental.\u201d More to the point, the latest bill\u2019s restrictions on personal bankruptcy would fall hardest on women because it was women who made up the majority of bankruptcy filings, Warren argued. \u201cFor a million women who will go to the bankruptcy courts each year, there is no more important pending federal legislation,\u201d she wrote. Major women\u2019s rights organizations, including the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Partnership for Women and Families, and the National Women\u2019s Law Center, opposed the bill for the same reason. Warren and Biden finally came face to face at a Senate hearing on bankruptcy in 2005. In a now-famous exchange, he back-handedly complimented her for making \u201ca very compelling and mildly demagogic argument.\u201d He suggested she was targeting the wrong credit card problem by opposing the bankruptcy bill. \u201cYour problem with credit card companies is usury rates from your position,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt is not about the bankruptcy bill.\u201d \u201cBut, Senator, if you are not going to fix that problem, you can\u2019t take away the last shred of protection from these families,\u201d Warren replied. \u201cI got it, OK. You are very good, Professor,\u201d Biden said to laughs from Warren and the audience. The 2005 law did reduce the personal bankruptcy filing rate. But studies indicate the law made it harder for the country to rebound from the 2008 financial crisis, led to 250,000 additional home foreclosures\u00a0and drove\u00a0a 25% increase in persistent insolvency. The pro-creditor status quo might not last forever \u2014 especially if Sanders or Warren wins the presidential election and the Democrats retake control of the Senate. The Sanders campaign announced on Sept. 5 that it would introduce a proposal to roll back parts of the 2005 law to help those with heavy medical debts. The Warren campaign has yet to release any bankruptcy-related reforms. The third pillar of the Delaware system that Sanders and Warren have challenged are the laws that make it a favorite place for companies to file for bankruptcy. Biden, again, has been on the other side. In the early 2000s, Enron, an energy services firm, collapsed amid a massive corruption scandal. John Cornyn, then attorney general of Texas, pushed the company to file for bankruptcy in Houston, where it was based and where it employed 7,500 people.\u00a0Instead, Enron filed for bankruptcy in Manhattan, where one of its subsidiaries was incorporated and it employed 57 people. This was possible because U.S. law allows corporations to file in any state in which they or their subsidiaries are incorporated. In other words, companies can venue or forum shop, effectively choosing the jurisdiction most favorable to their interests in bankruptcy. And there are two favorite venues: Delaware and New York. The Los Angeles Dodgers filed for bankruptcy in Delaware. General Motors, famously of Detroit, filed for bankruptcy in Manhattan. There is a longstanding debate in the world of corporate bankruptcy law about whether venue shopping is a problem. Some contend it makes sense to let companies go to Manhattan and Delaware where the judges have greater experience in handling large, complicated bankruptcies.\u00a0But others, like Warren, argue that venue shopping allows corporations to pick their judges while creating steep burdens for employees, pensioners and other small creditors to attend out-of-town proceedings and pay the higher legal fees charged in both Delaware and Manhattan. That\u2019s what Enron\u2019s employees argued. And it was why now-Sen. Cornyn, with Warren\u2019s help, authored an amendment to the 2005 bankruptcy reform bill to ban venue shopping. At that same committee hearing, he asked her to explain her concerns about the practice. \u201cIn the case of large corporations that can leave their home venue \u2015 Enron, who can leave Houston, Texas, where its employees, where its pensioners, where its trade creditors reside \u2015 and escape the obligation to make the process open to the thousands of people who are directly affected by the bankruptcy, that affects the bankruptcy system overall,\u201d Warren said. \u201cA fair bankruptcy system is one that retains access for the employees, for the pensioners, for the small creditors, and that means those cases need to stay home, not go to a distant location where they [the corporations] think they may get a better deal.\u201d Warren\u2019s comment \u2015 that corporations could \u201cescape the obligation to make the process open\u201d \u2015 angered Biden. \u201cI find it outrageous such a statement,\u201d Biden said before asking Warren if she thought Delaware courts weren\u2019t open. Delaware\u2019s dominance in corporate bankruptcy cases is a side effect of its dominance in corporate charter registration. It\u2019s also a huge cash cow for local businesses from law firms to hotels to restaurants. But to critics like Warren, it makes it easier for the little people to get screwed. \u201cEmployees of companies like Enron literally cannot go to Delaware and hire local counsel, which the Delaware bankruptcy court requires them [to do] before they can make an appearance, and that effectively cuts thousands of small employees, pensioners and local trade creditors out of the bankruptcy process,\u201d Warren tried to explain to Biden. \u201cIf they can\u2019t afford it, they are not there.\u201d Before moving on, Biden declared that Cornyn\u2019s amendment was going nowhere. Biden and his fellow Delaware senator, Tom Carper, threatened to withhold their votes from the bankruptcy bill if the venue shopping amendment was attached. Cornyn withdrew it under pressure from Republican leadership in order to placate the two Democrats. That wasn\u2019t the first time Biden had quashed an effort to stop venue shopping in corporate bankruptcy. \u201cMost of these proposals were to remove an industry Delaware had built up and to get a piece of the action for themselves,\u201d the former Biden Senate aide said. \u201cAs long as Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware is in the Senate,\u201d any possibility of venue shopping reform is \u201cnonexistent,\u201d Brady Williamson, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission\u2019s chairman, observed in 2006. When Warren won election to the Senate in 2012, she joined Cornyn as the Democratic co-sponsor on legislation to ban venue shopping.\u00a0But the bill hasn\u2019t moved in the Senate even though Biden is gone. Delaware\u2019s current Democratic senators \u2015 Carper and Chris Coons \u2015 have taken his place as its biggest opponents. \u201cIt\u2019s another one of these \u2018what\u2019s good for Delaware and to hell with the nation,\u2019\u201d said Adam Levitin, a bankruptcy law professor at Georgetown University Law Center. It\u2019s no big surprise when senators promote their home state\u2019s business interests. \u201cI take it very personally when my colleague or a colleague in the Senate decides to take an action that would benefit his state only marginally but would do great damage to my state,\u201d Biden said in 2004. \u201cI take that very personally.\u201d Biden\u2019s competitors for the Democratic presidential nomination have done it too. Sanders has supported stationing F-35 jets in Vermont, bringing jobs and dollars to his state.\u00a0Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), whose states are both home to big medical device manufacturers, endorsed a bill to repeal the medical device tax included in the Affordable Care Act. And Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), whose state is home to numerous pharmaceutical companies, voted against a proposal to lower drug prices. What has made Biden\u2019s parochialism so significant is that his state\u2019s special interests are central to the structure of the U.S. \u2014 and global \u2014 economy. By putting his state first, Biden helped to build and protect the economic structure that Warren and Sanders blame for a wide range of Americans\u2019 troubles. That is what the coming debates will be about. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated incorrectly that Biden voted against a 2005 amendment to bar wealthy bankruptcy filers from hiding assets in special asset protection trusts. He voted for it.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " The Working Families Party, a leading progressive organization with roots in organized labor, announced Monday that it is endorsing the presidential bid of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The group\u2019s backing provides a boost to Warren as she seeks to solidify her climb in the polls and replace Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, as the leading alternative on the left to former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cSenator Warren strikes fear into the hearts of the robber barons who rigged the system, and offers hope to millions of working people who have been shut out of our democracy and economy,\u201d Maurice Mitchell, Working Families Party national director, said in a statement. \u201cOur job now is to help Senator Warren build the mass movement that will make her transformational plans a reality.\u201d As part of the group\u2019s endorsement process, Mitchell grilled five presidential candidates \u2015 Warren, Sanders, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2015 on live broadcasts that gave members the opportunity to submit questions or ask them live. Warren distinguished herself in her interview by, among other things, promising to repeal the 1994 crime bill authored by Biden. The group\u2019s interview with Booker proved more contentious, with an extended discussion of his ties to controversial Garden State political bosses. Sen. Kamala Harris of California canceled her interview with the organization, citing a scheduling conflict, a decision that prompted the group to take her out of the running.\u00a0The group had ruled out all but those six candidates based on their answers to a questionnaire. The endorsement, reflecting the views of 61% of Working Families Party members and leaders in a ranked-choice voting system, is a particularly sharp disappointment for Sanders, who picked up the group\u2019s backing in the 2016 election cycle, but received just 36% of the vote from participating members this time around. The Sanders campaign\u2019s political director, Analilia Mejia, is the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party. Mitchell acknowledged Sanders\u2019 role as a progressive trailblazer in his statement on the endorsement. \u201cSenator Warren and Senator Sanders have both shaped the ideological terrain on which this campaign is being waged,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThey have proven an effective team on debate stages and in the polls, and we hope that partnership continues. We\u2019re proud to call both of them allies in the fight for a more just America.\u201d The endorsement nonetheless drew skepticism from Sanders supporters, some of whom questioned the legitimacy of the endorsement process and talked of canceling their dues to the organization. Some Sanders supporters interpreted a Mitchell quote in\u00a0The New York Times in which he warned against progressives who hoped to defeat moderate Democrats with \u201cthought pieces or pithy tweets\u201d as a dig at them. Mitchell denied that was his intention in an interview with HuffPost. \u201cI was talking about the work all of us have to do to defeat the far right and the corporate forces who want to capture the Democratic nomination \u2015 all those forces. We need to organize against them,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201dI wouldn\u2019t take this occasion to choose to settle a score against a candidate who I think is amazing and doing great work.\u201d Mitchell acknowledged, however, that the endorsement causes pain to many Working Families Party members who are staunchly in Sanders\u2019 corner and raises the challenge of moving forward as a unified bloc. \u201cWe knew that this would be a hard vote and that there would be folks who would be very disappointed. And that\u2019s what happens when mature political organizations wrestle around really important decisions,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201dWe\u2019re going to continue to organize and keep our eyes on the prize.\u201d Mitchell and the Working Families Party also stand behind the fairness of the endorsement process. In the previous presidential election cycle, members of the group\u2019s national committee \u2015 the council of unions and grassroots groups that function as its key stakeholders \u2015 held the vast majority of votes in the endorsement process. This year, activists who are not on the national committee \u2015 both dues-paying members and supporters who do not pay dues \u2015 were allotted half of the votes. The roughly 50 activist leaders representing grassroots organizations on WFP\u2019s national committee had votes worth the other half of the total. And while activists who do not pay dues were permitted to cast ballots in the 2016 election cycle, Working Families Party claims it took specific steps to screen them this year, including through an email blast that required progressives to affirm their support for the group\u2019s agenda and proceed through an online portal for voting. In total, about 10,000 people cast ballots, according to the group. The Working Families Party has neither demographic data about the participants in its endorsement process, nor insight into the rationale of activists who opted for Warren over Sanders.\u00a0It likewise declined to provide a breakdown of votes for either candidate based on whether participants were activist leaders with privileged voting status, dues-paying members or mere sympathetic supporters. Mitchell said that, on a personal note, he appreciates Warren\u2019s ability to communicate progressive ideas to a diverse array of people. \u201cWe need a candidate that can break down these concepts in ways that encourage a multiracial alignment of folks to defeat Trump and defeat neo-fascism and I think she\u2019s uniquely positioned to do that,\u201d he said. Warren\u2019s endorsement last Monday of Kendra Brooks, a WFP candidate running for Philadelphia city council, swayed some members of WFP\u2019s leadership with privileged voting status, according to a progressive strategist familiar with these leaders\u2019 thinking. The Working Families Party was founded in 1998 by a coalition of New York labor unions and community organizations hoping to establish a progressive foothold within the Democratic Party-run politics of the Empire State. In New York, where the group retains its largest presence, progressive Democrats have the chance to run on its ballot line as well as that of the Democratic Party as a show of strength from the party\u2019s progressive wing. As Working Families Party has matured, it has gotten bolder in its political stances and more distant from its roots in New York\u2019s labor unions. A decision by the group to endorse Cynthia Nixon\u2019s challenge to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the 2018 Democratic primary at once prompted an exodus of nearly all of the labor unions backing the organization and freed it to chart a more independent path. Although New York remains its hub, the Working Families Party now has state-level affiliates in 13 other states and the District of Columbia, as well as local branches in four others. States with affiliates include the general-election battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Working Families Party, which often sets up PACs to boost candidates it endorses in state and local elections, has yet to spell out exactly how it will use its resources to buttress Warren\u2019s 2020 bid. Mitchell, who is African American and previously served as a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, said that the group is well equipped to organize working-class voters and voters of color \u2015 some of the very people polls suggest Warren has had difficulty attracting. Referring to these voting blocs, Mitchell said, \u201cThere are a number of communities that often do not get heard and get taken for granted, unfortunately by a lot of Democrats. It\u2019s going to be our interest to lift them up.\u201d The endorsement from a powerhouse of New York politics comes ahead of a rally Warren is holding in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Square Park on Monday evening. The Warren campaign chose the site for its proximity to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, a sweatshop where a fire in 1911 killed 145 garment workers. Warren plans to discuss the resonance that the tragedy, which became a rallying cry for labor organizing in the city and across the country, has for her campaign and the movement she is trying to build.

      "content": "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign is set to begin a major advertising blitz, spending at least $10 million in the first four states to vote in the 2020 Democratic primary. The campaign also plans to begin hiring staff in primary states that vote in March, including on all-important Super Tuesday. Building operations in the March states is crucial \u2015 three-fifths of the Democratic delegates will be awarded by the end of 2020\u2019s third month. The new spending, announced in a memo to supporters from campaign manager Roger Lau, shows how Warren plans to continue the momentum that\u2019s elevated her into the top tier of primary contenders, alongside Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden. The size of the advertising buy also highlights how Warren has been able to continue raising gobs of cash after deciding to stop attending high-dollar fundraising. \u201cOur biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,\u201d Lau wrote in his email. \u201cBecause we\u2019re 100% grassroots funded, we\u2019ve built our team to spend your dollars as effectively as possible to help deliver victory.\u201d Lau said the ad buy will mostly be on digital platforms rather than traditional broadcast television, and the campaign will produce the ads in-house rather than using a traditional media consultant. \u201cTake any of our big problems: Health care, climate change, gun violence. Corruption is at the root of why our government won\u2019t act,\u201d Warren says in a 15-second ad as President Donald Trump and former House Speaker Paul Ryan appear onscreen. \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth Warren. I know what\u2019s wrong, I know how to fix it and I\u2019ll fight to get it done.\u201d The Warren campaign also released a 60-second ad highlighting her roots in Oklahoma and the hollowing out of the American middle class, and a 30-second ad highlighting her work to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and defeat former GOP Sen. Scott Brown. \u201cLeave it to a liberal professor to highlight a speech she gave at a liberal university in the heart of liberal New York City,\u201d Republican National Committee Communications Director Michael Ahrens said, referring to the 60-second ad that uses footage from her Sept. 17 rally. \u201cWarren may have plans, but they would decimate millions of middle class jobs and eliminate health plans for 200 million Americans.\u201d Lau provided fewer details on the campaign\u2019s staffing plans in the March states, but highlights Illinois, California, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Texas and Florida as places where it will make investments. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the U.S. Senate, and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020,\u201d he wrote. Warren has been steadily rising in the polls and attracting massive crowds to her rallies. She\u2019s eschewed exclusive fundraisers with wealthy donors generally favored by presidential candidates as a way to amass campaign cash, instead relying on grassroots outreach \u2015 more than 1 million donations from all 50 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Warren has become known for her personal outreach to supporters. She calls donors out of the blue to thank them for their contribution, and stays for hours after campaign events to take selfies with people. Lau estimates that she has done more than 60,000 selfies and taken more than 600 unfiltered questions at 134 town halls in 27 states and Puerto Rico.

      "author": "",
      "content": "The attempt to pile on Elizabeth Warren has begun. The senator from Massachusetts, who has firmly joined Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential field\u2019s top tier, has faced a barrage of critiques in recent days from campaigns who often claim she has received a free pass from the media. Many of these attacks happen without ever mentioning Warren\u2019s name. Candidates \u2015 including Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana \u2015 often talk about how Democrats need to have more than Warren\u2019s signature policy plans in order to win. A staffer for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) suggested Warren hadn\u2019t done enough to help Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms. (She donated $11 million to other candidates and progressive causes.) Others have been more direct: The always-colorful, oft-quoted former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Biden surrogate, attacked Warren as a \u201chypocrite\u201d for touting her decision not to hold high-dollar fundraisers after holding them in the past. But the attacks that could land the most damage focus on Warren\u2019s trustworthiness on health care, the No. 1\u00a0issue for voters in both the Democratic primary and in the general election, according to polling. Though Warren has rolled her out own detailed policy plans on everything from gun control to child care to rural economic development, she is the only leading candidate to avoid releasing her own health care plan, instead endorsing Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation while saying she remains open to alternatives. The position has left her vulnerable to attacks from Sanders supporters as well as from opponents of Medicare for All, which would eliminate private health insurance and require the government to pay for Americans\u2019 health coverage. Warren\u2019s steady rise in the Democratic primary has come, in large part, from her ability to appeal to both the party\u2019s mainstream and left-wing branches, but health care is an issue that could turn chunks of both groups against her and undercut her central image as a candidate with a brilliant idea for every problem. \u201cI support Medicare for All. I think it\u2019s a good plan,\u201d Warren told CBS after the Sept. 12 Democratic debate in Houston when asked if she would roll out her own health care plan. But she quickly added: \u201cI support a lot of plans, other things that people have come up with it. When they\u2019re good plans, let\u2019s do it. This isn\u2019t some kind of contest, \u2018I got to think of mine first.\u2019 It\u2019s about what\u2019s best for the American people.\u201d Buttigieg, appearing on CNN on Thursday, noted that Warren has avoided explicitly stating if she would support higher taxes on middle-income earners of the kind needed to fund a single-payer system. Two days earlier, during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d Stephen Colbert was unable to pin Warren down on the need for higher taxes to fund Medicare for All. Warren instead stuck to her formulation that under her plan net\u00a0\u201ccosts\u201d would go down\u00a0for the vast majority of Americans because of the elimination of out-of-pocket expenses. \u201cSen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we\u2019ve seen that repeatedly,\u201d Buttigieg said of Warren\u2019s refusal to directly answer Colbert\u2019s questions. \u201cI think that if you are proud of your plan and it\u2019s the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms.\u201d (Buttigieg, who rolled out his own health care plan on Thursday, has said only that he would fund an expansion of health care coverage by closing corporate tax loopholes, without further details.) Biden echoed this line of attack during a Friday event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, suggesting Warren and Sanders were hiding the effect of Medicare for All. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat Trump by not being straightforward about what it\u2019s going to do,\u201d he told a voter who questioned why he wasn\u2019t supporting Medicare for All. Buttigieg, along with Biden and other moderate Democrats, has long argued that Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s stated preference for Medicare for All is politically unwise and would cause chaos for tens of millions of Americans with private health insurance. But the recent attacks have focused squarely on the question of tax increases. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally dishonest, because for people\u2019s pocketbooks, Medicare for All will be a tax decrease, and the people saying this know that,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and a prominent Warren backer. \u201cIt\u2019s an insurance company and Republican talking point.\u201d Green also claimed Warren\u2019s \u201crefusal to take the bait\u201d was helping her with Democrats. \u201cRepublicans will inevitably make unfair attacks in the general election. We can\u2019t live in fear of that. But we don\u2019t need to give them Democratic validators.\u201d Warren is a relatively recent convert to single-payer, signing on to Sanders\u2019 legislation only in September 2017. Since then, she has continued to work on interim fixes to the private health insurance system. In March 2018, she backed legislation \u2015 co-sponsored by Sanders \u2015 designed to tighten regulations on private insurers and keep them in the Affordable Care Act exchanges. When she first began running for president, she discussed protecting Medicaid more than pushing for single-payer. But at the first Democratic debate on June 27, she made her stance clear: She was\u00a0\u201cwith Bernie on Medicare for All,\u201d including the elimination of private health insurance. Warren reiterated her stance in the two subsequent debates and an interview released earlier this month with dying progressive activist Ady Barkan. Barkan, who has his used his struggles with ALS to help illustrate the need for single-payer health care, specifically pressed her to explain her greater reluctance on the topic closer to the start of her campaign. \u201cThere are areas where markets just don\u2019t work and a big part of health care is one of those,\u201d Warren told Barkan. \u201cSo the idea that we could get a couple of regulations in place and it will sort itself out is just not true with health care.\u201d One advantage for Warren is that the National Nurses United union, a major institutional backer of Medicare for All that endorsed Sanders in the 2016 cycle, has not yet endorsed in the 2020 presidential primary. Asked whether the union considered Warren\u2019s stance adequate, NNU spokesperson Chuck Idelson would not respond directly, instead saying that if the union decides to endorse in the race, it will \u201ccertainly explain\u201d how the endorsement is \u201cconsonant\u201d with its priorities. But Warren\u2019s remarks have failed to assuage left-wing Sanders supporters \u2015 many of whom are associated with the Democratic Socialists of America or Jacobin magazine \u2015\u00a0 who don\u2019t think they can count on her to enact a policy they believe is the bedrock of a robust, contemporary welfare state. They point to small signals from Warren \u2015 her failure to give the plan a prominent place on her campaign website or to give it more than a passing mention in most of her speeches \u2015 as reasons to be skeptical. Natalie Shure, a leading Medicare for All advocate and dues-paying member of the Boston chapter of the DSA, argued Thursday on the popular left-wing YouTube show\u00a0\u201cThe Majority Report\u201d that Warren was not willing to \u201cfight tooth and nail for a robust, single-payer, Medicare for All health care system.\u201d In a follow-up interview with HuffPost, Shure said that Warren\u2019s unwillingness to explicitly embrace the need for middle-class tax hikes to fund Medicare for All is emblematic of her tepidness on the matter. \u201cShe\u2019s simultaneously trying to tap into the activist energy and enthusiasm that activists have spent years building for single-payer and Medicare for All \u2026 without forfeiting any of the plausible deniability or the support of people who wouldn\u2019t want to go that far,\u201d Shure said. That\u2019s a distinction from Sanders, who has staked his presidential run on the ability to galvanize a social movement \u2015 a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d \u2015 capable of at least generating momentum behind Medicare for All, according to Shure. \u201cShe looks at her role differently than a Sanders presidency would look at his role,\u201d Shure said. \u201cHe would lead a movement to get it, which I think is necessary for anyone who wants it. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d veto it if it came to her desk. She might even whip votes for it. But I don\u2019t think she is going to reach outside of electoral politics for it.\u201d Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Sanders stalwart who carried the single-payer bill in the House, put it more gently. Warren \u201chasn\u2019t eased up on it. She hasn\u2019t wavered, gotten weak in the knees,\u201d he said, referring to Warren\u2019s recent remarks affirming her support for the policy. \u201cBut I think it means something that Bernie carried the bill, wrote the bill and has been fighting for it even before it was a popular thing.\u201d",

      "content": "NEW YORK \u2015\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) drew thousands of New Yorkers to her presidential campaign rally Monday in Washington Square Park, where she discussed her plans to fight corruption and support workers nationwide. The Democratic presidential hopeful honored the scores of mostly immigrant women who died in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911 \u2014 which occurred about a block from where Warren spoke Monday \u2014 and praised the women\u2019s trade unions that fought for change in the wake of the tragedy. \u201cWe\u2019re not here today because of famous arches or famous men,\u201d Warren said, referring to the park\u2019s iconic arch looming behind her, which is named for President George Washington. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re not here because of men at all. We\u2019re here because of some hard-working women. Women who, more than a hundred years ago, worked long hours in a brown, 10-story building a block that way.\u201d Nearly 150 people \u2015 mostly Jewish and Italian female workers \u2015 died in March 1911 when the factory went up in flames and their bosses, fearing the employees might steal scraps of fabric, trapped them inside by locking the exit doors. \u201cIt was one of the worst industrial disasters in American history,\u201d Warren said. \u201cOne of the worst, but it should not have been a surprise.\u201d Working conditions at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory were infamous, but the company\u2019s owners were wealthy, politically connected and corrupt, she said. \u201cThey made campaign contributions and talked with their friends in the legislature,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThey greased the state government so thoroughly that nothing changed. Business owners got richer, politicians got more powerful, and working people paid the price.\u201d \u201cDoes any of this sound familiar?\u201d she asked the crowd, which responded with an affirmative cheer. \u201cTake any big problem we have in America today and you don\u2019t have to dig very deep to see the same system at work.\u201d The Harvard law professor-turned-senator\u2019s rally in Manhattan is the culmination of a day filled with headline-generating announcements designed to cement her second-place standing in many early polls and replace Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as the left\u2019s alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden. Warren unveiled a plan early Monday morning to combat Washington corruption that builds on legislation she introduced in August 2018 curbing, among other things, the influence of lobbyists. A few hours later, she received the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a national progressive organization that backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 election cycle. At the rally, Warren also debuted the endorsements of two young, progressive New York state lawmakers, state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi and Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, who said that Warren would finish the fight against corruption that they were waging in New York\u2019s capital of Albany. Biaggi was part of a crop of six left-leaning Democrats who unseated a rogue faction of Democratic state senators aligned with the GOP who effectively kept the legislative chamber in Republican control. (Biaggi and Niou are part of a list of 14 New York City and state lawmakers who have endorsed Warren, according to the campaign.) Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party, introduced Warren on stage before her speech, attesting to her potential appeal beyond the group of highly educated voters that polling suggests are her most ardent supporters. \u201cElizabeth Warren has proposed a whole host of solutions that meet the full scale of the crises we face ... Elizabeth Warren has a plan for it!\u201d he said. \u201cBut crucially, Sen. Warren realizes that you need more than plans; we need to meet this moment with a movement of working people.\u201d Warren\u2019s show of force Monday evening was seemingly aimed at showcasing her strength in progressive bastions that were once Sanders\u2019 exclusive stomping grounds. The Vermont senator drew massive crowds to a rally in the same park in April 2016, claiming some 27,000 people attended. Warren\u2019s campaign said more than 20,000 people attended her rally, making it her largest to date. A spokesperson for the city Department of Parks and Recreation told HuffPost that officials believe the park\u2019s capacity is 10,000, and that Warren\u2019s event had a permit for 8,000 to 10,000 people. The city said it could not corroborate Warren\u2019s crowd estimate. Sanders supporters often argue that their candidate is a more consistent and more effective champion of grassroots social movements than Warren, whose most famous campaign slogan \u2015 \u201cI got a plan\u201d \u2015 evokes a more technocratic approach than Sanders\u2019 \u201cpolitical revolution.\u201d On Monday evening though, Warren also emphasized her commitment to building a grassroots movement capable of powering her plans to fruition. Warren turned the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory tale into a parable for inside-outside organizing \u2015 a term for policymaking that pairs mass mobilization with specialized legislative expertise and horse-trading. She described how one woman moved by the tragic spectacle of the fire was Frances Perkins, who went on to serve Franklin Delano Roosevelt as secretary of labor \u2015 both when he was governor of New York and later when he became president. Perkins is widely viewed as the architect of New York\u2019s first major labor reforms, as well as the social-democratic policies at the heart of the New Deal, including Social Security and a law establishing the first minimum wage. \u201cAs Frances Perkins put it: the Triangle Fire was \u2018the day the New Deal was born,\u2019\u201d Warren said. Warren went on to recount how the movements for the abolition of slavery, women\u2019s voting rights, labor rights, black civil rights and LGBTQ rights had all had to withstand skepticism of their power to effect change. But they persevered, she argued, just as Americans must now do to end corruption and restructure the economy. \u201cThey organized. They built a grassroots movement. They persisted,\u201d she said, referencing a famous complaint GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made about her. \u201cAnd they changed the course of American history.\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign went the extra mile to paint her movement as an extension of Perkins\u2019 work. The podium from which she spoke was constructed by an all-female woodworking company run by a supporter using old barn wood from Perkins\u2019 historic home in Maine. Perkins\u2019 grandson,\u00a0Tomlin Perkins Coggeshall, procured the wood for the campaign and attended the rally. Some voters who supported Sanders in 2016 but showed up for Warren on Monday said they had gone with Sanders when it was a binary choice because they preferred him to Hillary Clinton. Astrid Clarke, a 49-year-old student and caregiver from Brooklyn\u2019s East New York neighborhood, thought Sanders was a better bet than Clinton in the general election last time. Now she \u201cloves\u201d Warren for her plans. \u201cI like the way it\u2019s people-centric and the way she can explain it so you know that it\u2019s hers,\u201d Clarke said. Other attendees said they had been Clinton supporters. One such Clinton supporter, Katie Carella, a 39-year-old children\u2019s publishing professional living in Manhattan, also emphasized Warren\u2019s \u201cplans.\u201d \u201cShe literally has a plan for everything,\u201d Carella said. \u201cI think we have to be asking for big structural changes in order to make any headway.\u201d This story has been updated with additional comments from Warren, and from a spokesperson for the city Department of Parks and Recreation.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Rep. Katie Porter is in a bit of an awkward spot. The California Democrat, a protege and former student of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), has yet to make an endorsement in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary \u2015 even as Warren has emerged as a leading candidate in the race, drawing ever-larger crowds on the campaign trail and beating out former Vice President Joe Biden in recent polls. One reason for Porter\u2019s reluctance could be that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is still very much in the race. Porter shares a history with Harris, too: As attorney general of California, Harris appointed Porter to be the state\u2019s independent monitor of banks, and Porter has spoken of Harris as another mentor in her political rise. Harris has more to gain from Porter\u2019s endorsement, given her plunge in the polls over the last month, including surveys conducted of Democratic voters in California. In the latest University of California, Berkeley, Institute of Governmental Studies poll of the state, Warren led the field with 29% of likely Democratic primary voters. Harris trailed with just 8%. Even as Porter has stayed neutral, other California Democrats have gotten off the sidelines and backed various candidates in the presidential primary. \u201cI adore Elizabeth and Kamala,\u201d Porter told HuffPost recently. \u201cI think either of them would be terrific presidents. I\u2019m very enthusiastic and supportive of both of them, and that\u2019s where it stands.\u201d Spokespersons for both the Warren and Harris campaigns did not respond to a request for comment. Porter received endorsements from both senators in her long-shot 2018 bid for Congress in the heart of Orange County, California, which was once a conservative bastion before Donald Trump came along. In Congress, Porter teamed up with both senators to tackle issues touching on consumer protections and corporate malfeasance. A bicameral bill she co-sponsored with Warren and other senators sought to bolster the power of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, whose creation Warren spearheaded. Porter also introduced legislation with Harris that would strengthen the power of state attorneys general to monitor banks. Other Democrats are likely weighing similar decisions as they watch the 2020 jockeying ahead of the pivotal Iowa caucuses. Rep. Mike Levin, another first-term California Democrat, told HuffPost he doesn\u2019t anticipate endorsing until the California primary. \u201cYou can count me in the \u2018anybody but Trump\u2019 column,\u201d Levin said. Biden currently has the most support from prominent members of the party, according to The New York Times\u2019 endorsement tracker, including many from states that are not his native Pennsylvania or Delaware. Harris, meanwhile, has the backing of four California representatives, including first-term Rep. Katie Hill. \u201cThere are many senators running for president and many members of Congress know them personally. There\u2019s nothing easy about backing someone who\u2019s not your hometown senator,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a progressive consultant and onetime aide to former Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Porter, meanwhile, says she\u2019s not focused on the ins and outs of the presidential race. But she would like her constituents to hear from as many candidates as possible ahead of California\u2019s March primary, which will take place three months earlier than when the balloting occurred in 2016, in order to increase the state\u2019s role in shaping the 2020 race. \u201cThere are a lot of delegates to be had in California, and in particular my area of Orange County \u2015 we just flipped it to the Democrats \u2015 so there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm there, and I would love to have candidates to come and visit,\u201d Porter said. \u201cAnd I would welcome any of them to do that.\u201d",

      "content": " Jonathan Van Ness\u00a0has endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in the 2020 Democratic primary. The 32-year-old revealed his HIV-positive status in a New York Times profile last week, ahead of the Sept. 24 release of his memoir. Then, during an interview\u00a0Wednesday, Van Ness told Build Series that he realized he had a \u201csignificant role to play\u201d and a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to support people living with HIV after publicly sharing his status. (Both Build Series and HuffPost are a part of Verizon Media.) \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m endorsing Senator Elizabeth Warren for president,\u201d the \u201cQueer Eye\u201d star said. He revealed that his support for her was cemented after a difficult experience seeking medication last month. Van Ness said he misplaced his daily HIV medication while he was traveling between New York and Philadelphia. \u201cI just was not thinking, so I left my medicine in New York City and I got to Philly and realized I didn\u2019t have my medication,\u201d he said. He visited a pharmacy late at night and, after dealing with his insurance company, had to pay $3,500 for the prescription. He was frustrated, both by the inconvenience of being unable to simply get a single replacement pill, and by the high cost, which he would have been unable to afford three years ago. \u201cHow the fuck do I have $3,500 sitting around in my fucking checking account?\u201d Van Ness added, noting three years ago \u2014 before he appeared on \u201cQueer Eye\u201d \u2014 his financial situation was much different. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that skipping dosages could give \u201cHIV the chance to multiply rapidly,\u201d which could weaken the immune system, and goes on to say that in most cases individuals who miss a dose can \u201ctake the medicines as soon as you can ... (unless your pharmacist or health care provider has told you something different).\u201d On Wednesday, Van Ness tweeted about his support for Warren, writing that health care \u201cshouldn\u2019t be for profit, ever, it\u2019s a human right.\u201d Van Ness then tweeted a video of a phone call he had with Warren, in which he describes how impressed he was with her remarks on health care at the Democratic debate on Sept. 12, where the candidate also discussed high\u00a0prescription drug costs. Warren supports the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal\u00a0introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), which would provide all Americans health care through the government. She has received some criticism for not releasing her own health care plan and, when\u00a0asked after the debate if\u00a0she is going to, Warren said, \u201cI support Medicare for All, I think it\u2019s a good plan. ... Other things that people have come up with, when they\u2019re good plans, let\u2019s do it. This isn\u2019t some kind of contest, \u2018I gotta think of mine first,\u2019 it\u2019s what best for the American people.\u201d In his Build Series interview, Van Ness addressed the dangers of HIV stigmatization, noting that there\u2019s \u201cso much more work to be done.\u201d He said he reads stories of people \u201cdying from HIV/AIDS-related deaths all over the world, due to lack of treatment, stigmatization, no access to facilities...\u201d \u201cIf I was in one of those places, the person that people love so much, the ball of sunshine ... If I was born 20 years before I was born there\u2019s a really good chance that I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said.",

I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\u201d He continued: Does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that\u2019s not the position that you want to be in \u2026 It\u2019s like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight. Warren responded to the disclosure by reiterating her plan to break up tech giants, tweeting Tuesday: \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d Facebook has repeatedly come under fire for privacy concerns, potential antitrust violations, its role in election interference and the dissemination of hate speech, online abuse and disinformation. Warren has called for big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon to be broken up,\u00a0warning of their threats to competition, privacy and free speech. \u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power\u200a \u2015 \u200atoo much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\u201d Warren wrote in March. \u201cWe need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\u201d Several other Democratic candidates have taken similar positions, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has said she would \u201cseriously take a look at\u201d breaking up Facebook, calling it \u201cessentially a utility that has gone unregulated.\u201d Part of Warren\u2019s plan would involve more regulation of \u201canti-competitive mergers,\u201d like Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram. \u201cUnwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market \u2015 which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy,\u201d Warren said in March. According to the leaked audio, Zuckerberg reassured employees that \u201cthe rule of law\u201d is on Facebook\u2019s side.

Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) closed the gap of support between her and former Vice President Joe Biden as the top contender for the presidential nomination in Iowa\u2019s Democratic caucuses, the first state in the country to vote in the race, according to the latest results of a key\u00a0poll in Iowa released Saturday night. In the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll, Warren was the first-choice candidate with support from 22% of likely Democratic caucus attendees \u2015 up 7 percentage points since the last poll in June. Biden, who has maintained a slight edge over his opponents in other polling, fell 3 percentage points, bringing him to second place with 20% of their support. According to the Register, support for Biden has fallen in the Iowa polls since last year. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is also running for the Democratic nomination, fell far behind both Warren and Biden in the Saturday\u2019s poll, taking third place at 11% \u2015 down 5 percentage points since June. All the other Democratic 2020 candidates polled in the single digits. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) rounded out the top five candidates, polling at 9% and 6% respectively. Despite Warren\u2019s and Biden\u2019s lead, there\u2019s still room for other contenders to crawl back up before the Iowa Democratic caucuses in February. Sixty-three percent of likely caucusgoers said in the poll that they hadn\u2019t fully made up their minds yet on their most favored candidates. Ann Selzer, the most respected pollster in the state, conducted the poll on 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers between Sept. 14 and Sept. 18. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Earlier Saturday, all of the 2020 Democratic candidates came together for an annual Steak Fry fundraiser for the Polk County Democrats in Des Moines. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article referred to Bernie Sanders as a Democratic senator from Vermont. Sanders was elected as an independent, though he caucuses with Democrats and is running for the Democratic presidential nomination.",

      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has a\u00a0plan to crack down on lobbying in Washington: She wants to institute a progressive tax on \u201cexcessive\u201d lobbying expenditures. The proposal from the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate was first listed among her proposals to rein in Washington lobbying in September, but she is now providing extensive details. She would place a 35% tax on annual lobbying expenses above $500,000 for corporations and trade organizations. The tax rate will increase to 60% for expenses over $1 million and then 75% for spending exceeding $5 million. The income generated by the new tax will be placed in a \u201cLobbying Defense Trust\u201d that will be used to help fund congressional support agencies, such as a reinstated Office of Technology Assessment and the Congressional Budget Office, and heavily lobbied executive branch agencies. It would also create an Office of the Public Advocate to help regular people better influence government decision-making. The general idea is that a tax on lobbying creates a market-based mechanism to discourage corporate spending that seeks to gain from making back-room deals rather than creating wealth. Currently, there is a strong incentive for corporations and other special interests to spend heavily on lobbying to obtain beneficial treatment. All combined,\u00a0more than $3 billion was spent on reported lobbying expenditures in each of the past 10 years. Corporations make up the largest share of this spending. Total revenue from the proposed lobbying tax would have raised $10 billion over the past 10 years, according to an analysis provided by the Warren campaign. Fifty-one corporations would have been hit with the highest proposed tax rate of 75% for spending above $5 million. These companies and trade groups include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Koch Industries, Exxon, Boeing, Microsoft, Pfizer, Walmart, Google and Facebook. The lobbying tax is one of many proposals Warren has introduced to crack down on corruption in Washington. She has proposed banning elected lawmakers and top officials from lobbying, expand the definition of lobbying to increase disclosure, ban foreign lobbying and ban lobbyists from donating or raising campaign money, among other things. The thinking behind Warren\u2019s tax on lobbying expenditures is slightly different \u2015 maybe even opposed to \u2015 the restrictions on lobbying usually considered by Congress. It can be argued that some of these restrictions have simply had the effect of making lobbying less transparent \u2015 as more people involved in the influence industry find loopholes to evade registering as lobbyists. The tax, however, is simply a mechanism to deter excessive lobbying \u2015 or at least impose a cost on it. This is what Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, thought when he proposed a tax on lobbying in his 2012 book, \u201dA Capitalism for the People.\u201d The Warren campaign consulted him when crafting the proposal. \u201cIf you tax lobbying in a progressive way then it reduces the influence of the largest companies on the important decisions,\u201d Zingales told The Economist in a 2012 interview. \u201cPeople lobby because there\u2019s a high return, but if you start taxing them and using some of that money to subsidise the opponents then it evens out.\u201d And that is Warren\u2019s thinking, too. \u201cMy new lobbying tax will make hiring armies of lobbyists significantly more expensive for the largest corporate influencers like Blue Cross Blue Shield, Boeing, and Comcast,\u201d Warren said in a post explaining the new tax policy. \u201cSure, this may mean that some corporations and industry groups will choose to reduce their lobbying expenditures, raising less tax revenue down the road \u2015 but in that case, all the better.\u201d",

      "content": " ROCK HILL, S.C. \u2015 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren came to historically Black Clinton College in this suburb of Charlotte hoping to woo the voters she needs to complete a coalition that can claim the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination: African Americans. Warren\u2019s slow and steady rise in polling has been largely powered by white voters with college degrees, though more recent polls have shown gains across basically every demographic within the Democratic Party. But one of her biggest rivals for the nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden, still has a substantial lead among African American voters nationally and in this crucial state, the first in the south to cast its primary ballots. Compared to Iowa and New Hampshire \u2015 the overwhelmingly white states that vote first and second in the primary \u2015 Warren has spent little time in South Carolina. A local reporter noted it had been more than a month since her last public event in the state, and a candidate tracker from the Charleston Post and Courier shows her attending just 12 events in the state before Saturday, compared to 17 for Biden, and more than 30 for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the third leading contender for the nomination. (Two African American candidates \u2015 California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker \u2015 lead the way with 36 and 39 events, respectively.) Warren\u2019s supporters in South Carolina say if she picks up her pace in visits to the state, African American voters will embrace her message of battling political corruption and raising taxes on the wealthy to fund universal child care and free public higher education. \u201cWe\u2019re still a high-touch community, even in a high-tech society,\u201d said state Sen. Wendy Brawley, an African American who predicted Warren could win the state. \u201cShe gets that she needs to show up where we are.\u201d Warren\u2019s stop at Clinton College showed the promises and challenges that face the former Harvard Law professor. The crowd of roughly 1,000 people was mostly white, and attendees of all races largely said they arrived at the event already in her corner. Warren\u2019s pitch barely varied from her standard stump speech: She walked voters through her famous policy plans while nearly totally avoiding two hot topics of the day \u2015 the possible impeachment of President Donald Trump and the details of her support for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d She did note her higher education plan would funnel an additional $50 billion to historically Black colleges like Clinton. It\u2019s not new for Warren to be courting African Americans. Some Black progressive activists have been raving about her since at least April, and she\u2019s often held listening sessions with Black leaders as she tours the country. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I\u2019m in this fight, what\u2019s broken and how to fix it,\u201d Warren told reporters when asked about the majority-white crowd and what she needed to do to win over Black voters. But it does appears Warren is ready to invest more time and resources in the state. She\u2019s opening a campaign office in Rock Hill next week, her campaign said. But while the Warren team is eager to talk up the strength of their field operations in Iowa and New Hampshire, they declined to reveal how many staffers are on the ground in the Palmetto State. (In total, Warren has 300 staffers, and 60% of those are in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada.) Biden\u2019s campaign has 41 staffers on the ground here. Brawley and other Warren backers in the state pointed to two Warren policies they believe could help court Black voters: Her education policies \u2014 including the elimination of student debt \u2014 could woo younger Black voters, while her proposal to make sure no family spends more than 7% of its income on childcare would attract Black women of all ages. \u201cIn my district, when you have grandparents raising their grands, when you have people working two jobs to keep a roof over their heads, not having childcare is a real issue,\u201d Brawley said. \u201cThese are pocketbook issues that really matter, that can change people\u2019s lives if we give them even a little attention.\u201d Casey McClure, a 26-year-old who said she \u201cloved everything about\u201d Warren, suggested Biden\u2019s lead in the state was due to a generation gap. \u201cIt\u2019s the older voters,\u201d she said, noting she had met Biden during one of his earlier stops in the state. \u201cShe needs to get the young people out to vote.\u201d But there are some signs the gap might be closing. \u201cI love Joe, but he might not be as spunky as he used to,\u201d said McClure\u2019s mother, who declined to give her name. A Quinnipiac University poll this week saw Warren essentially tied with Biden, and building beyond her base of college-educated white voters. She earned the support of 27% of Democrats and Democratic-learning voters nationally, compared to 25% for the former vice president, and 16% for Sanders. That included a lead among college-educated white voters, liberals, voters aged 35 to 50, and those making more than $50,000 a year. She also tied Biden among white voters without a college degree. Among white voters overall, Warren led Biden 33% to 23%. But among Black voters, Biden\u2019s advantage was substantial: Forty percent said they support him, while only 19% backed Warren. That still represents a marked improvement for Warren. In July, the same poll found just 4% of Black voters supported her, while 53% supported Biden. A CNN poll of South Carolina voters released Sunday morning, however, painted a much grimmer picture for Warren. The poll showed Biden earning 37% of the statewide vote to Warren\u2019s 16%, with Sanders at 11%. Among Black voters, Warren tallied just 4% of the vote compared to Biden\u2019s 45% and Sanders\u2019 13%. Biden and his allies have long viewed Black voters as a crucial backstop for his campaign. While Sanders turned in strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire in 2016, his campaign floundered as Hillary Clinton, the party\u2019s eventual nominee, routed him among African Americans. The primary schedule is similar this year. Fourteen states are holding their primaries on March 3, so-called Super Tuesday, when more than 40% of the Democratic delegates are up for grabs. Six of those states, including delegate-rich Texas, are at least 10% Black. But state Rep. Kambrell Garvin, another Warren backer, suggested Biden and others shouldn\u2019t count on South Carolina\u2019s voters to stay static, and noted the results in Iowa and New Hampshire could sway their votes. \u201cI know South Carolina for some of the other campaigns is considered to be a firewall state, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think African-American voters are not monolithic, and I think they\u2019re going to make decisions that best suit their community.\u201d",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " SAN DIEGO \u2015 A new poll confirms that a tight three-way race is developing in California\u2019s key Democratic presidential primary, with one candidate showing impressive momentum: Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. A\u00a0survey released Thursday by the Public Policy Institute of California showed\u00a0Warren the choice of 23% of likely primary voters, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 22% and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at 21%. When the Democratic race was first taking shape in the spring, a Quinnipiac Poll had shown Warren in single digits in the Golden State, far behind Biden, Sanders and California Sen. Kamala Harris. Indeed, as Warren\u2019s support has surged in California \u2015 as it has nationally \u2015 the prospects for Harris in her home state have taken a hit, again reflecting national trends. Perhaps the new poll\u2019s most striking finding is that Harris trailed well behind the pack with just 8% support, another sign of trouble for her struggling campaign. \u201cWarren may well be a beneficiary of Harris\u2019 collapse,\u201d said veteran California Democratic strategist Garry South. \u201cSince her very impressive debut (as a White House candidate) in Oakland in January, Harris has done little in California to solidify whatever support may have been potentially there for her.\u201d Voters like Cindy Henderson, an author who showed up to hear Warren speak Thursday as the candidate made her first campaign stop in San Diego, give a glimpse into the race\u2019s current dynamics. \u201cI was actually a Kamala fan,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cJust something in the last two or three months, I\u2019m just kind of dropping off [on her]. I think she\u2019s not quite ready. I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s much depth yet. The more I hear and watch what Elizabeth does, it\u2019s just like, OK, she\u2019s a rock star. I\u2019m loving her message.\u201d Warren drew about 8,500 people for her rally in downtown San Diego. (A rally for Sanders was attended by an estimated 6,400 people at the same venue in May). Like most of Warren\u2019s audiences, her Thursday crowd was predominantly white \u2015 which aligns with how her support breaks down in public opinion surveys, as well. A UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll\u00a0released in late September showed her leading the California race with 29%, with Biden at 21% and Sanders at 20%. But Warren trailed both of those two with Latino voters. Warren mostly stuck to her populist stump speech on Thursday, laying out her plans to take on Washington corruption, special interests and big corporations. She appeared to choke up at one point as she recalled the family struggles that marked her childhood in Oklahoma, including the time her mother lost her job. The story is a big hit with many voters, who cite it when discussing the candidate. At one point, after discussing her plan to break up big tech companies, Warren called out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who told employees in recently leaked audio the company would \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to defeat her efforts. \u201cAnd yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I\u2019m looking at you,\u201d she said, to cheers and applause from the audience. The true contours of the Democratic battle will emerge in February when the narrative-driving nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina take place. But right around the corner comes primaries in 14 states on March 3, Super Tuesday. And California is the day\u2019s dominant contest, with 416 convention delegates allotted. That\u2019s why so many of the main Democratic contenders are paying frequent visits to the state to meet with voters \u2015 as well as well-heeled donors. Also, early mail-in voting begins a month before the actual primary date. And conquering California presents unique challenges for a politician: its\u00a0population is decidedly more diverse than that in the earlier-voting states, campaign ads are far more expensive than in those other locales and gaining media attention is difficult. In terms of having the money to compete, Warren and Sanders are well-primed as the race enters the final stretch before primary season. Warren raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, her campaign told supporters in an email Friday, and has $25.7 million cash on hand. Sanders, hospitalized earlier this week in Nevada because of a blocked artery, raised $25.3 million from July to September (his campaign didn\u2019t release a cash-on-hand figure). Their figures are especially impressive because both candidates have opted against holding fundraisers focused on big-dollar donors during the primary campaign. Biden\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, reported a lackluster $15.2 million raised over the past three months, far less than his second-quarter haul of $21.5 million. He could be in trouble if his fundraising continues to taper off. President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee announced raising a combined $125 million in the third quarter, a record-setting haul. His war chest will only grow as Democrats spend several months \u2015 and maybe more, in the case of a lengthy primary battle \u2015 determining their nominee. Warren dismissed Trump\u2019s haul on Thursday, telling reporters she didn\u2019t think \u201cscooping up a bunch of money from rich people and buying a bunch of TV ads\u201d is \u201chow democracy works anymore.\u201d She added: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be about going out and building a grassroots movement.\u201d Given Warren\u2019s steady rise in the primary race, the Oct. 15 Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, looms particularly large for her. As the frontrunner in several of the race\u2019s most recent national polls, she\u2019ll likely have a bigger target on her back. Even as Warren received enthusiastic backing at her San Diego rally, interviews with some of the undecided voters at it underscored some of the doubts she still most overcome. Corinne Lytle-Bonine, an environmental consultant who voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary, acknowledged she was giving Warren a strong look this time around. \u201cHaving the nomination be another old white man is a hard pill to swallow when it feels like women have been the ones really carrying the Democrats through 2018,\u201d Lytle-Bonine said. She added that \u201cI think Warren has some establishment credentials that Bernie doesn\u2019t, and may make her more electable in the general election.\u201d Still, Lytle-Bonine questioned why Warren has been hesitant to acknowledge whether the middle class would see a tax hike if, as president, she would push into law \u201cMedicare-for-All\u201d government health care plan Sanders has introduced and that she supports. Several of Warren\u2019s rivals have criticized her for repeatedly dodging the question; she\u2019s brushed off the attacks as unfair Republican framing. \u201cI wish that she would\u201d directly deal with that issue, Lytle-Bonine said. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t know what is holding her back. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hard answer to say \u2018Yes, we\u2019ll raise taxes, however, all of your out-of-pocket expenses (for health care) go away.\u2019\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign is on the offensive against a report that questions a compelling piece of her origin story: her account of being pushed out of her first teaching job because she was six months pregnant. Although the reports don\u2019t contain evidence that Warren is lying, they show there is no written evidence she was fired from her elementary school job and they open the door to the possibility that she voluntarily resigned to raise a family. What\u2019s missing, though, is a crucial fact about the time period when Warren says she was shown the door: In 1971, teaching wasn\u2019t just another profession where women experienced pregnancy discrimination. It was the national model for how employers could systematically discriminate against pregnant workers and get away with it. School districts\u00a0around the country followed\u00a0plain-as-day policies that terminated pregnant teachers or forced them to take unpaid leave, usually around the fifth month of pregnancy when they were obviously pregnant. A National Education Association survey in 1970 found that\u00a0a majority of school districts had such a policy, and that most of those policies came with no guarantee that a teacher would get her job back after giving birth. That placed school teachers on the front lines of the fraught legal and cultural battles for better protections for working women, writes legal historian Deborah Dinner. National women\u2019s groups took up the treatment of pregnant teachers as an organizing cause. Women\u2019s legal advocates recruited teachers as civil rights test cases. The Supreme Court\u2019s first pregnancy discrimination case, argued in 1973, pitted three pregnant teachers against a \u201cfive month\u201d policy. That case, and the questions it left unanswered, became the basis for the landmark Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. In other words, when a pregnant Warren left her teaching job, pregnancy discrimination against teachers was rampant, controversial and inextricable from the much larger battle on the overall status of working women. The question isn\u2019t why her school board would lie about forcing her out \u2014 it\u2019s why wouldn\u2019t it? Warren\u2019s story of being shuffled out of her first teaching job goes like this:\u00a0In 1971, she was a teacher \u2014 her dream job \u2014 at a special-needs school for public school students at Riverdale Elementary in New Jersey. In April, when she was pregnant but not obviously, the school renewed her teaching contract for another year. By the summer, she was six months pregnant \u2014 \u201cvisibly pregnant\u201d \u2014 and the job was no longer hers. \u201cThe principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck, showed me the door, and hired someone else for the job,\u201d she said at a recent town hall. In some recent appearances, she has dropped the \u201cshowed me the door\u201d line, but she defended her characterization in an interview\u00a0with CBS News. \u201cWhen someone calls you in and says the job that you\u2019ve been hired for for the next year is no longer yours, \u2018We\u2019re giving it to someone else,\u2019 I think that\u2019s being shown the door,\u201d Warren said. The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative outlet, cast doubt by noting that Warren had once described her exit differently: \u201c[I] said, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me.\u2019 I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years,\u201d she said in a 2007 interview. (Warren told CBS that she wasn\u2019t comfortable opening up about the discrimination aspect until recently.) And it pointed to contemporaneous reports from 1971 that also paint her exit as voluntary. A local news item said Warren was \u201cleaving to raise a family,\u201d while another said the school board hired Warren\u2019s replacement after she \u201cresigned for personal reasons.\u201d Of course, what really matters here is whether Warren had a choice to keep her job at all. And to read just those two news items is to miss the reality that in 1971, it was the de facto or actual expectation in the majority of American school districts that a teacher who became pregnant would resign. \u201cVoluntary resignations\u201d were many teachers\u2019 only alternative to automatic dismissal \u2014 and Warren\u2019s school district was reportedly no exception. \u201cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn\u2019t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn\u2019t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,\u201d Trudy Randall, a retired Riverdale Elementary teacher, told CBS. \u201cBut they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.\u201d Certainly, by 1971, Warren\u2019s principal would have known that to openly fire her because she was pregnant was to court trouble. \u201cIn the early 1970s,\u201d the country at large was embroiled in a \u201cmajor cultural and legal debate over the rights of pregnant workers,\u201d according to a history of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism. The American Federation of Teachers denounced mandatory pregnancy dismissals at its annual convention in 1970. By the next year \u2014 the year Warren left her job \u2014 the federation and the National Organization for Women were coordinating local name-and-shame campaigns against school boards with retrograde policies. One district that found itself under fire was a school board in New Jersey, the state where Warren had worked. In 1972, the state civil rights commission slapped down a policy forcing teachers to leave school at five months pregnant. An Associated Press story from that time reported the ruling to mean \u201cpregnant teachers can no longer be automatically forced out of New Jersey\u2019s classrooms.\u201d Because teaching was one of a few career options reliably available to women, the treatment of pregnant schoolteachers was at the heart of the broader societal clash over pregnant workers.\u00a0Schools were also a special battleground because teaching jobs were mostly government jobs \u2014 it gave pregnancy discrimination against teachers the sheen of authority. Among the very first federal cases against pregnancy discrimination was brought in 1973, by a Minnesota teacher named Margo Seaman, who sued her school district for forcing her, when she was seven months pregnant, to take a semesterlong leave of absence. Seaman was able to stay in her job but lost her fight for back pay, in no small part because her teacher\u2019s union had capitulated in 1971 to a policy \u201cproviding for permanent \u2018termination\u2019 of a teacher after five months of pregnancy, with no guarantee of reinstatement.\u201d And in 1974, the Supreme Court took up its first pregnancy discrimination suit, which the legal professor Nicholas Pedriana\u00a0called \u201ca typical early pregnancy discrimination case\u201d: \u201cPublic school teachers who became pregnant were required to take maternity leave beginning in the fifth month of pregnancy.\u201d The case,\u00a0Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, involved three teachers from two school districts in Ohio and Virginia who were pregnant in 1970 or 1971 and were forced to take many months of unpaid maternity leave with no guarantee of getting their jobs back. In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the five-month rule was arbitrary and unconstitutional. The questions that case left unanswered \u2014 namely, whether pregnancy discrimination was a form of gender discrimination and subject to an even wider array of civil rights laws \u2014 led eventually to the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. At the heart of all of these legal fights and retrograde school board policies were traditional ideas about gender, Dinner writes: the notion that pregnancy, a visible sign of women\u2019s sexual activity, wasn\u2019t classroom-appropriate; that pregnant women couldn\u2019t work without endangering their health and their pregnancies; and that new mothers shouldn\u2019t work but focus on their families. Those ideas started to crumble in the 1970s. But they still persist, and, making it all the more difficult to dismiss Warren\u2019s story, they still result in routine pregnancy discrimination against professional women today. Today, the idea of putting a visibly pregnant CEO on the cover of a magazine is still considered trailblazing. Today, the idea that pregnant women place special burdens on their co-workers is still pervasive. Pregnant women often find themselves \u201cmommy tracked,\u201d and paid or promoted less than their peers for equivalent work based on the assumption that their futures belong to their families. \u201cPregnancy discrimination remains pervasive, especially for women in low-wage and physically demanding jobs,\u201d said Dina Bakst, co-founder and co-president of A Better Balance, a national legal advocacy organization for women\u2019s rights. \u201cIt is a key barrier to gender equality in the workplace, often snowballing into devastating economic consequences for women.\u201d And it is still prevalent in the teaching profession. Religious schools, for instance, have fought for and often won the legal right to fire pregnant teachers who are unmarried or who conceive using methods, like IVF, opposed by some faiths. Denine Hasan, who is a New Jersey schoolteacher like Warren was, said she wasn\u2019t at all surprised by Warren\u2019s account. Hasan says that she, too, was shuffled out of her position when she became pregnant \u2014 during the 2012-13 school year. Like Warren, she wasn\u2019t outright fired. Instead, she says, she was assigned to a new school, given unprecedented negative reviews and treated with hostility or punished when she asked for medically recommended accommodations for her high-risk pregnancy. Officials informed Hasan, who was not tenured, that her contract would not be renewed when she went on maternity leave. (The Asbury Park School District has not admitted wrongdoing, and didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.) \u201cI don\u2019t think I would get pregnant again. Because you\u2019re just fearful. What\u2019s going to happen? Am I going to lose my job?\u201d Hasan told HuffPost. \u201cWomen are always viewed differently than men,\u201d she continued. \u201cIts natural for us to bear children, and then to be put in situations where now we\u2019re losing jobs because we\u2019re doing something that\u2019s natural. It\u2019s like we can\u2019t win.\u201d Emily Peck contributed reporting",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is standing firm in the face of scrutiny, and so are her supporters, who are sharing their own stories on Twitter of when they faced discrimination because of pregnancy. The 2020 presidential candidate tweeted Tuesday to reiterate that she had been edged out of her first teaching job when she became pregnant. She had been responding to unsubstantiated accusations that she had actually voluntarily resigned. \u201cWe can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours,\u201d she added. The conservative website Washington Free Beacon on Monday surfaced the minutes from an April 1971 board of education meeting showing a unanimous vote to extend Warren\u2019s teaching contract, two months before her exit in June. This does not necessarily contradict Warren\u2019s story, which is that her contract was renewed in April but that by June, when she was six months\u2019 pregnant, the principal \u201cshowed her the door.\u201d \u201cWhen someone calls you in and says the job that you\u2019ve been hired for for the next year is no longer yours \u2015 \u2018We\u2019re giving it to someone else\u2019 \u2015 I think that\u2019s being shown the door,\u201d Warren told CBS News on Monday.

On Tuesday, after Warren\u2019s tweets, people on Twitter shared their own experiences of job discrimination due to pregnancy, or those of their friends and family. Here are some of those stories: Yep. In the late 90s, after 3 years of stellar reviews/promotions, I was suddenly fired within a month of telling my boss I was pregnant. They said I lied when I\u2019d called in sick one day (morning sickness), but went to visit family later. I was young+scared, so I didn\u2019t fight it.

      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0released a wide-ranging LGBTQ policy plan on Thursday morning, vowing to enact measures and funnel resources toward fighting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender expression. In a 12-page memo, the Massachusetts senator outlined dozens of ways a Warren administration would \u201cfight for LGBTQ+ equality in solidarity with the leaders and organizers who have been at the helm from the very beginning.\u201d The measures include things like working to pass the Equality Act, which would extend civil rights protections to LGBTQ people, and amending the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to ensure it can\u2019t be used to discriminate against LGBTQ people. Warren said she would reverse the Trump administration policy that bans transgender people from serving in the military, as well as appoint a special envoy to the State Department to oversee LGBTQ human rights. \u201cI have opposed the Trump Administration\u2019s shameful ban on transgender service members from the start, and I will reverse it on Day One,\u201d the senator wrote in her plan. Warren\u2019s plan highlights the recent murders of transgender people in the U.S., most of them trans women of color, and states \u201cit is time for a president to say their names and honor their memory.\u201d The senator included a number of measures aimed at reducing violence against trans women of color, including reversing the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s proposal to allow homeless shelters to deny transgender people access to their services. Warren released the plan ahead of her participation in a Thursday town hall hosted by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign that will focus on issues affecting the LGBTQ community. The senator is also expected to join the Las Vegas Pride Parade on Friday. Thursday\u2019s plan comes on the heels of a sweeping climate justice proposal Warren released on Wednesday and which reads as an ambitious blueprint of how to implement a Green New Deal. Like her LGBTQ plan, Warren\u2019s climate proposal looks at addressing the intersections of multiple issues \u2015 in this case how race and privilege play into conversations about the environment. \u201cJustice cannot be a secondary concern \u2015 it must be at the center of our response to climate change,\u201d Warren wrote in the memo.",

      "subtitle": "The Democratic 2020 presidential candidate is targeting misconduct in the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court.",
      "author": "",
      "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unveiled a plan to reform federal judicial misconduct on Monday, a day after the one-year anniversary of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s controversial confirmation to the Supreme Court. \u201cIt\u2019s time to ensure that judges do not hear cases where they have conflicts of interests, strengthen our nation\u2019s ethics rules for judges, and ensure accountability for judges who violate these rules,\u201d the 2020 presidential candidate wrote in her announcement of the plan for an impartial and ethical federal judiciary. Warren\u2019s plan includes closing a loophole that allows federal judges to escape investigations for misconduct when they resign from office or are elevated to the Supreme Court \u2015 a loophole that Warren has\u00a0railed against in the past. \u201cMy plan extends the authority of the Judicial Conference to former judges so that individuals under investigation cannot simply resign from the bench to avoid accountability,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThis provision would allow the judiciary to reopen the investigations into Alex Kozinski,\u00a0Maryanne Trump-Barry,\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh, and any other judge who benefited from this loophole.\u201d Kozinski was a judge on the federal 9th Circuit accused in 2017 by at least 15 law clerks of sexual misconduct. But, as Warren noted, the investigation into Kozinski\u2019s behavior was dropped when he retired. Trump-Barry, President Donald Trump\u2019s sister, resigned as a federal appellate judge in April, ending a probe into whether she violated judicial conduct rules by participating in the Trump family\u2019s alleged tax fraud schemes. When Kavanaugh rose to the Supreme Court, sexual assault and perjury complaints against him were dismissed. \u201cThe basic premise of our legal system is that every person is treated equally in the eyes of the law \u2015 including judges,\u201d Warren said on Monday. \u201cOur judiciary only functions properly when it lives up to this promise, and it risks eroding its legitimacy when the American people lose faith that judges are ethical and fair-minded.\u201d Warren also unveiled several proposals she hasn\u2019t mentioned publicly before. They include\u00a0prohibiting judges from deciding for themselves whether they should recuse themselves from a case due to conflict of interest;\u00a0requiring Supreme Court justices to give written explanations of their decisions when a party asks for a recusal; and\u00a0giving strong disciplinary tools to judicial ethics watchdogs, such as allowing them to take away nonvested pension benefits from judges. Warren\u2019s plan also proposes extending the Code of Conduct for United States Judges to the Supreme Court, which is currently not covered by such guidelines. Explaining the need for this provision, Warren cited the 83 ethics complaints\u00a0lodged against Kavanaugh that were dismissed upon his confirmation to the Supreme Court, as well as the lack of action after Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u00a0failed to disclose payments\u00a0his wife received from a conservative judicial activist group. \u201cBecause the Supreme Court is not covered by a Code of Conduct, no procedure exists to file new complaints\u201d against Kavanaugh, Warren said. She added that\u00a0\u201cquestions are often raised about the behavior of Supreme Court Justices, such as Justice Thomas\u2019s 13 years of financial disclosures that failed to list $690,000 in payments to his wife from the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing judicial activist group \u2015 but these actions are beyond the scope of current rules.\u201d Such lack of oversight, Warren said, has gone on for long enough. \u201cThese changes will not only allow us to ensure accountability for bad actors, including reopening inquiries into the conduct of offenders like Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey will also hold the vast majority of judges who act in good faith to the highest ethical standards, and in the process, begin to restore accountability and trust in a fair and impartial federal judiciary.\u201d Warren\u2019s plan comes almost exactly a year after the Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, following explosive allegations that he sexually assaulted at least three women when he was younger.",

      "author": "Alexander C. Kaufman",
      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren visited Michigan\u2019s most polluted ZIP code for the first time last week. The Massachusetts senator toured a community center and a school in the 48217 ZIP code in southwestern Detroit, where playgrounds sit sandwiched between the Great Lake State\u2019s only oil refinery and car manufacturing plants. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) guided the Sept. 29 visit, of which the campaign shared video with HuffPost. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d Warren says at the start of the video, turning to Tlaib in the backseat of an SUV. \u201cThat\u2019s what my people smell every day,\u201d the congresswoman says. \u201cI thought the smell was normal. I really did. I didn\u2019t realize that it was killing us.\u201d Just as gobbling fatty snacks at the Iowa State Fair is a rite of passage for top-tier presidential hopefuls, a pilgrimage to the 48217 is now becoming a touchstone for any contender who wants to be taken seriously on the nation\u2019s environment. Warren, citing a packed scheduled, passed on a chance to visit the area in July, when community activists invited all 20 candidates participating in the second round of Democratic primary debates in Detroit. Of the three who agreed to come \u2015 former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee \u2015 only Inslee, then running as the race\u2019s long-shot climate candidate, showed up. It was Inslee\u2019s third time in the 48217. Warren, a potential front-runner for the Democratic nomination, said she\u2019d adopt much of Inslee\u2019s book-length stack of climate proposals when the Evergreen State governor dropped out to run for reelection at home in August. Now she\u2019s covering the same ground, visiting the kind of frontline community that could lend her credibility as her campaign courts older Black voters, a key demographic to winning the nomination. The area, crisscrossed by highways and choked by air emissions, made a powerful backdrop for Warren just days after releasing a meaty proposal to restore union membership. The policy outline came out just as the United Auto Workers union was preparing for a long-haul strike against Detroit giant General Motors. After photographing legally questionable flaring \u2015 when excess gas is vented into the air and burned \u2015 at the Marathon Petroleum Corp. refinery next door to the Kemeny Recreation Center, Warren drove by Salina Elementary School, where Tlaib says officials only recently installed air filtration systems to protect students from cancer-causing particulate matter spewed from the neighboring AK Steel plant. \u201cThese big corporations have enough muscle with the government that they squeeze it to get tax breaks. So the cost of running these schools and keeping these roads paved fall disproportionately on you,\u201d Warren says to a trio of activists. \u201cSo you\u2019re not only paying the cost in terms of what you breathe, what your children breathe, your bodies \u2015 you\u2019re also paying the cost out of pocket.\u201d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A Democratic presidential race that had been largely static through the summer has tumbled into a chaotic fall, shaped by unpredictable events and the deepening impeachment crisis surrounding President Donald Trump. Less than four months before voting begins, front-running candidates are facing urgent questions about their ability to challenge Trump, prompted by a health scare for Sen. Bernie Sanders, an uneven response by Joe Biden to the president\u2019s efforts to tie him to the impeachment inquiry and nagging questions about liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2018s electability. Lower-tier candidates are struggling just to be heard. The uncertainty is heightening anxieties among Democrats desperate to defeat Trump in 2020. Although impeachment could imperil Trump\u2019s presidency, the process has also highlighted Trump\u2019s skill at discrediting his opponents, sometimes with baseless conspiracy theories. And Democrats appear no closer to sorting out what tactics, what ideology and what person is best-suited to overcome that. Progressive candidates like Sanders and Warren are surging in fundraising and drawing support from a wide swath of voters, according to polls, but face opposition from moderates who question whether now is the time to start the kind of sweeping \u2014 and divisive \u2014 economic and societal reforms they are pushing. It\u2019s a concern some moderates say has only increased against the backdrop of impeachment. \u201cThe divisions we have in the country threaten the health and stability of our democracy. President Trump has fractured so many norms,\u201d former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack said in an interview. \u201cLike a patient getting over an illness or injury, we have to first heal the nation\u2019s divisions and reestablish our norms before we have the needed strength to successfully embrace and implement an array of big ideas.\u201d Vilsack, a longtime friend of Biden\u2019s, has not endorsed anyone in the 2020 race. He\u2019s been courted by, and consulted with, numerous candidates, and has spoken regularly with Warren. The Massachusetts senator has energized voters with a menu of detailed policy proposals, a folksy, relatable way of explaining them and a swell of small-dollar donations that brought in more than $24.6 million in the most recent quarter. That\u2019s increasingly turning her into a target for candidates who see her calls for overhauling health care and rebalancing wealth in America as outside the mainstream. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is trying to break into the upper rung, has focused in particular on Warren\u2019s health care plan, the Sanders\u2019-authored \u201cMedicare for All\u201d single-payer system that Buttigieg describes as a \u201cmy-way-or-the-highway approach.\u201d But it\u2019s more than the policy Buttigieg is arguing against. \u201cWe have to be able not only to thrill a debate audience or a Twitter following but actually make something happen, which tells us that having the smartest policy is only half the battle when it comes to what will actually make a difference,\u201d Buttigieg said in an interview. For now, Warren advisers are happy to have Sanders still in the race to help absorb those blows rather than becoming the sole target of the attacks. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s good for Warren and Sanders to have each other in the race,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cThey bolster each other\u2019s ideas.\u201d The confidence Sanders\u2019 campaign felt last week after announcing a $25.3 million haul in the third quarter \u2014 the highest in the race \u2014 was lessened after the 78-year-old senator suffered a heart attack. He told reporters this week that he planned to scale back his campaign, then said he had misspoken. He\u2019ll return to the campaign on Tuesday for a debate in Ohio. His advisers privately acknowledge that the timing of the heart attack \u2014 which came just as the impeachment inquiry was escalating \u2014 may have helped limit the political fallout because attention was focused elsewhere. But they also understand that he will have to more directly address lingering health concerns. Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 chief strategist, dismissed any long-term concerns, noting that the 2020 contest includes several older candidates, including the 73-year-old Trump. \u201cThere are a number of older candidates in the race, including the sitting president of the United States, and I can tell you with confidence, there\u2019s only one we can say with assurance whose arteries are completely open,\u201d Weaver said, referencing the stent procedure designed to clear Sanders\u2019 clogged arteries. Biden, 76, stands as the strongest obstacle to Warren and Sanders, fundamentally opposed on policy and pitching a more conciliatory approach to governing. The former vice president was already facing questions about whether he was out of step with the party\u2019s activist liberal base and up for the challenge of taking on Trump before he got pulled into the impeachment inquiry, which centers on Trump\u2019s push for Ukraine to investigate the former vice president and his son. Although Trump\u2019s allegations against Biden are so far without foundation, the president and his allies have aggressively pressed the charges. Biden responded forcefully this week, but only after days of hand-wringing among supporters and advisers who worried he appeared ill-prepared for combatting the kind of asymmetrical political warfare at which Trump excels. Still, Biden backers contend that the mere fact that Trump has appeared focused on trying to take down Biden allows the former vice president to strengthen his electability argument by previewing what a one-on-one race with the president would look like. \u201cHe\u2019s able to go out there every day and make this Biden vs. Trump argument,\u201d said John Anzalone, a pollster for Biden. That\u2019s the fear for some lower-tier candidates \u2014 that the head-to-head fight between Trump and Biden, and the grassroots support of Warren and Sanders, block out their opportunities for a late surge. Everyone is at risk, including those who have had flashes of success in recent months but are now languishing in the single digits in many polls, including California Sen. Kamala Harris, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Buttigieg said there is no secret strategy for those candidates seeking to break out during this intense fall stride toward the first votes other than engaging in a \u201crespectful and robust\u201d debate of ideas. \u201cWhere there\u2019s an important difference, people need to understand that,\u201d he said.",

      "subtitle": "The Democratic presidential hopeful is adopting much of what former candidate Jay Inslee put out.",
      "author": "Alexander C. Kaufman",
      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren released a sweeping climate justice plan on Wednesday morning, vowing to ramp up research on the health effects of pollution and discourage the transfer of public water services to for-profit companies. The 12-page memo marks the Massachusetts senator\u2019s eighth climate-related proposal since launching a presidential campaign built on an ambitious slate of policy plans at the start of the year. The latest proposal collects much of Warren\u2019s existing ideas on improving racial equity and reducing pollution and reframes them in what looks like an ambitious, nearly 5,900-word blueprint on how to implement a Green New Deal. \u201cJustice cannot be a secondary concern \u2015 it must be at the center of our response to climate change,\u201d Warren wrote in the memo. \u201cThe Green New Deal commits us to a \u2018just transition\u2019 for all communities and all workers. But we won\u2019t create true justice by cleaning up polluted neighborhoods and tweaking a few regulations at the EPA.\u201d The document borrows heavily from the plan laid out by former climate candidate Jay Inslee, who quit the Democratic presidential primary in August to run for reelection as Washington\u2019s governor, including efforts to quantify pollution inequity between communities and apply that data to decisions on where to invest Green New Deal money. Warren also proposes turning the White House\u00a0Council on Environmental Quality, a currently sleepy office tasked with coordinating public health policy across federal agencies, into an environmental justice hub. The Warren plan offers fewer wonky details on which agencies should do what work than the Inslee proposal did. But notably included in the senator\u2019s release are calls to increase research funding at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to overhaul drinking water infrastructure, putting an end to the privatization of water delivery. Under her administration, Warren would \u201cfully fund\u201d the CDC\u2019s \u201cenvironmental health programs, such as childhood lead poisoning prevention, and community health investigations\u201d and would \u201cprovide additional grant funding for independent research into environmental health effects.\u201d Her campaign declined to share an exact dollar figure. It\u2019s a relatively novel idea to include the CDC in a campaign climate plan, something the other leading environmental champions in the race have omitted so far. Yet it\u2019s likely to be popular. In February, representatives from four dozen public health groups sent a letter to House lawmakers pleading for an increase in federal funding for the CDC\u2019s \u201ccritically underfunded\u201d lead and climate programs. The CDC is the fourth-most favorably viewed federal agency and has some of the most bipartisan support, a Pew Research Center poll found in September. Yet the CDC\u2019s operating budget fell nearly $1 million between the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years. Warren\u2019s plan goes beyond just researching the effects of lead poisoning. Citing the recent lead contaminations in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan, and Newark, New Jersey, she said her administration would \u201cend decades of disinvestment and privatization of our nation\u2019s water system \u2015 our government at every level should invest in safe, affordable drinking water for all of us.\u201d Ramping up federal spending on water infrastructure is a staple of Democratic campaigns at this point, particularly as Newark\u2019s former mayor, now-Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), is running for the presidential nomination. But curtailing the transfer of control of public services from government agencies to private companies is another issue altogether. The private water industry serves 73 million Americans, according to National Association of Water Companies data. For-profit water services put public health at risk, a 66-page paper by University of Louisville law professor Craig Anthony Arnold argues, because the profit motive incentivizes companies to provide better services to customers who pay more and to maintain infrastructure with an eye to the length of the firm\u2019s contract. Detroit\u2019s debt-choked public utility threatened to shut off water to nearly 17,500 households that were behind on bills last year, only to decrease the shutoff rate 70% this year. In the timing of the 2018 shutoffs, just as the city was looking to privatize its utility, the left-wing think tank Centre for Research on Globalization saw\u00a0an effort to streamline a troubled facility before selling it off to profiteers. Other cities are actively opposing such privatization. Last November, Baltimore became the first big city in the United States to ban water privatization with an amendment to its charter. Wednesday\u2019s proposal did not make clear whether a Warren White House would take explicit steps to discourage municipalities from switching to private water. But the campaign said an influx of federal funding to overhaul water infrastructure should make switching to private water services far less appealing. Income and race are strong indicators of how much pollution exposure Americans can expect to face. Black neighborhoods, on average, have air that\u2019s 48% more polluted than that in white neighborhoods, an NAACP report found last year, and Black Americans are 75% more likely to live in neighborhoods abutting industrial sites. The journal Environmental Research published a study last year that determined Black, Hispanic and poor students face the highest risks of inhaling toxic pollutants in crumbling schools across the country.",

Now, they\u2019re deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. It\u2019s time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable.\u201d Facebook drew ire this week for refusing to pull an ad that makes false accusations about former Vice President Joe Biden, who is one of Warren\u2019s opponents in the Democratic presidential nominating contest. The platform has also faced heavy scrutiny over the\u00a0role it played in the widespread dissemination of misinformation\u00a0about candidates including Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. In audio that leaked last week, Zuckerberg said he was prepared to \u201cgo to the mat and ... fight\u201d lawmakers such as Warren who are keen to break up big technology companies. Warren, meanwhile, this week called out Facebook\u2019s \u201cincredible power to affect elections and our national debate\u201d in a lengthy Twitter thread, below: Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister of the U.K. who is now Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs and communications, said last month that the company didn\u2019t believe \u201cit\u2019s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician\u2019s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why Facebook exempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program. We have had this policy on the books for over a year now, posted publicly on our site under our eligibility guidelines,\u201d he added. \u201cThis means that we will not send organic content or ads from politicians to our third-party fact-checking partners for review. However, when a politician shares previously debunked content including links, videos and photos, we plan to demote that content, display related information from fact-checkers, and reject its inclusion in advertisements.\u201d",

      "content": " More than two-thirds of the way into the Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday night, former Vice President Joe Biden took a casual swipe at his rivals without specifying whom he was speaking about exactly. \u201cWe can\u2019t be running any vague campaigns. We\u2019ve got to level with people,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I\u2019m the only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done.\u201d When a CNN moderator pressed Biden to clarify which candidates he thought were being vague, he pointed first to his left at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and then to his right, at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), claiming they were both obfuscating about the cost of \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d What happened next was the most direct and contentious exchange among the three candidates \u2015 the septuagenarian trio leading in the public polls \u2015 thus far in the primary. Sanders and Warren both took Biden to task for what they argued were either policy mistakes that hurt ordinary people or exaggerations of his role in the passage of positive reforms. Sanders began by seizing on Biden\u2019s insistence that he alone had shepherded \u201canything really big\u201d into law. He drew a no-holds-barred contrast with Biden\u2019s record on war, trade and bankruptcy reform, aiming to expose him as a false populist. \u201cJoe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend \u2015 you got the disastrous war in Iraq done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country, you got trade agreements, like NAFTA, PNTR with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.\u201d Sanders and Biden subsequently had a brief back-and-forth about Medicare for All, with Biden insisting that adopting a single-payer system was not necessary for achieving universal coverage. Then it was Warren\u2019s turn to answer Biden\u2019s implicit charge that she is vague and impractical. She focused on her brainchild: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. \u201cFollowing the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, \u2018Don\u2019t even try because you will never get it passed,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd sure enough, the big banks fought us, the Republicans fought us, some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law.\u201d Warren promised to leverage her knowledge from that fight to use every lever in her power as president, including executive actions, to enact \u201cstructural reform.\u201d \u201cI know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money and repeal the filibuster.\u201d Biden tried to share in the credit for passing the law that created the CFPB. \u201cI agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill!\u201d he declared. \u201cI convinced people to vote for it, so let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Warren wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,\u201d she responded, notably omitting Biden\u2019s name.

Read live updates on the debate below.\u00a0(You may need to refresh the page to see the latest updates.) 11:08 p.m. ET And that\u2019s a wrap for the fourth Democratic presidential primary debate. Thanks for following along, and be sure to check out even more coverage on HuffPost. \u2015 Paige Lavender 11:02 p.m. ET Also missing tonight: Questions on immigration. \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 10:54 p.m. ET Sanders and Castro both mentioned homelessness of their own accord,\u00a0but there were no questions tonight about affordable housing. The lack of affordable housing is a nationwide crisis. On a given day in January 2018, more than 500,000 people were homeless in the U.S. Trump went on a tear last month about homelessness in California, which has one of the highest rates of homelessness in the U.S., and complained about how people living in tents were ruining the \u201cprestige\u201d of San Francisco and Los Angeles. \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 10:53 p.m. ET Klobuchar says her most surprising friendship was with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, whom she says she misses \u201cevery day.\u201d She shares a quote from him: \u201cThere is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.\u201d \u2015 Nina Golgowski 10:50 p.m. ET Castro says he agrees with Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 message of practicing kindness but that he also believes we should hold people accountable for what they have done. \u201cI think we can do both things,\u201d he says. \u2015 Nina Golgowski 10:47 p.m. ET The final question of the night is about... Ellen DeGeneres? She caused a stir last week after being spotted palling around with former President George W. Bush at an NFL game. She was criticized for joking with Bush, and then fiercely defended her friendship with him on her show. Despite the cultural relevance, it feels like a weird question to end a debate that had zero questions about climate change. \u2015 Paige Lavender 10:44 p.m. ET Biden accuses Warren of pursuing vague ideas. Warren responds by touting the Obama administration\u2019s push for the consumer protection agency she recommended. \u201cI convinced people to vote for it,\u201d Biden says to Warren, who then thanks Barack Obama. Biden interjects, telling Warren she did a \u201chell of a job at your job.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren replies \u2015 coolly. \u2015 Ja\u2019han Jones 10:42 p.m. ET Warren and Sanders make the pitch for their \u201cbold\u201d policy plans over more centrist reform policies. Warren says: \u201cPeople who are struggling to pay health care are fighting today. ... People who are getting stopped by police because of the color of their skin are in a fight today. ... Anybody who doesn\u2019t understand that Americans are already in these fights is not in a position to win them.\u201d Sanders says: \u201cWe need bold action if we\u2019re gonna save this planet. \u2026 The way you win an election in this time in history is not with the same old, same old.\u201d \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 10:33 p.m. ET Biden tries to tout his accomplishments, saying, \u201cI\u2019m the only one on this stage who has actually gotten anything really big done.\u201d Sanders is not having it. \u201cYou know what you also got done? \u2015 and I say this as a good friend \u2015 you got the disastrous war in Iraq done,\u201d Sanders says. \u2015 Paige Lavender 10:32 p.m. ET In response to a rare debate question about packing the Supreme Court, Biden and Castro say they would not pack the court and Buttigieg floats the idea of term limits for justices. \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 10:29 p.m. ET Harris, Booker, Gabbard, Biden and Warren all say they would codify Roe v. Wade to protect reproductive rights. It\u2019s pointed out that they\u2019re in Ohio, one of several states that has banned abortions after just six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 policies that Booker likens to \u201cpeople trying to punish poverty,\u201d considering how wealthier women typically have the means to circumvent state abortion bans. \u2015\u00a0Sara Boboltz 10:23 p.m. ET For the first time this primary season, the moderators ask a question about abortion and reproductive rights. \u2015 Paige Lavender 10:21 p.m. ET Yang, on data rights, says, \u201cRight now our data is worth more than oil.\u201d He questions when Americans received an actual check in the mail for it. \u2015 Nina Golgowski 10:16 p.m. ET Harris urges her fellow contenders to \u201cjoin\u201d her in calling for Trump to be removed from Twitter. Read more on her calls for the company to suspend the president\u2019s account. \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 10:14 p.m. ET Steyer touts his business success as an advantage over Trump in 2020. He says Democrats need a candidate who can show Trump to be \u201ca failure as a businessperson, and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the American economy.\u201d \u2015 Ja\u2019han Jones 10:12 p.m. ET Booker, speaking as \u201cthe only vegan on the stage,\u201d argues against questioning any of the Democratic candidates about their health, saying Trump is the unhealthiest person running for president in 2020. \u2015 Paige Lavender 10:11 p.m. ET Yang criticizes Warren\u2019s plan to break up giant tech companies such as Google in the name of enforcing antitrust laws. He says political leaders \u201chave to be realistic that competition doesn\u2019t solve all the problems.\u201d Then, a zinger: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason nobody\u2019s using Bing today. Sorry, Microsoft, but it\u2019s true. So it\u2019s not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses across the country.\u201d \u2015\u00a0\u00a0Sara Boboltz 10:08 p.m. ET Gabbard, a 38-year-old military combat veteran, would be the youngest president, if elected. When asked about it, she argues that it\u2019s \u201cnot fair\u201d to question the oldest three candidates about their health and fitness and not the other candidates. \u2015 Nina Golgowski 10 p.m. ET Front-runners Biden, Sanders and Warren were all asked questions about their age. Biden says, \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience,\u201d and points to his yearslong record in the Obama White House and the \u201cwisdom\u201d that comes with years. Warren comes out strong: \u201cI will out-work, out-organize and out-last anyone \u2015 and that includes Donald Trump or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.\u201d \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 9:58 p.m. ET As O\u2019Rourke talks about medical marijuana\u2019s potential to help alleviate Americans\u2019 dependence on opioid medications, Yang offers some commentary. \u201cYes! Preach, Beto!\u201d he shouts, turning his gaze up to the ceiling. \u2015\u00a0Sara Boboltz 9:57 p.m. ET When asked about his recent heart attack, Sanders insists he\u2019s healthy and invites people to an upcoming rally. He thanks people for their prayers and well-wishes while he was hospitalized. \u2015 Paige Lavender 9:55 p.m. ET O\u2019Rourke agrees with Yang on decriminalizing opioid use and touts medical marijuana as an alternative treatment for patients. Here\u2019s more from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan on legalizing marijuana nationwide\u00a0and what weed company owners in Oakland, California, told him last month about his plan. \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 9:52 p.m. ET Steyer and Yang both blame big corporations and a lack of oversight from the government for the opioid crisis. Yang goes a step further, arguing safe injection sites should be open around the country and opioid addicts should be referred to counseling and rehab instead of prison. He also repeats an argument he\u2019s made before that opiates should be decriminalized for personal use. \u2015 Paige Lavender 9:48 p.m. ET Klobuchar says the people who should pay for treatment for those affected by the opioid epidemic are the people \u201cwho got them hooked and killed in the first place.\u201d \u2015 Nina Golgowski 9:46 p.m. ET Castro brings Atatiana Jefferson into the gun violence debate, saying, \u201cPolice violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.\u201d Read more about the officer, who has been charged with murder. \u2015\u00a0Sara Boboltz 9:44 p.m. ET Booker and Harris assume roles they\u2019ve assumed in previous debates, speaking \u2015 solitarily \u2015 about gun violence as it relates to Black communities, which experience gun death disproportionately. \u201cThe leading cause of death of young Black men in America is gun violence,\u201d Harris says. \u2015 Ja\u2019han Jones 9:41 p.m. ET Booker, Buttigieg and O\u2019Rourke go at it again on gun control, with O\u2019Rourke arguing for a mandatory assault weapons buyback and Buttigieg responding to O\u2019Rourke: \u201cI do not need lessons from you on courage \u2015 political or personal.\u201d Booker jumps in to mention the issue of everyday gun violence. Read more from their arguments online earlier this week. \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 9:39 pm. ET Klobuchar, addressing foreign interference in our elections, highlights her Honest Ads Act that would prohibit social media companies from running paid political ads without disclosing the sponsor. She adds that paper ballots need to be available in every voting precinct. \u2015 Nina Golgowski 9:38 p.m. ET Proving that women can tell corny jokes, too, Klobuchar cracks one about foreign interference in the 2016 election: \u201cThis wasn\u2019t \u2018meddling.\u2019 That\u2019s what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she\u2019s doing.\u201d She adds: \u201cSorry.\u201d \u2015\u00a0Sara Boboltz 9:34 p.m. ET O\u2019Rourke dodges a question about how he would enforce a mandatory gun buyback, an idea he floated in the last presidential debate. \u201cI expect my fellow Americans to follow the law,\u201d he says, arguing \u201cwe don\u2019t go door to door\u201d to enforce any law in the U.S. He argues certain weapons should be considered \u201ctoo dangerous to sell,\u201d and by that logic, \u201ctoo dangerous to own.\u201d \u2015 Paige Lavender 9:28 p.m. ET O\u2019Rourke says: Because the U.S. turned its back on the Kurds, \u201cit makes it more likely that we will have to send another generation of soldiers to fight our battles there.\u201d \u2015 Nina Golgowski 9:25 p.m. ET Castro says Trump has made a \u201ctotal disaster in Syria.\u201d He also draws a line between what\u2019s happening there and the Trump administration\u2019s border policies. \u201cThis president is caging kids on the border and letting ISIS prisoners run free,\u201d he says. \u2015 Paige Lavender 9:24 p.m. ET Harris on Trump\u2019s volatility in the middle east: \u201cDude gotta go, and when I\u2019m commander in chief we will stop this madness.\u201d \u2015 Ja\u2019han Jones 9:23 p.m. ET Several of the candidates call out Trump for reversing yearslong policy by withdrawing troops from Syria, saying it sends a signal to allies that the U.S. can\u2019t be trusted. Buttigieg, who served in the military, says when he was deployed, one of the things \u201ckeeping me safe\u201d was that the U.S. flag on his uniform was trusted. Sanders says: \u201cWhat country in the world will trust the word of the United States?\u201d \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 9:19 p.m. ET A few moments later, Gabbard (a veteran) tries to get Buttigieg (another veteran) to say he supports endless wars, as he shakes his head and visibly sighs. The mayor responds: \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria is keeping our word. Part of what gets people to put their lives on the line to work with us is to stand by our word.\u201d \u2015\u00a0Sara Boboltz 9:17 p.m. ET Gabbard addresses conflict in the Middle East, taking time to call claims she is a \u201cRussian asset\u201d and Bashar Assad apologist \u201ccompletely despicable.\u201d After saying both parties are responsible for the conflict in the region, Gabbard vows to end U.S. involvement in \u201cregime change.\u201d \u2015 Ja\u2019han Jones 9:13 p.m. ET Biden says Trump withdrawing troops from Syria is the \u201cmost shameful thing\u201d he\u2019s ever seen in foreign policy. \u201cThis is shameful, shameful what this man has done,\u201d Biden says. Read more about Trump\u2019s decision and reactions to it. \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 9:10 p.m. ET Steyer\u2019s campaign releases a statement arguing that he was the first presidential candidate to call for a wealth tax \u2015 back in October of 2018. \u201cUnder my own proposal,\u201d he says, \u201cI would pay more than an additional $10 million annually in taxes and have also called for closing the carried interest tax loophole.\u201d \u2015 Nina Golgowski 9:06 p.m. ET Castro makes the second mention of homelessness of the night, saying he\u2019s visited homeless people in Las Vegas who are sleeping \u201cin the shadows of hotels worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at his visit to homeless encampments in Oakland, California, last month. \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 9:05 p.m. ET Booker chimes in with a call for unity: \u201cTearing each other down because we have a different plan, to me, is unacceptable.\u201d \u2015\u00a0Sara Boboltz 9:03 p.m. ET Yang criticizes Warren for her plan to tax wealth, arguing that a value-added tax \u2015 similar to ones implemented in Germany and Denmark \u2015 are more suitable for the United States. \u201cIf we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search,\u201d he says, billions of dollars will be funneled to them. \u2015 Ja\u2019han Jones 9:01 p.m. ET \u201cThe rich are not like you and me,\u201d Warren says, noting that a wealth tax would yield more than an income tax. (She plans to introduce a wealth tax.) \u201cThe really, really billionaires are making money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing. ... I think that as democrats we will succeed when we dream big and fight hard.\u201d Klobuchar has harsh words for Warren in response, slamming her rival\u2019s progressive, detailed policies. \u201cI think simply because you have big ideas doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re fighting for regular people,\u201d Klobuchar says. \u2015 Sara Boboltz 8:59 p.m. ET Harris touts her proposed tax credits for lower-income Americans as a solution to poverty and income inequality. She mentions her single mother who raised her and her sister, saying she would put them to bed and then \u201csit up at the kitchen table trying to figure out how to make it all work.\u201d \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 8:52 p.m. ET Sanders talks about the need to raise taxes on billionaires, saying it\u2019s an \u201coutrage\u201d that a handful of the richest Americans make more than the bottom one-third of Americans. He also makes the first mention of homelessness on stage tonight, lamenting the \u201chalf a million Americans sleeping out on the street today.\u201d Steyer then chuckles when the moderator points out he\u2019s the only billionaire on the stage. \u201cThere have been 40 years when corporations have bought this government,\u201d Steyer says. \u201cThe results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says. It\u2019s absolutely wrong, and it\u2019s absolutely undemocratic and unfair.\u201d He then touts his wealth tax. Warren jumps in. \u201cWhy does everyone on this stage think it\u2019s more important to protect billionaires than to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d she asks. \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman and Sara Boboltz 8:48 p.m. ET General Motors, whose workers are currently striking in the biggest auto industry work stoppage in decades, prompts a discussion about unions and living wages. HuffPost\u2019s Dave Jamieson has more on the GM strike here. \u2015 Paige Lavender 8:46 p.m. ET Booker takes a swipe at Yang\u2019s universal basic income platform, saying it\u2019d be better to raise the minimum wage and put \u201cthe dignity back in work.\u201d \u2015 Nina Golgowski 8:43 p.m. ET Castro, like Sanders, says he would create jobs by investing in infrastructure and a Green New Deal. \u2015 Nina Golgowski 8:41 p.m. ET Warren reiterates her argument that corporate greed, not automation, is the leading cause of job loss in the U.S. She argues for greater worker representation on corporate boards and stronger unions. \u2015 Ja\u2019han Jones 8:39 p.m. ET Booker quotes Yogi Berra and says he\u2019s \u201chaving deja vu all over again\u201d listening to his peers debate health care and Hunter Biden. He also argues women shouldn\u2019t be the only ones fighting for reproductive rights. \u2015 Paige Lavender 8:38 p.m. ET Sanders vows to put Americans to work by fixing infrastructure, hiring more teachers, canceling student debt, and creating 20 million jobs through his proposed Green New Deal. \u2015 Nina Golgowski 8:36 p.m. ET Harris jumps into the fierce debate on health care to call attention to the issue of women\u2019s reproductive health. She says there has been \u201cnot nearly one word\u201d on the topic during previous debates, even as there is a \u201cfull-on attack\u201d on abortion access in some states. \u201cPoor women, women of color will die. \u2026 People need to keep their hands off of women\u2019s bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives,\u201d Harris says, to loud cheers. \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 8:29 p.m. ET Sanders hits back amid a fierce debate on stage on \u201cMedicare for All\u201d: \u201cAs somebody who wrote the damn bill \u2026 premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone. ... The overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills.\u201d He also adds that \u201cit is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.\u201d \u2015 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 8:27 p.m. ET Buttigieg, taking his first swipe at Warren over her support for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d says the senator has a plan for everything except how to pay for her health care bill. \u2015 Ja\u2019han Jones 8:26 p.m. ET Asked to clarify whether her health care plan will raise taxes for the middle class, Warren says she won\u2019t sign a bill into law \u201cthat does not lower costs for middle-class families.\u201d \u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy and big corporations; for hardworking middle-class families costs will go down,\u201d she says. \u2015 Paige Lavender 8:23 p.m. ET Biden answers a question on his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings with Ukraine while Biden was vice president.
