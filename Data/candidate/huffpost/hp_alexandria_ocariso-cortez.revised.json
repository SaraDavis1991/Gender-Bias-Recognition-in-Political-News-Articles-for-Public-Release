      "content": " Sarah Huckabee Sanders left her position as White House press secretary last week, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from her most recent tweet. Huckabee Sanders attacked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Twitter Sunday, continuing the fierce defense of President Donald Trump that defined her tenure as press secretary. \u201c[Ocasio-Cortez] is wasting your time on Twitter while destroying jobs in NY,\u201d Huckabee Sanders wrote. \u201cThank you for reminding Americans everyday why they elected Trump.\u201d Her tweet came in response to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s criticism of the president\u2019s decision to bring his daughter, Ivanka Trump, to the G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan, which brought together leaders from across the globe. \u201cIt may be shocking to some, but being someone\u2019s daughter actually isn\u2019t a career qualification,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said after a video surfaced showing an awkward interaction between Trump\u2019s eldest daughter and a number of world leaders. \u201cThe US needs our President working the G20. Bringing a qualified diplomat couldn\u2019t hurt either.\u201d Huckabee Sanders\u2019 time at the White House was defined by verbal attacks on journalists and a defense of the president that often meant standing by his lies. Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report revealed that Huckabee Sanders lied to reporters in 2017 about former FBI director James Comey\u2019s firing. She falsely told the public that the FBI had \u201clost confidence\u201d in Comey, later admitting that the claim had been fabricated. On another occasion, Huckabee Sanders tweeted a doctored video from the far-right conspiracy website InfoWars to justify a White House ban on CNN reporter Jim Acosta. Since stepping down from her position, Huckabee Sanders is considering a run for governor in her home state of Arkansas \u2014 a move which Trump has openly supported. If she launches a campaign, she will likely work closely with the president once again.",

      "content": " While there\u2019s no way\u00a0Megan Rapinoe, co-captain of the U.S. women\u2019s national soccer team, will visit the \u201cfucking White House,\u201d she accepted an invitation Friday from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY.) to tour the House of Representatives. The invitation for the team was issued via Twitter by the congresswoman. The star midfielder responded: \u201cConsider it done!\u201d Rapinoe added a party-face emoji blowing a noise-maker. AOC\u2019s invitation was linked to an ESPN story about the team\u2019s\u00a02-1 victory over France in the quarterfinals of the Women\u2019s World Cup. Rapinoe scored both goals. The team will now meet England in the semifinals. That\u2019s bound to infuriate President Donald Trump, who found out last week that Rapinoe would not accept a team invitation to the White House to meet Trump, whom she has called a racist and a misogynist. Trump answered by taunting her on Twitter, saying she should \u201cWIN\u201d before talking about an invitation (she was responding to a reporter\u2019s question). He also scolded:\u00a0\u201cMegan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag.\u201d Rapinoe, who is gay, has refused to sing the national anthem and doesn\u2019t put her hand over her heart at the World Cup games as her protests of Trump\u2019s policies. Rapinoe stood by her comments\u00a0at a news conference in Paris (though she said she\u2019s shouldn\u2019t have used the expletive, which upset her mom). Rapinoe said the Trump administration \u201cdoesn\u2019t fight for the same things we fight for.\u201d The team hasn\u2019t been invited to the White House, but Trump tweeted that he planned to invite the team whether they win the cup or not. Twitter fans celebrated the big win \u2014 and the connection between Ocasio-Cortez and Rapinoe. pic.twitter.com/7PUUWASyG4",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " PHILADELPHIA \u2015 Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, offered some qualified criticism Friday of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s disparaging comments about some of Jayapal\u2019s progressive colleagues, even as she defended Pelosi\u2019s overall leadership style. \u201cI don\u2019t think those comments were helpful to a broader picture of how we build progressive power in the House and what it looks like relative to overall Democratic power,\u201d she said during a panel discussion at the liberal Netroots Nations conference in Philadelphia. Jayapal was being asked to respond to a public spat between Pelosi and four newly elected progressive congresswomen nicknamed \u201cthe Squad\u201d: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. In an interview with New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd last Saturday, Pelosi made light of the Squad\u2019s influence. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d she said of the Squad. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d The four congresswomen were the only Democrats to vote against a House emergency border funding bill, which contained new conditions designed to ensure humane treatment of the asylum seekers surging across the border. The Squad thought that the conditions on how the money would be spent were insufficient and wanted to block additional funding for\u00a0Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00a0entirely. In the end, the GOP-controlled Senate passed a bipartisan border funding bill by a margin of 84 to 8\u00a0that contained far fewer humanitarian regulations aimed at improving conditions in the detention facilities holding the asylum seekers. When the bill came back to the House, moderate Democrats forced a vote on the Senate version without amending it to include the more-liberal House provisions, defying Pelosi\u2019s wishes and saddling her with a rare legislative loss. That Pelosi subsequently lashed out at the Squad for the first dissenting vote, rather than the centrists who foiled her plans when the Senate bill came back to the House, irked many progressive activists. It is also only the latest of many times when Pelosi has spoken dismissively about Ocasio-Cortez or her colleagues. In response, Ocasio-Cortez has gone so far as suggesting the four women are targets because they are not white. In an interview with The Washington Post, she criticized Pelosi for persistent \u201csingling out of newly elected women of color,\u201d which she called \u201coutright disrespectful.\u201d Jayapal, whose agenda largely depends on Pelosi\u2019s cooperation, couched her modest criticism of the remarks with a far lengthier defense of the governing philosophy she believes Pelosi intended to articulate. \u201cI believe that it all comes down to votes,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re on the outside or the inside, you\u2019ve got to be able to leverage the votes.\u201d Thus, according to Jayapal, Pelosi, an expert vote counter, was merely pointing out that because the Squad does not command the support of a larger bloc of votes, they lack the power to dictate House Democrats\u2019 agenda. \u201cI think what Pelosi was talking about is if you only have four votes in the House that you can\u2019t get what you want done,\u201d she said. Jayapal, who is an immigrant from India, added a subtle repudiation of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments questioning Pelosi\u2019s racial sensitivity. \u201cI don\u2019t typically find Pelosi to be someone who disrespects members,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt disrespected as a woman of color by Nancy Pelosi.\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) spoke alongside Jayapal on the panel at Netroots Nation, which was about how to enact ambitious progressive legislation. Jayapal arrived late from Washington because she had to vote on a defense spending bill, so initially Merkley had the panel to himself. He blamed House Democratic leaders for the passage of the unamended Senate bill, which he had voted against in the Senate. He argued that many Senate Democrats voted for the border security legislation on the assumption that House Democrats would pass their more ambitious version again and force the two legislative chambers into a conference committee that would produce a compromise. As a result of the House\u2019s failure to force the bills into a conference committee, Merkley said, \u201cWe lost all the leverage that the progressives like Rep. Jayapal had worked so hard to get. It just went down the tube.\u201d \u201cThe House has to carry its weight to restore the values of America,\u201d he added. \u201cIt failed on this occasion.\u201d When Jayapal arrived, she blamed Senate Democrats for passing the more conservative legislation by such a wide margin. That created a situation, she said, in which moderate House Democrats wondered why they could not just vote for such a consensus-driven bill. \u201cWe cannot have the Senate passing these big bipartisan votes because it affects what happens in the House,\u201d she said.",

      "content": " After Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) accused Amazon of paying its employees \u201cstarvation wages\u201d while its CEO Jeff Bezos enjoys the billionaire life, the tech giant pushed back, calling the congresswoman\u2019s remarks \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cjust wrong.\u201d Speaking with ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez suggested Amazon was not fairly compensating its employees while Bezos, who has a net worth of roughly $118 billion, continues to fatten his coffers. The freshman congresswoman clarified that she doesn\u2019t care if Bezos is a billionaire as long as Amazon pays its workers a \u201cliving wage\u201d and provides them with adequate benefits. But, she said, if Bezos\u2019 wealth is \u201cpredicated on paying people starvation wages and stripping them of the ability to access health care,\u201d then that\u2019s a major problem. Amazon hit back on Monday, saying in a tweet that it was \u201ca leader on pay at $15 min wage + full benefits from day one.\u201d Jay Carney, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of global corporate affairs, accused Ocasio-Cortez of \u201cmaking stuff up about Amazon.\u201d The company told CNN in a statement that the congresswoman\u2019s allegations were \u201cabsurd.\u201d But Ocasio-Cortez, a frequent critic of Amazon, had a rebuttal of her own. She took issue with the company\u2019s use of the term \u201cfrom day one,\u201d sharing a link on Twitter on Monday night to a Daily Beast story from September\u00a0about Amazon employees living \u201cpaycheck to paycheck\u201d and some relying on public assistance programs to make ends meet. \u201cIf a person is working 40h/week & is paid so little that they need gov help to make ends meet, it\u2019s not the person that\u2019s a weight on our system \u2015 it\u2019s the company,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. Amazon raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour last year after facing public pressure to do so.\u00a0The company said at the time that its public policy team would also begin lobbying for an increase in the federal minimum wage. \u201cWe listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,\u201d Bezos said in a statement of the wage increase. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.\u201d",

Democratic former New York state Assemblyman Dov Hikind and GOP congressional candidate Joseph Saladino (aka controversial YouTuber Joey Salads) on Tuesday announced separate lawsuits against Ocasio-Cortez, on the same day the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled that President Donald Trump cannot block critics from viewing his Twitter feed.

One problem, the congresswoman snapped back: \u201cThe last time you went on this trip it was reported that you also met [with] fringe Austrian neo-Nazi groups to talk shop.\u201d King reportedly\u00a0met with a group\u00a0founded by a former Nazi SS officer last year while visiting Europe on a trip paid for by From the Depths, the same group that has invited Ocasio-Cortez to tour Auschwitz. The Anti-Defamation League demanded afterward that GOP leadership condemn King and remove him from his chairmanship of the House Judiciary Committee. He was finally\u00a0stripped of his positions on the judiciary and the agriculture committees\u00a0earlier this year, after he asked during a New York Times interview what was offensive about white supremacy. Ocasio-Cortez added that she has \u201cabsolutely zero patience for completely certified, card-carrying and flag-waving racists. ... They can take their little tiki torches somewhere else.\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) also got caught in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s takedown. \u201cPerhaps you should come collect your colleague before more members of your caucus start saying the quiet parts loud,\u201d she wrote. King has not replied to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tweets. But several Twitter users joined the congresswoman in attacking him, and they supported her view that child detention sites are comparable to concentration camps. \u201cThese mattresses are perfectly comfortable.\u201d",

The freshman congresswoman from New York made her thoughts known in a very brief tweet on Friday. It\u2019s not exactly a surprise, especially after their harsh Twitter exchange last Sunday night. It started when Trump tweeted out a truncated quote from Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0that warned how Democrats could lose the 2020 election. Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cI think that we have a very real risk of losing the presidency to Donald Trump if we do not have a presidential candidate that is fighting for true transformational change in the lives of working people in the United States.\u201d Trump cut off the last part of her argument, tweeting: The New York Democrat fired back a few hours later and told the president that impeachment was a very real possibility. In April, Ocasio-Cortez said she\u2019d support a resolution introduced in March by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) that would look into whether the House should impeach the president. Currently, nearly 70 members of the House, overwhelmingly Democrats,\u00a0have called for an impeachment inquiry of Trump. This story has been updated to note that Ocasio-Cortez said she would support an impeachment resolution in April.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0(D-N.Y.) should be shot, mocking her as a \u201cvile idiot.\u201d On Thursday, Gretna officer Charlie Rispoli wrote that the congresswoman \u201cneeds a round, and I don\u2019t mean the kind she used to serve,\u201d according to NOLA.com, which first reported the remarks. The comment was written in response to a phony news article Rispoli shared that falsely accused Ocasio-Cortez of saying, \u201cWe pay soldiers too much.\u201d On Wednesday, fact-checking site Snopes.com debunked that story as a fake. Asked by NOLA.com for a reaction to Rispoli\u2019s now-deleted post, Chief Arthur Lawson called it \u201cdisturbing,\u201d but did not see it as a threat. \u201cI will tell you this: This will not go unchecked,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take this lightly and this will be dealt with on our end. It\u2019s not something we want someone that\u2019s affiliated with our department to make these types of statements.

In May, Ocasio-Cortez revealed in a Twitter thread that she has faced a \u201cflood of death threats,\u201d sometimes inspired by coverage on Fox News. \u201cI\u2018ve had mornings where I wake up & the 1st thing I do w/ my coffee is review photos of the men (it\u2019s always men) who want to kill me,\u201d she wrote, noting that she doesn\u2019t even see them all \u2015 only \u201cthe ones that have been flagged as particularly troubling.\u201d Last week, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.)\u00a0sent a letter to Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger, calling for the Capitol Police Board to \u201cre-examine\u201d its evaluation of security threats against Congress, citing Trump\u2019s remarks about Ocasio-Cortez and her colleagues as the reason for his concern. \u201cAs you are familiar, inflammatory remarks targeting individuals on social media and in public arena were a central feature of the presidential campaign and now, presidency of Donald J. Trump,\u201d Thompson wrote. \u201cThe President\u2019s rhetoric may insinuate more attacks on Members of Congress.\u201d At a House Administration Committee hearing on Tuesday,\u00a0Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said there were 4,894 cases of threats made against congressional lawmakers last year. \u201cSo far, for this year, we have 2,502 cases,\u201d he added. \u201cSo we\u2019re on par to probably break last year\u2019s record.\u201d",

      "content": " A writer whose great-great uncle served as director of a Japanese American concentration camp during World War II just wrote a column in support of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). While the freshman representative\u2019s description of the U.S. detention centers at the southern border as \u201cconcentration camps\u201d drew criticism from conservatives, Mary Catherine Ford, whose ancestor Clayton Triggs helped open the Manzanar War Relocation Center, said Ocasio-Cortez is \u201cright to call out what\u2019s happening in our southern border camps.\u201d \u201cI would know \u2014 because someone in my family opened the first Japanese American concentration camp in the United States,\u201d she wrote. In her piece, Ford brought up the Trump administration lawyer, Sarah Fabian, who made headlines last week for arguing in court that basic toiletries wouldn\u2019t fall under the law requiring \u201csafe and sanitary\u201d conditions for children in detention facilities. The writer noted that Fabian\u2019s argument draws a parallel to \u201ca speech my relative, Clayton Triggs, gave to Japanese Americans.\u201d \u201cHe promised them the camp would afford them a \u2018great latitude of freedom and self-governance,\u2019 as if his words could erase their incarceration behind barbed wire,\u201d she said. Ford further explained that Triggs had built the \u201cChildren\u2019s Village\u201d at Manzanar, the most closely guarded Japanese American incarceration camp. He had also requested permission to erect the concentration camp\u2019s barbed wire and eight guard towers \u201cfrom which soldiers would sit and point searchlights and live munitions down at these children.\u201d Upon hearing the news that the Trump administration planned to detain undocumented immigrant children apprehended at the border at Fort Sill, site of a former Japanese American concentration camp, Ford realized that \u201cthe past has returned.\u201d \u2033\u2018Safe and sanitary\u2019 and \u2018Children\u2019s Village,\u2019 \u2018summer camp\u2019 and \u2018freedom\u2019: then and now, the government uses language to hide and distort the truth,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLike a family that hides its shame, too many Americans accept the administration\u2019s distortions rather than face that truth.\u201d Ford wrote that the definition and function of concentration camps have remained consistent throughout history \u2015 they detain \u201ccivilians because of who they are, not what they have done.\u201d \u201cThis was true in 1942 when my family member opened the first concentration camp for Japanese Americans and it is true in 2019 as Trump continues his \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy of separating brown children from their loved ones and locking them in cages,\u201d she wrote. She concluded with a sentiment inspired by author Viet Thanh Nguyen, urging people to \u201cfight Trump\u2019s tale of an invasion, of \u2018animals\u2019 on our southern border by telling a more powerful story.\u201d Nina Wallace, a communications coordinator for Densho, an organization that works to preserve Japanese American history, previously told HuffPost that Manzanar was \u201cabsolutely\u201d a U.S. concentration camp. \u201cA concentration camp is a place where civilians are confined for military or political purposes based on their identity,\u201d she explained.\u00a0\u201cThese were compounds of barracks surrounded by barbed wire fences and patrolled by armed guards, which Japanese Americans could not leave without permission.\u201d Wallace told HuffPost that by failing to describe these detention facilities as concentration camps, the Trump administration is continuing to use euphemisms as a\u00a0\u201cdeliberate tool to obscure harsh realities and prevent us from recognizing historical patterns.\u201d Read Mary Catherine Ford\u2019s full article\u00a0here.",

      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) confronted the acting secretary of homeland security, Kevin McAleenan, on Thursday amid a report this month that DHS employees belonged to a secret Facebook group that shared violent, racist images among its members, including a photoshopped meme of the congresswomen being assaulted. McAleenan was grilled by the freshman lawmaker during a hearing before the House Oversight Committee about the Trump administration\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents. Ocasio-Cortez used her time to point to a July ProPublica report that uncovered the secret group, where around 9,500 members, some who belonged to Border Patrol, joked about migrant deaths and posted the violent memes. During her questioning, she asked if the acting secretary had seen photoshopped images of herself shared in the group, and asked if any members of Border Patrol affiliated with them were still responsible for working with migrant women and children. \u201cDid you see the images of officers circulating photoshopped images of my violent rape?\u201d the lawmaker asked. \u201cDo you think that the policy of child separation could have contributed to a dehumanizing culture within CBP that contributes and kind of spills over into other areas of conduct?\u201d McAleenan replied that he had, but demurred about any potential Border Patrol officers that had been reprimanded to for their involvement, saying simply that some had been placed on \u201cadministrative duties.\u201d An investigation by Customs and Border Patrol said this week it determined at least 62 current border agents were in the offensive group. \u201cWe do not have a dehumanizing culture at CBP. This is an agency that rescues 4,000 people a year. It\u2019s absolutely committed to the well-being of everyone that they interact with,\u201d McAleenan replied. He went on to note that the posts were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and said he had ordered an ongoing investigation \u201cwithin minutes\u201d of learning about the group. Ocasio-Cortez stood by her line of questioning on Twitter later that day, noting that in her estimation, Trump administration policies were \u201cgravely dehumanizing\u201d and had stripped \u201call involved of human decency.\u201d President Donald Trump and his immigration officials have faced a nonstop whirlwind of criticism over their hard-line border policies, including the short-lived but devastating \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that saw thousands of migrant children separated from their parents. Recently, border officials have been operating under the White House\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, which has seen thousands of asylum-seekers sent back across the southern border while they wait for their cases to be heard. Lawmakers also fired blistering criticism at McAleenan amid ongoing reports of filthy, overcrowded conditions at migrant detention centers along the southern border. \u201cWhat does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces? Can\u2019t take a shower?\u201d Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the oversight committee, said during the hearing. \u201cWhat\u2019s that about? None of us would have our children in that position. They are human beings.\u201d",

But Ocasio-Cortez said the real problem is white supremacy, and argued that it\u2019s an issue Republicans won\u2019t address because that would mean taking on part of their base: The suspected gunman in El Paso is a white man who reportedly shared a white supremacist manifesto online before the shooting. The hate-filled document attacked immigrants, claiming there is a \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d President Donald Trump has also called immigration an \u201cinvasion,\u201d including in his campaign ads on Facebook.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Social media accounts of some of the men identified by Twitter users were taken down \u2014 or shut down by Twitter for inappropriate postings \u2014 by Monday. But at least one Instagram account of a local Republican backer who also attended the picnic had it up late in the day. It was also later removed. Ocasio-Cortez slammed back at the Senate majority leader after seeing the post, asking if McConnell is \u201cpaying for young men to practice groping & choking members of Congress w/ your payroll, or is this just the standard culture of #TeamMitch?\u201d McConnell campaign spokesman Kevin Golden told HuffPost in an email that Team Mitch \u201cin no way condones any aggressive, suggestive, or demeaning act toward life-sized cardboard cutouts of any gender.\u201d He said the men are \u201cnot campaign staff; they\u2019re high schoolers, and it\u2019s incredible that the national media has sought to once again paint a target on their backs rather than report real, and significant news in our country.\u201d Some of the same men also appeared in a photo on the official \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d Instagram account for the Fancy Farm picnic, holding aloft cutout faces of Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. The photo was the second controversial image to come out of Team Mitch\u2019s participation at the Fancy Farm picnic. Another photo showed cardboard gravestones,\u00a0including one with the name of the Kentucky senator\u2019s Democratic challenger in 2020, Amy McGrath. The campaign tweeted the image under the headline: \u201cThe Grim Reaper of Socialism.\u201d McConnell\u2019s campaign manager, Kevin Golden, insisted the gravestones were a homage to a cartoon in the Louisville Courrier-Journal that featured gravestones, also including one of McGrath. Both images linking killing and death to political targets come at a particularly fraught time, after a weekend that saw two mass murders \u2014 including the apparently hate-fueled attack in El Paso, Texas, that has left 22 people dead. Critics are linking the violence to political leaders\u2019 hate speech and racist attacks. Ocasio-Cortez and three other freshman congresswomen of color \u2014 along with African American Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) \u2014 have been viciously attacked in recent weeks in public statements by President Donald Trump.",

Co-host Joy Behar, however, told the audience that the real \u201cenemy is the guy tweeting in his toilet\u201d \u2014 meaning President Donald Trump. Ocasio-Cortez called out Pelosi for her \u201coutright disrespectful\u201d attacks \u201csingling out newly elected women of color\u201d in a Washington Post interview published Wednesday. That followed Pelosi\u2019s slam in a New York Times interview Saturday that Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d of first-term Democratic congresswomen \u2015\u00a0Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) \u2014\u00a0that, although the women had their \u201cpublic whatever and Twitter world,\u201d they had little support in Congress.

You have to stop discounting that,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying to people,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this had to do with color. I think this is more, I don\u2019t know, B.S.\u201d She said later that if these women can\u2019t deliver a vote on a bill they back, \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to bitch about this.\u201d Co-host\u00a0Meghan McCain\u00a0also supported Pelosi\u2019s position in the feud, noting that the Democratic leader was the one who helped deliver the 2018 midterms for the party. But she also sniped that it was \u201cDemocrat-on-Democrat crime,\u201d adding that Republicans \u201csee the bigger picture\u201d and generally stay united. Though\u00a0Sunny Hostin was critical, she also emphasized that the younger women are energizing a disaffected segment of the Democrats, which shouldn\u2019t be discounted. \u201cI think you\u2019re seeing a generational clash ... it\u2019s unfortunate because I would hope that they could work together and that Pelosi would harness this sort of fervor that they have brought into the party,\u201d Hostin said. \u201cThere can be power if the two generations get together.\u201d The latest fissure erupted after Pelosi ended up ditching a House measure to instead\u00a0back the Senate version of a border security bill last month, even though it offered no guarantees for humanitarian aid for detained immigrant children. Goldberg indicated at the start of the segment that the four first-term congresswomen were the only Democrats to vote against the Senate version, but, in fact,\u00a095 Democrats in the House voted against it.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) should be shot \u2015 one of the officers wrote the menacing message and the other \u201cliked\u201d it. On Saturday, NOLA.com reported on the post that officer Charlie Rispoli wrote Thursday, calling the congresswoman a \u201cvile idiot\u201d who \u201cneeds a round, and I don\u2019t mean the kind she used to serve.\u201d According to NOLA,\u00a0officer Angelo Varisco then hit the \u201clike\u201d button. In a Monday press conference, Gretna Police Chief Arthur Lawson announced that both had lost their jobs that day for violating the department\u2019s social media policy. \u201cThis incident we feel has been an embarrassment to our department that these officers have certainly acted in a manner which was unprofessional, alluding to a violent act to be conducted against a sitting U.S. congress[woman], a member of our government,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tolerate that.\u201d Though it is a felony crime to threaten a sitting member of Congress, Lawson told NOLA he did not feel the Facebook post represented a legitimate threat. The Gretna Police Department did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. Rispoli wrote the comment while sharing a fake news article that falsely claimed Ocasio-Cortez said,\u00a0\u201cWe pay soldiers too much.\u201d Fact-checking site Snopes.com debunked that story on Wednesday. On Monday afternoon, the congresswoman responded to news of the threatening remark on Twitter, blaming President Donald Trump for \u201csowing violence\u201d and \u201ccreating an environment where people can get hurt & he claims plausible deniability.\u201d \u201cThis is Trump\u2019s goal when he uses targeted language & threatens elected officials who don\u2019t agree w/ his political agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s authoritarian behavior.\u201d Last week, the president began attacking Ocasio-Cortez along with three other lawmakers of color \u2015 Reps.\u00a0Ilhan Omar\u00a0(D-Minn.),\u00a0Ayanna Pressley\u00a0(D-Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). The president wrote a series of tweets in which he urged \u201d\u2018Progressive\u2019 Democratic Congresswomen\u201d to \u201cgo back\u201d to \u201cthe totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d All were born in the U.S. with the exception of Omar who emigrated from Somalia as a child. Trump\u2019s remarks have since drawn widespread condemnations for their blatant racism, though he has repeatedly doubled down on the comments. And he is now targeting the women by name,\u00a0including in tweets and in statements made at his Wednesday North Carolina rally,\u00a0as well as in media interviews. In May, Ocasio-Cortez opened up on Twitter about the security risks of her job, stating that she has received a \u201cflood of death threats.\u201d \u201cI\u2018ve had mornings where I wake up & the 1st thing I do w/ my coffee is review photos of the men (it\u2019s always men) who want to kill me,\u201d she wrote. During a\u00a0House Administration Committee hearing on Tuesday,\u00a0Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund confirmed that lawmakers will likely be at higher risk this fiscal year compared to the last. So far, this year 2,502 cases of threats have been seen, Sund said, noting that \u201cwe\u2019re on par to probably break\u201d last year\u2019s record total of 4,894 cases.",

      "author": "Ariel Edwards-Levy",
      "content": " The 2020 general election is still more than a year away, but it\u2019s never too early for some truly unhelpful polling coverage. As part of the latest salvo of Democratic infighting, Axios published Sunday what they called an \u201cexclusive poll\u201d from May of white likely voters without college degrees. The results, Axios\u2019 Mike Allen wrote, have been circulated by top Democrats to show\u00a0\u201cthat one of the House\u2019s most progressive members \u2014 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 has become a definitional face for the party with a crucial group of swing voters.\u201d Just don\u2019t ask where it came from. \u201cThe group that took the poll shared the results with Axios on the condition that it not be named because the group has to work with all parts of the party,\u201d Allen wrote. Why it matters: With public trust in polling frayed, and pollsters adopting an increasingly diverse array of methods to keep up with the times, transparency has become more crucial than ever both for the firms conducting surveys and the outlets reporting on them \u2015 making the idea of reporting on an \u201canonymous poll\u201d an unfortunate outlier. Here are some of the Associated Press\u2019s guidance for survey reporting: \u201cReputable poll sponsors and public opinion researchers will disclose the methodology used to conduct the survey, including the questions asked and the results to each, so that their survey may be subject to independent examination and analysis by others\u2026. Polls paid for by candidates or interest groups may be designed to produce results that are beneficial to that candidate or group, and they may be released selectively as a campaign tactic or publicity ploy.\u201d Here\u2019s an excerpt from CNN\u2019s new standards for writing about polls: \u201cEvaluating the validity of a poll is only possible if pollsters are transparent about what they are doing. Transparency has become a critical part of how those in the survey research world assess the validity of other research ... A poll\u2019s existence alone does not make it news, and journalists shouldn\u2019t be any more credulous about numbers than they are about words.\u201d In this case, readers have no way of knowing who commissioned the poll, who conducted it, how they identified the voters they surveyed, what methodology they used to interview them or what exactly respondents were asked. That makes it basically impossible to evaluate the survey in any meaningful way. Go deeper: Beyond the questionable sourcing, the polling data provided doesn\u2019t make a clear case that white voters who aren\u2019t college graduates see Ocasio-Cortez as the face of the party. The numbers included \u2015 name recognition and favorability for Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), as well as opinions on capitalism and socialism \u2015 suggest that both congresswomen have unusually high national profiles for freshman representatives and that neither is popular among the subgroup surveyed. But those numbers don\u2019t establish whether they\u2019re seen as defining all Democrats. That\u2019s an eminently pollable question: A 2017 CNN survey, for instance, asked, \u201cThinking about Democratic leaders today\u2015which one person best reflects the core values of the Democratic Party?\u201d It also doesn\u2019t establish whether they\u2019re actually less popular than Democrats in general. The bloc polled \u2015 white voters who aren\u2019t college graduates\u2015 is Republican-leaning in general. And in one publicly available poll,\u00a0a February Economist/YouGov survey, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s net favorability rating (that is, the share who rated her favorably minus the share who rated her unfavorably) among white voters without degrees was roughly in line with ratings for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and for Democrats as a whole. That\u2019s obviously one datapoint, and a dated one at that. But it suggests that these voters tend to be consistent either in liking the Democratic Party and its politicians or in disliking them. There are a few additional hazy details in the Axios story. The headline implies that its findings reflect \u201cswing states,\u201d but the article doesn\u2019t make it clear whether the poll was conducted nationally or only in battleground states. And although the article provides exact percentages on how few of the voters polled viewed Ocasio-Cortez and Omar favorably, it doesn\u2019t include numbers on how many viewed them outright unfavorably, rather than having no opinion. The bottom line: Basing a story on unsourced, thinly contextualized polling data isn\u2019t savvy; it\u2019s deeply credulous.",

According to a statement from Ocasio-Cortez, Chakrabarti will join climate change-focused nonprofit New Consensus to help further develop the Green New Deal, an ambitious economic and environmental initiative promoted by Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive Democrats. \u201cI am extraordinarily grateful for his service to advance a bold agenda and improve the lives of the people in NY-14,\u201d the congresswoman said. \u201cFrom his co-founding of Justice Democrats to his work on the campaign and in the official office, Saikat\u2019s goal has always been to do whatever he can to help the larger progressive movement, and I look forward to continuing working with him to do just that.\u201d Trent will return to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign where he will direct communications for her 2020 reelection bid. \u201cWith the Ocasio2020 campaign beginning to ramp up, I\u2019ve asked Corbin to transition to the campaign full-time and he has agreed to do so,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to growing the movement with him in Queens and the Bronx and across the country.\u201d Chakrabarti, an alum of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-Vt.) 2016 presidential campaign, co-founded Justice Democrats in 2017, a progressive political group that jump-started Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s congressional run, leading to the defeat of incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley (D), who hadn\u2019t faced a primary challenger since 2004. In June, Chakrabarti appeared to inflame existing tensions between Ocasio-Cortez and moderate Democrats, writing in a now-deleted tweet that the New Democrats and the Blue Dog Caucus should instead be called the \u201cNew Southern Democrats,\u201d a reference to pro-segregationists. \u201cThey certainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did the 40s,\u201d he wrote. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who had feuded publicly with Ocasio-Cortez in the past over her progressive views, spoke out, calling the tweet \u201coffensive,\u201d according to Politico. In July, Pelosi privately warned her colleagues to stop airing their political grievances on Twitter, telling them to come to her instead, NBC News reported. Shortly after Pelosi delivered the word of caution, the House Democrats\u2019 Twitter account took aim at Chakrabarti online for a critique of Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), who\u00a0voted to pass\u00a0an emergency federal appropriations bill for humanitarian aid and security at the southern border, such as President Donald Trump\u2019s wall. Frustrated by Davids\u2019 decision, which the bills\u2019 opponents said gave into Trump\u2019s demands,\u00a0Chakrabarti said she was one of a horde of\u00a0Democrats voting \u201cas a block to criminalize immigrants.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe Sharice is a racist person, but her votes are showing her to enable a racist system,\u201d he clarified. In response, the\u00a0House Democratic Caucus account tweeted back,\u00a0\u201ckeep her name out of your mouth.\u201d According to The Intercept, which first reported the news, Chakrabarti\u2019s last day was Friday.",

      "content": " The worst thing about touring immigrant detention facilities at the border was seeing cruelty occur under the American flags hung everywhere, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said Friday while testifying on family separations and the treatment of migrants. \u201cChildren are being separated from their families in front of an American flag,\u201d the congresswoman told the House Oversight Committee as she fought back tears. \u201cWe cannot allow for this.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, a fierce critic of the Trump administration, was among four Democratic members of Congress to testify before fellow lawmakers about what they saw during visits to the border. They described seeing migrants covered in filth from an inability to shower or change, with canker sores from unhealthy food, and only thin blankets for sleeping on concrete. They called on Congress to act as migrants report overcrowded facilities and little access to care or medication. The Trump administration has blamed the number of undocumented immigrants arriving at the border \u2015 which dipped last month but hit record numbers earlier this year \u2015 on loose immigration laws, demanding more funding, a border wall and legal changes to restrict access to asylum. But the Democrats argued the administration has exacerbated the crisis through its policies, including the family separations it carried out last year. Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), who represents a district on the border with Mexico, also testified at the hearing. \u201cThis is not a matter of resources, but a matter of will,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have the power to change this. Do we have the will?\u201d She called her city, El Paso, \u201ca modern day Ellis Island.\u201d Volunteers there have helped migrants for years. Over the last year, they have ramped up efforts to feed, shelter and care for the thousands of migrant families released weekly by the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cMy community, with a fraction of the resources available to the federal government, has responded more strategically, thoughtfully and compassionately than the federal government has,\u201d Escobar said. During testimony from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), she displayed a drawing by a detained child showing people being held in a cell and asked the audience not to look away. Wiping away tears, Tlaib went on to tell the stories of the people she met at various border facilities, including one about a pregnant woman who has since been released. She also noted that 100 Border Patrol agents died by suicide from 2007 to 2018. Family separations were hard on agents as well as migrants, she said. \u201cThe dehumanization is not only with those families, but it\u2019s also with the agents that we\u2019ve told to do this to these families,\u201d Tlaib said. Describing the Trump administration\u2019s current strategy as cruel and intentional, she said it\u2019s \u201cdead set on sending a hate-filled message, that those seeking refuge are not welcome in America. In our America.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said 100 Border Patrol agents had died by suicide between 2017 and 2018. The time period was 2007 to 2018.",

      "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Sunday sided with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and her fellow progressive freshman congresswomen amid an ongoing spat over tactics and policy with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Asked during an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d whether Pelosi was being too tough on the freshman New York congresswoman, Sanders said, \u201cI think a little bit.\u201d The intraparty fight spilled into the open when, in an interview with The New York Times, Pelosi dismissed the power of Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow progressive freshmen in the House: Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.). The four lawmakers had opposed a House funding bill aiming to address the migrant crisis at the border because it didn\u2019t provide sufficient restrictions on how the Trump administration could spend the money. They also vocally protested when the House later passed a weaker Senate version with even fewer restrictions after moderates in the lower chamber signaled their support for the bill. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. But they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got,\u201d Pelosi said when asked about the freshman congresswomen, who have a large following online. Ocasio-Cortez responded by calling Pelosi\u2019s \u201csingling out\u201d of Democratic women of color \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d The spat continued late Friday night, after the official Twitter account for House Democrats \u2015 managed by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), a member of party leadership \u2014 fired off a critical tweet about Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff. House Democrats were reportedly incensed when the aide,\u00a0Saikat Chakrabarti, compared current moderate Democrats to the Southern Democrats who enabled segregationist policies in the 1940s. During his interview on Sunday, Sanders,\u00a0who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, seemed to echo concerns about Pelosi singling out the four women. \u201cYou cannot ignore the young people of this country who are passionate about economic and racial and social and environmental justice. You gotta bring them in, not alienate them,\u201d he said. The discord among Democrats may end up being short-lived. President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0racist tweet Sunday morning telling the four Democratic congresswomen to \u201cgo back\u201d to their native countries \u2014 when all are U.S. citizens, and only one was born abroad \u2014 will likely only unify the House Democratic Caucus.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " QUEENS, N.Y. \u2015 Less than a week after President Donald Trump told her to \u201cgo back\u201d to her country, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) returned to her home \u2014 New York City. She held a town hall in Corona, Queens \u2014 her first since the end of June. The topic of the forum, held in the auditorium of a public school, was immigration \u2015 the same issue that had landed her in the crosshairs of both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Trump. But facing hundreds of her diverse and adoring constituents, some of whom held homemade signs welcoming her, the freshman congresswoman defended her progressive vision of immigration reform against attacks from both Republicans and her fellow Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019re here. They sent me back to Queens \u2015 and I\u2019m happy to be here,\u201d she began with a chuckle, drawing sustained applause and shouts of \u201cwelcome home\u201d from the crowd. Ocasio-Cortez trained her fire first on Trump, arguing that his remarks revealed his racist character. \u201cAll you need to do is hear what the president did this week to know that this is not about immigration at all. Because once you start telling American citizens to quote \u2018go back to their countries,\u2019 this tells you that this president\u2019s policies are not about immigration, it\u2019s about ethnicity and race,\u201d she said. \u201cHis biggest mistake was that he said the quiet part loud.\u201d But without naming names, the New York congresswoman also acknowledged that she has been taking flak for her positions from fellow Democrats. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it real with you all, even within our party it\u2019s a difficult issue. ... One of the reasons I get in trouble is because I talk about immigration too much. It\u2019s because I try to protect our community quote-unquote too much. It\u2019s because I say that there are some things that should not be up to politics and putting kids in cages is one of them,\u201d she said, prompting loud applause. Ocasio-Cortez called for the creation of a commission \u2014 modeled after the storied commission that analyzed the causes of the Sept. 11 attacks \u2014 to look into the causes and impact of the Trump administration\u2019s policy of separating immigrant children from their parents. \u201cThat kind of study is what\u2019s going to be required in order to reunify as many children with their parents as possible,\u201d she said. In her remarks, Ocasio-Cortez also proposed a similar commission to study the damage and aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. In a subsequent tweet, she added an appeal for a panel to study reparations for the descendants of slaves. Rarely, if ever, has Ocasio-Cortez felt more pressure from her party leadership than in the past few weeks. At the end of June, Ocasio-Cortez and the three Democratic colleagues \u2015 Reps. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.) \u2015 who are together known as \u201cthe Squad,\u201d were the only House Democrats to vote against a border funding bill backed by Speaker Pelosi and House leadership that sought to provide greater resources for federal authorities to deal with a surge of asylum-seekers at the Southern border. The congresswomen cast their votes as a matter of conscience, arguing that there were inadequate humanitarian strings attached to the new money and that border funding should be conditional on an end to practices like the detention of children. The bill passed easily, despite their opposition. The Republican Senate passed a border funding bill with none of the conditions the House approved. But rather than pass their bill again in the House and force a conference committee to draw up a compromise between the two chambers, moderate Democrats in the House led a revolt against Pelosi that forced the passage of the unamended Senate bill. Rather than publicly chide the moderates, Pelosi targeted the Squad, telling a New York Times columnist on July 6, \u201cThese people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. But they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d A war of words ensued between members of the Squad, who felt unfairly singled out, and Democratic leadership and its staffers, who are wary of the progressive primary challenges that propelled Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley to power. The tiff came to a head on July 12 when the House Democratic Caucus\u2019 official Twitter account insulted Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff and Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff retweeted it. Ocasio-Cortez defended her vote against the original House vote again on Saturday, even as she avoided reviving the now-dormant feud with Pelosi and her allies. She argued that it lacked the key humanitarian provisions, like the addition of doctors to facilities run by the Customs and Border Protection agency. \u201cI got heat from my own party for ... making that point,\u201d she said of the vote. \u201cBut if we really want to pass a humanitarian bill, then let\u2019s pass a humanitarian bill. If it\u2019s not a humanitarian bill, don\u2019t call it a humanitarian bill.\u201d The event, which was translated into Spanish, Mandarin, Bangla, Tibetan, Nepali and American Sign Language in real time, felt like a window into an alternative progressive universe where the heavily populated, diverse and more liberal communities in coastal cities actually drove the policy agenda on Capitol Hill. Ocasio-Cortez even indulged the audience with her vision of a proactive immigration policy that does not merely react to Trump, but tears down barriers that preceded him. She called for making immigration enforcement a civil, rather than a criminal, matter once again. Her appeal echoes the message of former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, the only Latino presidential candidate, who has made turning unauthorized border crossing into a civil, rather than criminal, offense a cornerstone of his campaign. \u201cEspecially when it comes to immigration ... it feels like we\u2019re always coming from a defensive place. We\u2019re just trying to protect what we have,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to talk about the world that we want and are fighting for.\u201d Thanks to the existence of the Senate, partisan gerrymandering in the House and exaggerated fears of a mythical conservative swing voter, Democratic leaders in Congress are often cautious to the point of inaction. They are constantly seeking a balance between policies that curb Trump\u2019s worst excesses and more milquetoast maneuvers designed not to turn off the moderate voters they believe they need to win elections. It\u2019s a reality Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged, noting that her Democratic colleagues shot down an amendment to the defense budget she proposed that would have banned U.S. troops at the Southern border. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) told HuffPost on Wednesday that the committee did not issue any recommendation to members on whether to vote for the amendment because of the objections of more moderate Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee. Even if Democrats have unified control of the federal government, Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that immigration policy is going to change. Because if we elect a party that thinks creating a humane border is going to lose them the election, they\u2019re not going to create that humane border.\u201d \u201cA lot of the work we need to do is cultural, because we need to make immigration policy a commonsense, non-radical thing,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez added. Perhaps in an attempt to move that cultural needle, Ocasio-Cortez did not repeat her characterization of the border detention centers as \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d She also sought to give historical context to another town hall speaker\u2019s call to dismantle the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, noting that its creation in 2003 combined many federal agencies with different functions that could easily be spun off once more. \u201cReorganizing and getting rid of DHS is not as radical as George Bush\u2019s implementation and creation of DHS,\u201d she said. Whether Ocasio-Cortez will succeed in building more support for her policy agenda inside Congress with such arguments remains to be seen. But she has a powerful campaign war chest at her disposal and \u2015 as the ecstatic throngs of supporters who came to see her on a steamy Saturday attest \u2015 she enjoys a grassroots following that is likely unparalleled in the House. To the extent that her supporters were aware of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s feud with Pelosi, they appeared to side with their congresswoman. \u201cPelosi needs to go. Her day has come and gone,\u201d said Rhoda Dunn, a real estate broker from Jackson Heights who brought a homemade \u201cWelcome Home AOC\u201d sign. Some of those in attendance were not even from the district, but had instead come from other parts of New York City to see the rockstar congresswoman in person. One such Ocasio-Cortez fan, Michael Howard, traveled from Far Rockaway, a neighborhood in southeast Queens represented by Rep. Gregory Meeks. Meeks succeeded Joe Crowley, whom Ocasio-Cortez ousted in June 2018, as chairman of the Queens County Democratic Party, and is a political adversary of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s in borough politics. \u201cHer and these three other congresswomen who are trying to save this country more than anyone else in Washington, D.C. \u2015 they\u2019re like the Ninja Turtles,\u201d Howard said, referencing a popular culture franchise. \u201cAnd Bernie Sanders is Splinter,\u201d he added referencing the ninja turtles\u2019 fictional teacher.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted on Thursday. To respond, she attached a NowThis video of her with Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) shouting, \u201cExperience doesn\u2019t pay the bills!\u201d The video was filmed for Pay Our Interns, a nonprofit group that advocates for more paid internships in the government, for-profit and nonprofit sectors. In September, Congress approved a spending package for the 2019 fiscal year that set aside about $14 million\u00a0to pay congressional interns, the first time that the Hill allocated funds for paid internships. The House received about $8.8 million to distribute across lawmakers\u2019 offices, and the Senate got $5 million. The appropriations bill added an average of $20,000 for each House member and $50,000 for each senator to pay interns. Last month, Pay Our Interns released the results\u00a0of its House internship audit and found that only 9% of congressional offices advertise paid internships, while 61% advertise that they don\u2019t offer paid internships. \u201cMany believe our work on Capitol Hill is done because Congress appropriated the funds, but these numbers prove that our work is only beginning,\u201d Pay Our Interns co-founder Guillermo Creamer said in a June 25 statement. \u201cIt is astonishing to see that so many offices have decided not to use any of the $20,000 allocated for intern pay. What is even more alarming is the percentage of offices that provide no information about intern salaries whatsoever.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez has pointedly advocated for a living wage for congressional interns. She said in December that all interns in her office would be paid $15 an hour with benefits, and announced in February that she would pay her staff no less than $52,000 a year. The amount, first reported by Roll Call, was almost unheard of for many congressional staff members in their 20s who work long hours with little to no pay.",

      "content": " Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez doesn\u2019t think former Vice President Joe Biden is the right fit for the Democratic nomination for president. In an interview with Vogue,\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said she was wary about making an endorsement prior to the Democratic primary debates this week. But she did add Biden wasn\u2019t the \u201cpragmatic choice,\u201d especially given his recent comments fondly recalling his work with segregationists. \u201cI think that he\u2019s not a pragmatic choice,\u201d she said. She told Vogue: \u201cThat\u2019s my frustration with politics today, that they\u2019re willing to give up every single person in America just for that dude in a diner. . .Just so that you can get this very specific slice of Trump voters? If you pick the perfect candidate like Joe Biden to win that guy in the diner, the cost will make you lose because you will depress turnout as well. And that\u2019s exactly what happened to 2016. We picked the logically fitting candidate, but that candidate did not inspire the turnout that we needed.\u201d Even without his controversial comments, Biden has been steadily slipping in the polls since he announced his presidential bid, though he still holds a lead over a sea of other Democratic candidates.\u00a0Sens.\u00a0Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) remain his strongest competitors leading into the primary debates. The favor of Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, appears to have some political weight to it. Her pick for a progressive district attorney in Queens, New York, Tiffany Caban, declared victory in her contested race on Tuesday night, though officials say the race remains too close to call.

      "author": "Kimberley Richards",
      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) defended her decision to block certain Twitter users after the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University urged her not to block people based on their \u201cviewpoints.\u201d The progressive lawmaker argued on Twitter on Thursday that among her some 5.2 million followers on the social media platform, she has fewer than 20 users blocked due to reported harassment. She added that none of the blocked users are her constituents. \u201cHarassment is not a viewpoint,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote. \u201cSome accounts, like the Daily Caller, posted fake nude photos of me & abused my comments to spread it. No one is entitled to abuse.\u201d In January, the Caller, a right-wing news site, published an explicit photo of a woman who was not Ocasio-Cortez, along with\u00a0a misleading headline that did not clearly state it was not the lawmaker in the photo. The publication later said it regretted the headline and changed it. The Knight First Amendment Institute, which works to defend freedom of speech in the digital age, issued a letter to Ocasio-Cortez in hopes of \u201cdissuading\u201d her from blocking Twitter users due to their \u201cviews.\u201d The institute argued that Ocasio-Cortez uses her personal account as \u201can extension\u201d of her formal office. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In July, New York state Assemblyman Dov Hikind (D) and GOP congressional candidate Joseph Saladino (a controversial YouTuber known as Joey Salads), filed separate lawsuits against Ocasio-Cortez, claiming the representative had blocked them on Twitter. Hikind\u2019s lawsuit cited a July ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, in a legal challenge by the institute, which found that the First Amendment forbids President Donald Trump from blocking his critics from viewing his Twitter account.\u00a0The decision upheld a May 2018 ruling. \u201cThe First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise-open online dialog because they expressed views with which the official disagrees,\u201d Circuit Judge Barrington Parker wrote\u00a0in the July ruling. Ocasio-Cortez, who represents New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District, addressed the institute\u2019s letter in another tweet from her personal account on Thursday. \u201cPeople are free to speak whatever classist, racist, false, misogynistic, bigoted comments they\u2019d like,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey do not have the right to force others to endure their harassment and abuse.\u201d The Knight First Amendment Institute acknowledged in its letter that Ocasio-Cortez \u201cmay wish to block users for reasons that are both reasonable and constitutionally legitimate \u2015 for example, because their speech is threatening.\u201d The institute also noted the persistent threats and abuse that women of color often face on social media, and wrote that those attacks \u201ccan deter speech and political participation that are crucial to our democracy.\u201d \u201cWe would welcome the chance to work with you to develop a social media policy that both complies with the First Amendment and helps you address threats, abuse, and harassment,\u201d the institute\u2019s letter read. CORRECTION: A prior version of this article stated that the Knight First Amendment Institute represented Hikind and Saladino in their July lawsuits. It did not.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Storming past questions about his health, Bernie Sanders vowed that he\u2019s \u201cmore ready than ever\u201d to fight for a political revolution \u2014 with a little help from new friends \u2014 at a rally Saturday that drew thousands to a New York City park. The rally offered a pointed reminder to skeptics in both political parties that the 78-year-old democratic socialist is still very much a force in the 2020 presidential race. Sanders opened his remarks by apologizing that he secured a permit for only 20,000 people. His campaign, he said, was forced to close the gates on many more people who were trying to enter the Queens park just across the river from Manhattan. \u201cTo put it bluntly, I am back,\u201d Sanders declared, sparking chants of, \u201cBernie is back\u201d from the massive crowd. \u201cI am happy to report to you that I am more than ready \u2014 more ready than ever \u2014 to carry on with you on the epic struggle that we face today,\u201d he added. \u201cI am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States.\u201d The event marked Sanders\u2019 formal return to the campaign trail less than three weeks after he suffered a heart attack that threatened both his life and political future. Even before that, he was in danger of falling out of the top-tier in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Polls suggest he\u2019s lagging behind liberal rival Elizabeth Warren and establishment favorite Joe Biden. But the fiery Brooklyn native, backed by a slate of new endorsements and two new stents in an artery connected to his heart, appeared to be expanding his coalition on Saturday. A security company hired by the campaign reported a crowd estimate of 25,000. Among those speaking, filmmaker and activist Michael Moore told the cheering crowd that he was endorsing Sanders, shortly before Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., praised the Vermont senator on stage. \u201cBernie Sanders fought for me,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said as she introduced Sanders. She heaped praise on the Vermont senator but did not explicitly say that she was endorsing him. The Sanders campaign announced earlier in the week that she had. Before the rally, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said endorsements this past week from Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., in particular were proof that the Sanders campaign is growing. He predicted that they would especially help Sanders strengthen his support among young, minority voters. \u201cThose are two people who I think have immense power to mobilize young people, and I promise you you\u2019ll be seeing them in Iowa, but not only in Iowa, but around the country, trying to get people engaged around the issues,\u201d Shakir said. For now, at least, Sanders can use the help. While he insists he\u2019s ready to move forward, he\u2019s doing so cautiously. Saturday\u2019s rally was his only scheduled appearance before he returns to Iowa late in the coming week. The week after, he\u2019ll join Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for a tour of her congressional district. Tlaib hasn\u2019t announced whether she\u2019ll endorse Sanders, but she is part of the same small \u201csquad\u201d of minority women on Capitol Hill who gave been a target of President Donald Trump. Despite the aggressive rhetoric from Sanders himself, senior adviser Jeff Weaver said Sanders would ease himself back onto the campaign trail. But by December, he predicted, Sanders health scare will be forgotten. Almost all the speakers during Saturday\u2019s event, which spanned several hours on a sunny, crisp fall afternoon, played down the health concerns. \u201cThe only heart attack we should be talking about is the one Wall Street is going to have when Bernie Sanders is president,\u201d said Moore, the filmmaker. Nina Turner, one of Sanders\u2019 national co-chairs, said it \u201cboggles my mind\u201d that Sanders\u2019 critics have embraced \u201cageism.\u201d \u201cLife happens to us all,\u201d she said. \u201cMemo to the haters: hashtag Bernie Is Back,\u201d she added. \u201cWe never went anywhere, we just pushed pause for a minute.\u201d",
