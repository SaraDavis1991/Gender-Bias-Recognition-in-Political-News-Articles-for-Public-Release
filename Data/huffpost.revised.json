      "content": " The Trump administration escalated its political war with California on Monday, threatening to withhold federal funding for the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highways unless officials dealt with what they referred to as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cworst air quality in the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Andrew Wheeler, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a letter to California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Air Resources Board this week that the state had failed to address a backlog of air pollution control plans mandated by federal law. Unless the state takes action on about 130 plans, Wheeler said the EPA would begin a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisapproval process\u00e2\u0080\u009d that could impact billions in funding for its highways. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince the 1970s, California has failed to carry out its most basic tasks under the Clean Air Act,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wheeler wrote in a letter dated Sept. 24, which was first reported by The Sacramento Bee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCalifornia has the worst air quality in the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wheeler requested a response from state officials by Oct. 10. The Bee notes that California was projected to receive around $19 billion in funding from the Federal Highway Administration from 2016 to 2020. The White House has locked horns with California over environmental issues for months. Last week, the Trump administration said it would revoke California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal authority to set its own auto emissions standards, part of its effort to roll back strict emissions standards set by the Obama administration as a key part of its effort to tackle climate change. California sued the Trump administration shortly after the move was announced, joining nearly two dozen other states. The Trump administration has also been wielding the power of the EPA in recent months as a means to hit back at the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to set its own pollution and climate change standards, even as the White House has rolled back or eliminated dozens of environmental regulations. Last week, Trump said he planned to order the EPA to tell San Francisco it was in \u00e2\u0080\u009ctotal violation\u00e2\u0080\u009d of federal regulations, citing used syringes and other pollution he said was linked to the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homeless populations. Officials in the city fired back, saying there was no evidence to back up the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claims. The New York Times reported early Tuesday that Trump has been angered by California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to circumvent his administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rollbacks of environmental rules. The outlet said that in response, the White House has focused on efforts to punish the state. Wheeler wrote in his letter this week that the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backlog of air pollution control plans had impacted up to 34 million Californians and that the agency was only moving to address decades of lapses in environmental monitoring. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur foremost concern must be ensuring clean air for all Americans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is our goal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": " Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said allowing Congress to see a whistleblower complaint that allegedly calls into question President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky would set a \u00e2\u0080\u009cterrible precedent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Democrats and some legal experts say granting Congress access to the complaint is required by law. Mnuchin, during an appearance on CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cState of the Union\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sunday, defended Trump against reports that he repeatedly pressured Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The House Intelligence Committee has opened an investigation into the complaint, including whether Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine as part of his efforts to get Zelensky to investigate Biden, a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community, deemed the complaint credible and of \u00e2\u0080\u009curgent concern,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote in a letter earlier this month to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, whom Trump appointed last month, reportedly said he does not believe the complaint meets the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009curgent concern\u00e2\u0080\u009d and has refused to hand it over to Congress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a whistleblower who wants to bring this information \u00e2\u0080\u0095 his whistleblower complaint \u00e2\u0080\u0095 to Congress, and the White House is preventing that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jake Tapper told Mnuchin on Sunday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there really is nothing there, why shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the White House just let Congress ... look at this whistleblower complaint?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mnuchin responded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that would be a terrible precedent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cConversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if every time someone for political reasons raised a question and all of a sudden those conversations were disclosed publicly \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and when you disclose them to Congress, lots of times they leak into the press \u00e2\u0080\u0095 then why would world leaders want to have conversations together?\u00e2\u0080\u009d There is no evidence to suggest the U.S intelligence official, who has not been publicly identified, filed the complaint due to political motivations. .@jaketapper presses Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call to Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president and reports about their discussions about investigating Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think things are being implied that just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist\u00e2\u0080\u009d #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/oni7mESXqt Biden has called on Trump to release a transcript of his phone call with Zelensky. Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing, told reporters Sunday that his conversation with the Ukrainian president was \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect\u00e2\u0080\u009d but he would consider releasing a transcript of the call. Whether Congress has the legal authority to see the complaint after Maguire refused to hand it over has been the subject of debate among some intelligence officials and legal experts. Though there are laws in place to protect whistleblowers who come forward, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unprecedented for the top national intelligence official to stop Congress from viewing a whistleblower complaint that the inspector general deems of \u00e2\u0080\u009curgent concern,\u00e2\u0080\u009d reported The Washington Post. Maguire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal team argues that the complaint did not meet the legal standard of \u00e2\u0080\u009curgent concern\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he is therefore not required to submit it to Congress. Atkinson disagrees and has said he worries Maguire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions will deter future whistleblowers from coming forward. Democrats say the allegations against Trump, if true, amount to a U.S. president seeking assistance from a foreign government to help his reelection campaign. Though some Republicans, including Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.), have said such a scenario would be highly inappropriate, other members of the GOP have defended Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it the position of the administration that it is acceptable for politicians to pressure foreign leaders to look into and investigate their political rivals?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tapper asked Mnuchin on Sunday. Mnuchin said he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t on the call in question but said he has \u00e2\u0080\u009cno reason to believe\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump pressured Zelensky. But Tapper continued to press Mnuchin, asking him whether he would have found it \u00e2\u0080\u009cinappropriate\u00e2\u0080\u009d if former President Barack Obama pressured a foreign leader to investigate Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eldest sons, Don Jr. and Eric, and their international business dealings. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to speculate on that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mnuchin said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I do find inappropriate is the fact that Vice President Biden at the time\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son [sic] did very significant business deals in Ukraine. I for one find that to be concerning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump has claimed Biden called on a notoriously corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine to be removed from office to impede an investigation into a Ukrainian gas company, of which Hunter had been a member of the board.\u00c2\u00a0Ukrainian authorities have said they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t found any wrongdoing by Biden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tapper continued to grill Mnuchin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OK for Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump to do business all over the world, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OK for Ivanka Trump to have copyrights approved all over the world while President Trump is president, but while Vice President Biden was vice president, his son shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been able to do business dealings?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgain, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really want to go into more of these details,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mnuchin responded, before Tapper interrupted him, stating that his comments were \u00e2\u0080\u009csetting a precedent that the president is violating.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Trump Organization, headed by the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eldest sons, has come under fire over its deals with foreign investors, which some government watchdog groups say violate the emoluments clause, a section of the Constitution that prohibits gifts to government officials.",

      "content": " Strapped American farmers were reeling after President Donald Trump announced Friday he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need a trade agreement with China until after the 2020 election. Chinese negotiators in Washington then abruptly canceled planned visits to farms in Nebraska and Montana to head back to China early. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFarmers are in serious, serious financial straits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, told HuffPost Saturday. He said he fears Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes not have the skill set or the experience to fix things\u00e2\u0080\u009d with China. Trump told reporters Friday there was no need to work out a trade deal with China before the 2020 election because the American economy is \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery strong\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 despite mounting fears about a recession. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not looking for a partial deal; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking for a complete deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople know that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing a great job. ... We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not being affected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, farmers are struggling. Net farm income in America has plunged by nearly half\u00c2\u00a0over the last five years from $123 billion in 2013 to $63 billion last year. Hansen said loan delinquencies and farm bankruptcies are up in his state. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been this bad since the early \u00e2\u0080\u009980s,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Farm organization leaders agree that America needed a new trade deal with China \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agreed with Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach. National Farmers Union head Roger Johnson believes that the president has so badly botched negotiations that China is now a \u00e2\u0080\u009clost market\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it will take \u00e2\u0080\u009cdecades\u00e2\u0080\u009d to repair the damage. China needs to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cheld to account\u00e2\u0080\u009d for trade relationships and behavior, Johnson said in a\u00c2\u00a0KFGO radio interview last month. But he said that Trump would have been wiser to approach the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second-largest economy with a team of allies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would ... argue that it would be far more effective if we did it with the rest of the world, instead of first ticking off the rest of the world and then trying to do it all by ourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Johnson, whose organization represents some 200,000 family farms, ranches and fishing enterprises in 33 states. Hansen agrees that Trump needed a strategy involving other countries. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play the Lone Ranger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what did Trump do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hansen asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead of isolating China, the first jump out of the chute he isolates America.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even with a trade deal, farmers face a tough road, Hansen warned \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt takes a really long time to develop a market. It takes little time to destroy one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take years to rebuild \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at best.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department will open an antitrust investigation of Facebook Inc, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, marking the fourth recent antitrust probe of the social media company. Facebook also faces probes by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a group of state attorneys general led by New York and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. Large tech companies, including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Google, have increasingly been on the defensive in recent years over lapses such as privacy breaches and outsized market influence. Facebook has faced extra scrutiny tied to how it allowed its platforms to be used during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The company, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has 2.4 billion monthly users, recently paid a $5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 data with defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Facebook declined to comment on Wednesday. Reuters and others reported in June the two federal agencies had divided up responsibility for the companies being investigated, with the Justice Department taking Google and Apple while the FTC looked at Facebook and Amazon. The Justice Department later said it was opening a probe of online platforms. It did not specify which ones, but said it would consider concerns raised about \u00e2\u0080\u009csearch, social media and some retail services online.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Neither agency has revealed the focus of investigations into Facebook, though the Wall Street Journal has reported that the FTC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probe is focused on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acquisitions. The world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest social network has purchased nearly 90 companies since 2003, showed data from S&P Global. The Justice Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antitrust chief likewise told a tech conference in August that the government is looking at previously approved acquisitions as part of its broad review. This led some industry observers to question whether the two federal investigations would overlap. Lawmakers, in particular Sen. Mike Lee, chair of the SenateJudiciary Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antitrust panel, criticized the appearance of an overlap in a hearing last week. The agencies generally have a practice of meeting to decide who will investigate which matter but the FTC cannot probe certain areas, for example price-fixing. The probe into Facebook by the state attorneys general, announced earlier this month, is being led by New York and also includes Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia. New York Attorney General Letitia James said that investigation would look into whether Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions had endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 choices or increased the price of advertising.

Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order was first reported by The Washington Post and was confirmed to The Associated Press by two people familiar with but not authorized to discuss private conversations. They spoke on the condition of anonymity. Late Monday, an influential group of freshmen Democrats who served in the military and national security before winning office said Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions cut to the core of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defenses. Their views, as centrist lawmakers from previously Republican-held districts where Trump has been popular, hold sway with party leadership. At issue is a summer phone call with Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump is said to have pushed for investigations into Biden. In the days before that call, Trump ordered the aid to Ukraine frozen. Trump has insisted he did nothing wrong and has denied that any requests for help in procuring damaging information about Biden were tied to the aid freeze. The United States began providing military aid to the government of Ukraine shortly after Russia illegally annexed Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Crimean peninsula in 2014. With Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new president still grappling with separatist rebels in the east, the aid has long been viewed as a measure of Washington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s determination to push back against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Democrats, and some Republicans, have urged the White House to be open about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions, which are at the center of a whistleblower complaint. But with no new information from the administration forthcoming, more than a dozen Democrats, including some in House leadership, added their names to those calling for impeachment proceedings. The sudden rush of activity shows the extent to which Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call to the foreign leader, and his subsequent comments about the conversation, are raising further questions about whether the president improperly used his office to pressure another country as a way of helping his own reelection prospects. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote the seven freshmen, who include a former Navy pilot, soldiers, officers and intelligence analysts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do not arrive at this conclusion lightly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the lawmakers wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. The lawmakers include Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Congress on Monday pressed for full disclosure of a whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint about Trump and pushed the White House to release a transcript of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with the Ukraine president. The president has acknowledged the phone call. On Monday, he said he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to give money to Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if there were corruption issues. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very important to talk about corruption,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump told reporters as he opened meetings at the United Nations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is, is corrupt?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Later Monday, Trump denied telling the Ukraine president that his country would only get U.S. aid if it investigated Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The fresh calls for impeachment proceedings come as House Democrats are heading into a closed-door meeting Tuesday with Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi and her leadership team on the various oversight committees are considering bringing forward a resolution that will put the House on the record on this matter, according to a Democratic leadership aide unauthorized to discuss the private talks. The aide was granted anonymity. Still, Democrats remained divided on moving forward with an effort to impeach Trump. Pelosi has resisted calls for impeachment and is sticking with her position that Congress must not start formal proceedings unless the American public demands it. However, Pelosi said Sunday that unless the administration provides more information to Congress by the scheduled Thursday hearing at the intelligence committee, its officials \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump has sought, without evidence, to implicate Biden and his son Hunter in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son. The matter is under new scrutiny following the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mid-August complaint, which followed Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 call with Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president. The person who filed the complaint did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, according to a person familiar with the matter. Lawmakers are demanding details of the complaint, but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. He is set to testify Thursday before the House. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see the transcript,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with the Ukraine president. The chairmen of the House intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Government Reform committees are threatening to subpoena Secretary of State Mike Pompeo if he does not produce information about whether Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, inappropriately tried to influence the Ukraine government for political gain. Meanwhile, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called on Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to investigate the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint. In a letter to McConnell, he said that the Republicans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009csee no evil, hear no evil\u00e2\u0080\u009d attitude toward the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions \u00e2\u0080\u009cis unacceptable and must change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions are grounds for impeachment, but said he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have called a foreign leader to discuss a rival. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he should have raised the topic of Joe Biden with the Ukraine president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rubio said. McConnell said Monday the matter is best left behind closed doors in the classified setting of the intelligence committee, though he did push into the spotlight his own role in securing the Ukraine aid. McConnell said he had been \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersonally pressuring\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Trump administration this summer in calls to Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to release the U.S. aid money. Trump said Monday he may, or may not, release details or a transcript of the call but has stressed that foreign leaders should feel free to speak frankly with an American president without fear that the details of their conversations will later be disclosed. Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings in April 2014, two months after Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Russia-friendly former president was ousted by protesters and as Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government. The move immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration. ___ Associated Press writers Alan Fram, Matthew Daly, Michael Balsamo, Laurie Kellman and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.",

      "author": "Hayley Miller",
      "content": " Data for Progress, a left-learning think tank, is launching a project to raise money for Democrats from swing states who support impeaching President Donald Trump in an effort to protect their congressional seats in 2020. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cImpeach The Motherfucker Already\u00e2\u0080\u009d fund will benefit House Democrats whose support for impeachment could result in an even tougher uphill battle to reelection since their districts aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t staunchly Democratic and could swing red in 2020. At least 16 Democratic campaigns are poised to benefit from the project, with DFP considering adding more as additional lawmakers back impeachment. Contributions will be evenly divided among the campaigns, or individuals can choose how to allocate their donations, according to the fund\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf swing seat Democrats lose after supporting impeachment, the establishment will say they should have stayed silent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d tweeted DFP co-founder Sean McElwee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to make sure they have the resources to win.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A handful of the freshman lawmakers listed on the fund, including Reps. Katie Porter (Calif.) and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell\u00c2\u00a0(Fla.), endorsed impeachment as early as June. Others voiced their support in July after Robert Mueller testified before Congress about his Russia investigation. Several more came out in support amid recent reports that Trump repeatedly pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in July to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic front-runner in the race to challenge Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reelection. Reps. Elissa Slotkin\u00c2\u00a0(Mich.),\u00c2\u00a0Elaine Luria\u00c2\u00a0(Va.) and Abigail Spanberger\u00c2\u00a0(Va.) were part of a group of seven freshman House Democrats to pen an op-ed in The Washington Post on Monday urging Democratic leadership to open an impeachment inquiry in light of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Ukraine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After months of resisting calls to purse impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) will reportedly announce a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump on Tuesday. DFP chose Democrats for the fund based on how strongly their districts supported Trump in 2016, which likely made them the most hesitant to endorse impeachment, McElwee told HuffPost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a lot of concern coming from the establishment of the party that [impeachment] is going to hurt our ability to win the House and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I do think ...\u00c2\u00a0there would be a powerful narrative coming out of the establishment like, \u00e2\u0080\u0099Ah, we never should have impeached\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d if some of these Democrats lose reelection. The project, which raised over $3,000 within three hours of launching, was named for Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-N.Y.) and her rousing if controversial speech in January, in which she vowed Democrats would \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeach the motherfucker.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt had a nice ring to it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0McElwee said of the project\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want this to be something that is data-driven but we also want to convey the moral relevance of the issue, which is we need to impeach the motherfucker.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": " During a meeting with President Donald Trump\u00c2\u00a0on Wednesday,\u00c2\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to be uncomfortable with some of the claims made by Trump and flat-out said he did not want to be involved in U.S. elections. Trump and Zelensky sat before reporters to discuss a\u00c2\u00a0call summary released earlier in the day from a phone conversation between the two on July 25. On that call, Trump asked Zelensky to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo us a favor\u00e2\u0080\u009d just after Zelensky thanked Trump for the military aid the U.S. provided to his country. The request carried an implicit threat that U.S. military aid to Ukraine was at stake if Zelensky did not comply \u00e2\u0080\u0095 which is now the central element of the\u00c2\u00a0Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 effort to impeach the president. The July conversation included Trump asking Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and his son Hunter, and to investigate a conspiracy theory that the Democratic National Committee servers that Russia hacked in 2016 to aid Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign were not actually hacked by Russia. Speaking in front of reporters Wednesday, Zelensky was asked if Trump had pressured him to investigate Biden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you read everything.\u00c2\u00a0I think you read text.\u00c2\u00a0I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be involved to democratic open... elections,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zelensky replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cElections of U.S.A.\u00c2\u00a0No,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, we had, I think, good phone call.\u00c2\u00a0It was normal.\u00c2\u00a0We spoke about many things, and I \u00e2\u0080\u0095 so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump chimed in to say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn other words, no pressure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zelensky awkwardly begs not to be pulled into American election. pic.twitter.com/4egMjP89vF Later during their appearance together, Trump expressed hope that Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan get together and solve your problem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zelensky appeared uncomfortable and looked off into the distance as Trump spoke: OMG \u00e2\u0080\u0094 get a load of the look on Zelensky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face as Trump tells him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI really hope that you and President Putin can get together and solve your problem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d pic.twitter.com/IIefxLdXvB The \u00e2\u0080\u009cproblem\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump referred to is that Putin ordered his military to seize Crimea from Ukraine in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, and then illegally annexed the country that year. With the approval of the European Parliament and NATO, Russia was condemned and suspended from the planned G-8 summit in Sochi in 2015. Following the suspension, the Russian Federation permanently decided to leave the G-8 in January 2017.",

      "content": "HOUSTON - U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared a stage and showered each other with praise on Sunday at a \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowdy, Modi!\u00e2\u0080\u009d rally attended by upward of 50,000 people, a rare mass showing for a foreign leader on American soil. Trump, calling the gathering a \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofoundly historic event,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was greeted with a standing ovation by the Indian-American crowd and his speech was interrupted several times by roars of approval. The U.S. leader hailed the India-U.S. relationship and the Indian-American community as he reached out to an ethnic group that voted overwhelmingly against him in 2016. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou uphold our values, you uplift our communities and you are truly proud to be American and we are truly proud to have you as Americans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump the crowd. Modi began his talk inside the NRG Stadium, home of the Houston Texans football team, with a loud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowdy my friends!\u00e2\u0080\u009d In his remarks delivered in Hindi, Modi said that he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpatient to take the country to new heights\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoday the buzz word in India is development.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The event has given Modi, a nationalist facing international criticism over a recent crackdown in disputed Kashmir, a chance to energize his relationship with Indian-Americans who are active political supporters. Jubilant supporters dressed in everything from ornate saris to simple dhotis and even a few cowboy hats waved American and Indian flags, chanted \u00e2\u0080\u009cModi! Modi!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and munched on concession stand snacks that included Indian staples of samosas and naan breads - along with nachos. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday we celebrate our community and its importance in Houston and all America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ketan Inamdar, who works in the administration of Houston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic Mayor Sylvester Turner, and painted an American flag on his right cheek and an Indian one on the left. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump is very welcome here today. This event is to build harmony and love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, standing just in front of the dais. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRace, religion and political parties don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter today.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Houston is a rare Democratic stronghold in Republican-dominated Texas and serves as the economic anchor of a state that will be critical to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2020 re-election bid. Polls show tepid support by Indian-American voters, some 75% of whom voted for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in 2016. But organizers of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowdy, Modi!\u00e2\u0080\u009d event that was kicked off with a 90-minute cultural program featuring 400 costumed dancers, were delighted to welcome Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis presence is an indication of his support and endorsement of the strengthening of India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relations with America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Preeti Dawra, a spokeswoman for the Texas India Forum that organized the event. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis event is about strengthening those ties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was the first time Modi, who heads the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, addressed a large crowd in the United States, which is home to about 4 million Indian-Americans including about 300,000 in Houston and nearby Dallas, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census data. Some 19,000 people turned out for a similar event in New York in 2014, and Indian-American volunteers living in U.S. suburbs helped run a telephone blitz of voters in India in the run-up to Modi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s May re-election campaign. Modi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit to Houston comes ahead of this week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s U.N. General Assembly in New York and amid a particularly tense time on the subcontinent. The Indian leader further strained long-simmering relations with Pakistan last month by revoking the partial autonomy enjoyed by Muslim-majority Kashmir, which both nuclear-armed countries claim. Modi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move has been met by international criticism. Pakistan has condemned the crackdown and its Prime Minister Imran Khan warned it would drive more of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Muslims into extremism. Members of India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s religious minority Sikh and Muslim groups planned noisy demonstrations near the stadium to protest Modi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kashmir policy. The U.S.-India relationship on trade and tariffs is rocky, though Trump and Modi appear to have strong personal ties. Devesh Kapur, director of Asia Programs at Johns Hopkins University, who has written a book on Indian-Americans, said that while the rally has symbolic value for both leaders, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely by itself to impact thorny trade issues ... but it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kapur also forecast little improvement regarding Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standing with Indian-Americans. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard-line policies on immigration ... have hardly endeared (him) to the community,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kapur said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAppearing with PM Modi might mildly help but certainly not reverse the community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall pro-Democrat leanings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

Two bracelets, a necklace, a ring and earrings worth $236,000 were taken from a 42nd-floor apartment while the female resident was away from June to early September, police said. A $117,000 diamond bracelet was stolen from a 59th-floor apartment while the resident, who owns an art gallery in the city, was on vacation in early September. Both thefts were reported to police early this month. As of Monday, investigators hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t identified any suspects and were still looking into everyone who had access to the building. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear if the thefts were related. There was no sign of a break-in at either place, a source told The New York Post, which was the first to report the story. Investigators suspect an inside job. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not somebody breaking into the building or roaming the halls, trying the doors until they find one that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a source told the newspaper. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s triplex penthouse and his Trump Organization headquarters are located in the same building. Trump stayed in his Fifth Avenue home on Sunday and Monday night for his visit to the United Nations. Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent and CNN contributor, said the thefts raised concerns about a threat from an insider at Trump Tower, which is always protected by the Secret Service.",

      "content": " If you violate Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules, Facebook can force you to remove the offending content, or temporarily ban you, or permanently ban you. If a politician violates those same rules, Facebook now officially won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do squat. In a speech at the Atlantic Festival in Washington Tuesday, Facebook Vice President Nick Clegg said the company will, by default, consider everything politicians post to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cnewsworthy content\u00e2\u0080\u009d that is governed by different rules than most of the rest of the site. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom now on we will treat speech from politicians as newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Clegg said in a\u00c2\u00a0blog. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis means that if someone makes a statement or shares a post which breaks our community standards we will still allow it on our platform if we believe the public interest in seeing it outweighs the risk of harm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In practice, this will mean denials that World War II\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Holocaust occurred would be permitted \u00e2\u0080\u0095 so long as it was a politician making the thoroughly bogus and discredited claim that Nazi Germany did not commit the genocide of an estimated six million Jews. Asked about such a claim, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to HuffPost that it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be seen as breaking the site\u00e2\u0080\u0099s community standards and would not be subject to fact-checking. The spokesperson told HuffPost the company decided to make the change ahead of upcoming elections globally and in the U.S. Under the policy, content posted by politicians doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be accurate or true. Indeed, for more than a year Facebook has exempted politicians from scrutiny otherwise applied by third-party fact-checkers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers, and we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Clegg. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, there are exceptions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBroadly speaking they are two-fold: where speech endangers people; and where we take money, which is why we have more stringent rules on advertising than we do for ordinary speech and rhetoric.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear how serious Facebook is about enforcing that first exception. Earlier this month, Texas state Rep. Briscoe Cain (R)\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0sent a death threat to his fellow Texan, former Rep. Beto O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke, on Twitter after the Democratic presidential candidate proposed a mandatory gun buyback of some semiautomatic weapons. Twitter deleted Cain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tweet two hours later, explaining it violated the site\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terms because it threatened violence. Asked Tuesday if Facebook would have done the same, the spokesperson declined to make a judgment.",

      "content": "BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top steward of public lands has recused himself from work involving dozens of former clients following conflict of interest allegations from Democratic lawmakers and environmental advocates, federal officials disclosed Wednesday. Acting Bureau of Land Management Director William \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerry\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pendley is a former property rights attorney who has argued for selling off public lands and railed against what he has labelled the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctyranny\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the federal government. Pendley said in a Wednesday email to his staff obtained by The Associated Press that he wanted to set an example for the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 9,000 employees by avoiding the potential conflicts. He agreed not to participate in matters involving 57 entities and individuals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from farming and mining organizations to an energy company seeking to drill on land adjacent to Glacier National Park, according to documents released by officials. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand that preserving a culture of ethical compliance within the BLM begins with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pendley wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have also established a rigorous screening process to ensure that I will remain in full compliance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The recusals are generally effective for two years and retroactive to the date of his mid-July appointment. Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana has sharply criticized Pendley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past calls to sell off public lands and called his appointment an end-run around the Senate because no confirmation hearings were held. Tester said in a statement that Pendley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recusal from decisions related to a disputed energy lease in Montana was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpositive step,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but more answers were needed about his record. Others in Congress have voiced similar concerns. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact remains that he has repeatedly advocated for selling off our public lands to the highest bidder, which should have disqualified him outright from leading the BLM,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tester said. The BLM leader said last month that his longtime advocacy for selling public lands was irrelevant because his boss, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, opposes the wholesale sale of public lands. The Trump administration already has moved to weaken protections for public lands, including easing restrictions on oil and gas exploration. BLM officials last week said the agency was moving its headquarters from Washington to an office building in Colorado that also houses oil and gas organizations, drawing criticism from environmental groups. Among Pendley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past clients when he ran the conservative Mountain States Legal Foundation was Solenex LLC, a Louisiana-based energy company that has been seeking to drill in the remote and mountainous Badger-Two Medicine area of northwestern Montana. The Badger-Two-Medicine area is considered sacred to the Blackfoot tribes of the U.S. and Canada, and Solenex is fighting in court against the Interior Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to cancel an energy lease that that the company has held for decades. Tribal officials still hope to work with the Trump administration on the issue, but Pendley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recusals do not eliminate their apprehensions, said John Murray, historic preservation officer for Montana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Blackfeet Nation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was 100 percent on the other side of the table,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Murray said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese guys do all kinds of lobbying and meeting and all this stuff behind closed doors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The lengthy recusal list touches on some of the BLM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major oversight responsibilities, naming organizations such as the National Mining Association and several state farm bureaus. Agency spokesman Jeff Krauss said that would not prevent Pendley from effectively leading the bureau. Three southern Utah counties that supported President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s downsizing of two sprawling national monuments in the state also appear on the list. He was the attorney representing San Juan, Kane and Garfield counties when they sought to intervene in lawsuits by conservation and tribal groups challenging the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions. A Pendley supporter in the state said criticisms of his past affiliations were unfair and that environmental groups would never be happy because they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want anyone to touch public lands. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what the BLM needs: A person that will manage public lands for the original purpose of multiple use,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Utah cattle rancher and Garfield County Commissioner Leland Pollock said.",

      "content": "SAN DIEGO (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Former California Rep. Darrell Issa plans to run against indicted fellow GOP Congressman Duncan Hunter, The Associated Press has learned. Larry Wilske, a retired Navy SEAL also running for Hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat, told the AP on Wednesday that Issa told him he will enter the race. Issa scheduled a news conference in Hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s San Diego-area district on Thursday. Wilske said he plans to drop out as result and support Issa. The former nine-term congressman formed an exploratory committee last month and was widely known to be considering a run in the staunchly Republican district east of San Diego. Issa retired from his long stint in Congress before the 2018 election in a neighboring district that he narrowly won two years earlier. Wilske said Issa, 65, is a safer bet that Hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s district will remain in Republican hands, and his many years in the House pave the way for him to become a ranking member on committees. El Cajon Mayor Bill Wells, who also was running for Hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat, said he too plans to bow out and back Issa. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one in the best position to win and get something done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wells said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to get back to the business of having a presence in Washington.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hunter has said he has no plans to step down despite being indicted. He is scheduled to be tried in January for allegedly siphoning campaign money for personal use. The 42-year-old Marine combat veteran is also being challenged by Republican Carl DeMaio, a radio host and former San Diego city councilman with broad name recognition, and Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, who came within 3.4 percentage points of unseating Hunter in November. Issa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entry is expected to make it one of the most closely watched congressional contests in the country. Republicans have a big advantage in voter registration in California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 50th district, which covers east San Diego County and a small part of southern Riverside County. Hunter won a sixth term last year, barely two months after he and his wife were charged with using more than $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses ranging from groceries to golf trips and family vacations. Margaret Hunter has pleaded guilty to one corruption count and agreed to cooperate with investigators. Hunter, whose father represented the district in Congress for 28 years, has pleaded not guilty and framed the charges as political attack by prosecutors sympathetic to Democrat Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 presidential bid.",

Trump claiming this morning that his effort to strong-arm Ukraine was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfectly fine and routine conversation\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a disturbing admission that his malfeasance has become \u00e2\u0080\u009croutine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Democracy is in the ICU, and some of the hospital staff are trying to smother it with a pillow. A series of Shaub\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tweets on the issue followed Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message Saturday morning defending his July call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Yet several newspapers reported that Trump pressured Zelensky to launch an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter. Just weeks earlier, Trump had suspended some $400 million in military aid to the nation, The Washington Post reported, raising suspicions that Trump may have used the withheld funds to leverage compliance with his request that would help his reelection.\u00c2\u00a0(The Ukrainian foreign minister said Saturday: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think there was no pressure\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call to Zelensky.)

Trump has alleged that Biden, while vice president, worked to shield a Ukrainian company linked to his son from a corruption probe. But a Ukrainian official said earlier this year that investigators found no evidence of any wrongdoing by Biden or his son. The latest revelations have triggered calls to impeach Trump if he indeed wielded U.S. might to mobilize a foreign power against U.S. citizens to affect an American election.\u00c2\u00a0Biden has called Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acts an \u00e2\u0080\u009cabuse of power.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t denied he discussed Biden with Zelensky and told reporters Friday: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter what was discussed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shaub sees lack of action against Trump as a death watch for democracy. Our Lady of She Had a Good Run hospital, where our republic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on death watch, is administered by Senators who love power more than they love America. Our electoral process is what makes us a republic, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fine with Trump soliciting a foreign power to harm it. #betrayal Stop, you partisans, you justifiers of malfeasance, you power-drunk politicians trading love of country for fealty to the corrupter.

      "content": "KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko on Saturday denied suggestions U.S. President Donald Trump had put pressure on Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a phone call in July. In an interview with media outlet Hromadske, Prystaiko said Ukraine was an independent state and would not take sides in U.S. politics even if \u00e2\u0080\u009cin theory\u00e2\u0080\u009d the country was in a position to do so. He added that Kiev appreciated the assistance it received from Washington. On Friday reports by U.S. media outlets said Trump repeatedly pressured Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president to investigate Joe Biden, one of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief political rivals, in a July phone call. The call featured in a classified whistleblower complaint that has sparked a political battle between Democrats warning of a national security threat and Republicans turning it into an attack on Biden, a frontrunner in the field of Democrats seeking to challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Reuters has not confirmed details of the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint. But a source familiar with the matter said it alleged \u00e2\u0080\u009cmultiple acts\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Trump, not just a phone call with a foreign leader. The source requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Zelenskiy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office has so far declined to comment on the allegations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Prystaiko said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump dismissed the Sept. 12 complaint from the whistleblower within the intelligence community as a partisan hit against him. Trump had spoken Zelenskiy less than three weeks before the complaint was filed. Trump is due to meet Zelenskiy during a United Nations gathering in New York. Prystaiko said Zelenskiy had the right to keep conversations with other leaders confidential. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to say that we are an independent state, we have our secrets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he was quoted as saying in the interview. The July 25 call between the leaders is under investigation by three Democratic-led House committees, who want to know if Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, tried to pressure the Ukrainian government into aiding Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election campaign. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Trump urged Zelenskiy about eight times during the call to work with Giuliani to investigate Biden and Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son.

      "content": " A New York judge ordered President Donald Trump\u00c2\u00a0on Friday to provide a videotaped deposition for a lawsuit by protesters accusing Trump Tower guards of assault. One of the guards later joined Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s White House staff and is currently working for the Republican National Committee. The lawsuit was filed by five activists against Trump and his guards who say there were attacked during a peaceful protest outside the Manhattan high-rise four years ago. They were demonstrating against then-candidate Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks about the Black Lives Matter movement and his comments that Mexican immigrants were\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009ccriminals\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009crapists.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The jury in the case that begins Thursday needs the testimony to determine to what extent the guards directly reported to Trump, and if he authorized the actions against protesters. One of the three guards named in the suit, Keith Schiller, was head of security of the Trump Organization and later became director of Oval Office operations under Trump in 2017. After he left the White House that year, Schiller was hired by the Republican National Committee to advise on security for the 2020 convention, according to CNN. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request to quash a subpoena to testify was rejected Friday by Bronx Supreme Court Judge Doris Gonzalez. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo government official, including the executive, is above the law,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gonzalez ruled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with the other defendants is now central to plaintiffs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 prosecution of their claims under the theory of respondeat superior. As such, his testimony is indispensable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump was ordered to provide the testimony by Thursday, but he can appeal or request a delay. During the 2015 confrontation outside Trump Tower, guards told protesters (some of whom were dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes) that the sidewalk was private property \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and pushed them away. Schiller was also captured on videotape (below) angrily ripping away protest signs and striking plaintiff Efrain Galicia in the head when he attempted to retrieve one of them. Schiller struck with \u00e2\u0080\u009ca closed fist on the head with such force it caused (him) to stumble backwards,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the lawsuit states. Schiller argued in an affidavit after the suit was filed that the protesters and their banners were blocking public access to the sidewalks and Trump Tower. He also claimed Galicia grabbed him from behind, and feared he was reaching for Schiller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firearm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI instinctively reacted by turning around ... and striking the person with my open hand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, noting Trump was inside the building at the time. The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction to forbid the Trump security officials from interfering with public protests and are seeking damages. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.",

      "content": "Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\u00c2\u00a0is defending transphobic remarks he made earlier this week, accusing the media of spreading \u00e2\u0080\u009cblatant mischaracterizations\u00e2\u0080\u009d of his statements, according to an email obtained by The Washington Post and Politico. In the memo sent to his staff amid backlash over the comments, Carson said he felt compelled \u00e2\u0080\u009cto set the record straight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d claiming the press had reported the story irresponsibly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring a recent meeting with local staff in San Francisco, I made reference to the fact that I had heard from many women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s groups about the difficulty they were having with women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shelters because sometimes men would claim to be women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis made many of the women feel unsafe, and one of the groups described a situation to me in which \u00e2\u0080\u0098big hairy men\u00e2\u0080\u0099 would come in and have to be accepted into the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shelter even though it made the women in the facility very uncomfortable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Carson argued his \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoint was that we have to permit policies that take into consideration the rights of everybody, including those women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His remarks in San Francisco about access to the shelters for homeless women were first reported on Thursday by the Post after sources at the session with HUD employees told the newspaper about what they heard. According to the story,\u00c2\u00a0Carson raised the concern about \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig, hairy men\u00e2\u0080\u009d infiltrating the shelters, ostensibly referring to transgender women. He allegedly also complained that society no longer understood the dichotomy between men and women. One HUD staffer present told the Post that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe sentiment conveyed was these were not women, and they should not be housed in single-sex shelters \u00e2\u0080\u0095 like we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t force people to accept transgender people in this context because it makes other people uncomfortable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There were reportedly 50 people present at the meeting, one of whom walked out in protest of Carson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments and drew applause from others. Following the report, Democrats including Reps. Joe Kennedy\u00c2\u00a0of Massachusetts and Jennifer Wexton\u00c2\u00a0of Virginia called on Carson to resign, slamming his remarks as \u00e2\u0080\u009csickening\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009crevolting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A spokesman for HUD did not immediately return HuffPost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for comment on Thursday,\u00c2\u00a0but told the Post that Carson \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes not use derogatory language to refer to transgendered individuals. Any reporting to the contrary is false.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Carson has a poor record on transgender rights. His department has proposed changing the 2012 Equal Access Rule to allow federally funded shelters to turn away transgender people on religious grounds. Shortly after Carson took over the department in early 2017, HUD\u00c2\u00a0removed links to documents\u00c2\u00a0that helped emergency shelters comply with agency regulations for serving homeless transgender people. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also made crass comments to argue against transgender people in the military and letting transgender students use bathrooms that match their gender identities.",

      "content": "Sept 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Joseph Kennedy III, a member of the famed political dynasty, on Saturday launched a 2020 primary challenge against fellow Democrat Edward Markey for his U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts. Kennedy, the 38-year-old grandson of former Senator RobertKennedy who was assassinated in 1968 while running for president, has served in the House of Representatives since2013. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a time for waiting, for sitting on the sidelines, or for playing by rules that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work anymore,\u00e2\u0080\u009cKennedy wrote on Twitter on Saturday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the fight of our lives, the fight of my generation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m all in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Markey, 73, who had a long career in the House before filling a vacancy in the Senate in 2013, last won re-election in2014 by a comfortable margin. During his House career, Markey was one of a handful of lawmakers who led the fight for legislation, which narrowly passed the House in 2009, to bring down carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. Kennedy will bring his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s star power to next year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s race, potentially giving Markey one of the toughest contests of his political career. Massachusetts is a strong Democratic state and the winner of the party primary next year is likely to win in the Nov. 3,2020, general election. Other members of the Kennedy family who have won Senate seats, in addition to Robert Kennedy, were his brothers John F.Kennedy and Edward Kennedy. John Kennedy subsequently was elected president in 1960. Edward Kennedy held his Senate seat for nearly 47 years until his death in 2009.(Writing by Daniel Wallis in New YorkEditing by Matthew Lewis)",

      "author": "S.V. Date",
      "content": " When the end came and Republicans told him they could not save him, President Richard Nixon agreed to walk away, in large measure for the good of his party. Forty-five years later, what might the GOP expect from its current president accused of trying to rig a presidential election in his favor, should Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standing deteriorate to a similar level? \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe will burn it to the ground,\u00e2\u0080\u009d predicted one former Trump White House official. And therein lies a further complicating factor for Republicans in Congress and nationally as House Democrats ramp up their impeachment proceedings into Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coercion of Ukraine this summer to investigate his most feared Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loyalty to his party is viewed as paper-thin, at best. While Nixon was a lifelong Republican, having served as President Dwight Eisenhower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president and as a congressman and U.S. senator from California, Trump had little relationship with the GOP before he took it over by winning its presidential nomination in 2016. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll Trump cares about is Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, one of three Republicans challenging Trump for the 2020 nomination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d take down the entire planet if it helped Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Erick Erickson, a prominent conservative radio talk show host and blogger, said Republicans could try to persuade Trump into leaving by pointing out how Nixon eventually came to be seen as an elder statesman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat might induce him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Erickson said, adding that the other option was right out of HBO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cGame of Thrones\u00e2\u0080\u009d series. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOtherwise, I think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to re-create Daenerys Targaryen at King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Landing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In fact, Republican Party officials already have tried once to get him to leave the stage. In the days following the publication in October 2016 of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccess Hollywood\u00e2\u0080\u009d tape \u00e2\u0080\u0095 in which Trump brags that his celebrity allowed him to grab women by the genitals with impunity \u00e2\u0080\u0095 several wanted him to drop out of the presidential race and let running mate Mike Pence move to the top of the ticket. Trump not only refused but also threatened to take every Republican candidate down with him if the party tried to yank the nomination away from him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rented the party for this entire ride,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said former Florida congressman (and former Republican) David Jolly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he would be compelled by an argument for the good of the party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some top Republicans say that GOP senators will never request Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure as their predecessors did with Nixon because Trump commands such undying loyalty from the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voting base. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoot question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said GOP pollster Neil Newhouse. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSenate Republicans will never ask for it. His hardcore base will not leave him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a long way from being anywhere near that situation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Ron Kaufman, a longtime Republican National Committee member from Massachusetts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no analogy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although many Republicans see Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hold over his party as a great strength, Yale School of Medicine psychiatry professor Bandy Lee sees great danger in it to the country. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know that, in any situation, he will think of himself before anyone or anything else\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it became a choice, there may be no limit to what he is willing to bring down in order to salvage his fragile sense of self.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   In November 1972, Richard Nixon won 61% of the popular vote and scored a sweeping Electoral College victory, 520-17, losing only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia in winning a second term. Within months, though, that victory began looking tainted as news reports, and then congressional investigations, showed that burglars paid by Nixon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign had broken into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex a mile west of the White House with the intent of wiretapping it. Nixon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval numbers at the start of his second term, at 68% in one Gallup poll, began to decline. They had fallen below 50% by the time the Senate began formal hearings into the break-in and cover-up in May, 1973, and close to 30% by the time Nixon fired Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox in the infamous \u00e2\u0080\u009cSaturday Night Massacre\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Oct. 20, 1973. The number of Americans who wanted to see him removed from office, nevertheless, remained fairly low. Only 19% wanted him impeached and removed at the start of the Senate hearings. After the Saturday Night Massacre, that figure rose to and then plateaued in the mid-30s. That phenomenon only changed after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered Nixon to release a taped conversation from June 1972, in which he is heard participating in a discussion about ordering the FBI and CIA to end the investigation into the break-in as a matter of national security. Within days, the percentage of Americans who wanted Nixon removed jumped from the low 40s to 57 on Aug. 8, 1974, the day he announced his resignation in a televised address. In some respects, Democrats who want to impeach Trump have much more favorable circumstances than those who sought to remove Nixon. Trump has never been popular with the majority of Americans, either as a candidate or since taking office. His current approval percentages range from the high 30s to low 40s \u00e2\u0080\u0095 where he has been pretty much his entire presidency. Further, Trump already released a rough transcript of the July 25 phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. It documents what Trump had already admitted verbally: that he asked Zelensky to investigate Biden after having blocked $400 million in congressionally approved aid to Ukraine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would like you to do us a favor, though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump told Zelensky. \u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, this is all about the re-election of Donald Trump, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another page out of the Nixon playbook,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rice University presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see Trump doing the same abuse of power in getting information on Biden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d News of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s language in the call rapidly pushed dozens of House Democrats who had opposed impeachment, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, into backing an opening of an inquiry. And that, in turn, has helped move public opinion from opposing impeachment to favoring at least the start of that process. The web site 538 has found a measurable swing in favor of impeachment, from 51% opposing it and 40% in favor in mid-September, to 47% in favor and 45% against it today. Brinkley said he has found the parallels between Nixon and Trump astonishing. Both abused the power of their office in efforts to win their re-elections, he said, and both then used their office and aides to try to cover it up. The big difference is that money from Nixon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign fund paid the Watergate burglars \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and he then he approved using such funds to buy their silence \u00e2\u0080\u0095 while Trump used hundreds of millions of American taxpayer dollars as leverage against the Ukrainian president, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny that everyone thought the modern Republican Party was the party of Reagan, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really the party of Nixon. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about cronyism and the destruction of your enemies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brinkley said.   Yet even opposing a fundamentally less liked president who has committed an arguably worse offense might not be enough for Democrats who hope to remove Trump from office. Nixon was contemplating resigning from the time he lost the Supreme Court decision on the \u00e2\u0080\u009csmoking gun\u00e2\u0080\u009d tape. But having his party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elder statesman, Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, come to the White House with the Republican leaders of both congressional chambers to tell him that he had maybe a dozen GOP senators still supporting him likely sealed his decision to step down. That, of course, was a different era. American politics in 2019 is not what it was in 1974. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much, much different, the political environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Axelrod, the Democratic consultant who helped lead former President Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2008 campaign. During Watergate, Goldwater and other Republicans were much more inclined to cross their president than any GOP senators are today. At that time, Tennessee Sen. Howard Baker was the ranking member of the Senate committee investigating the Watergate scandal and played a key role in the probe. And then there are the differences between the two presidents and the media landscape, Axelrod said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNixon was not nearly as brazen as Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Axelrod said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNor did he have Fox News and Breitbart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam Nunberg, a longtime former political adviser to Trump, said a more important point is that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hold over today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican Party base is far more complete than Nixon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever was. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the Senate Republicans approached the president to give the president a resignation ultimatum, the uproar by the president, conservative media and his supporters would lead to the near annihilation of the Republican Party in the 2020 election that would last for multiple future cycles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nunberg said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Trump goes down, then the Republican Party goes down. This is not a symbiotic relationship. The Republicans need Trump. Trump can break them in half.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A more worrisome point, Trump critics say, is Nixon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loyalty to his party and his country compared with Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. In the end, Nixon showed that both meant more to him than hanging onto the presidency \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and it is not at all clear that Trump shares those priorities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump has a lifetime of historical decisions that proves he only protects himself and his personal interests,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kendal Unruh, the former GOP activist who led the effort to dump Trump as the nominee on the floor of the 2016 convention. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe actually enjoys burning things down. He rules by chaos because when everyone else is out of control, it puts him into control. He will continue to demand that those in the GOP yield to him their loyalty, and they will oblige.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet even if more damning facts emerge through the impeachment proceedings and enough Republicans come around to the view that continuing to support Trump is riskier to their political futures than abandoning him, that still leaves the question of how to get Trump to accept that decision. Lee, who along with a number of other mental health professionals wrote the book \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Dangerous Case of Donald Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his recent behavior suggests he would be highly unlikely to follow Nixon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s precedent and leave office quietly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDonald Trump could be the hardest to remove from office, refusing to accept any decision and inciting violence from his followers, if not wage a war that places the world in danger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lee said. She recommended approaching him gingerly, and said that making it seem that his prize for leaving would be nearly as \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrandiose\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the presidency itself would be the only way of getting him to do so. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow we handle the situation is critical from a psychological perspective,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt needs to be done delicately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Nick Visser",
      "content": " The spate of mysterious lung illnesses linked to vaping are most likely caused by noxious chemical fumes, a team of doctors at the Mayo Clinic said Wednesday. The findings, published in\u00c2\u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine, are the latest effort by health officials to determine why hundreds of people across the country have been hospitalized in recent months with dangerous and sometimes fatal lung issues. But the results are a far cry from a silver bullet and appear to only nullify initial reports that speculated patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lungs were getting clogged and damaged by the oils that were being inhaled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems to be some kind of direct chemical injury, similar to what one might see with exposures to toxic chemical fumes, poisonous gases and toxic agents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brandon Larsen, a surgical pathologist at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, said in a statement. The Mayo effort was the first formal study of tissue samples from patients who fell ill after vaping. Two of those samples came from people who died. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone should recognize that #vaping is not a wise thing to be doing, and I think our research supports that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Brandon Larsen, M.D., Ph.D., the senior author of a Mayo Clinic study on vaping-associated lung injury. https://t.co/cFkQHkIwUJ @NEJM @CDCgov #pneumonitis #THC pic.twitter.com/YBfD7gkQDZ Larsen later told The New York Times the injuries resembled toxic chemical exposure and look similar to the lungs of \u00e2\u0080\u009can unfortunate worker in an industrial accident where a big barrel of toxic chemicals spills, and that person is exposed to toxic fumes and there is a chemical burn in the airways.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week it had confirmed the mysterious lung injuries in at least 805 people from 46 states. The agency said at the time at least 12 people had died, but more states have reported fatalities in recent days, bringing the total to at least 16. The findings from the Mayo Clinic contradict\u00c2\u00a0earlier results from researchers who had initially linked the illnesses to a rare ailment called lipoid pneumonia that typically occurs when people accidentally inhale oil into their lungs, according to Reuters. Health officials in New York had also linked the vaping ailments to a chemical in an oil derived from vitamin E last month. But the Mayo researchers said that they saw no evidence in the 17 lung biopsies they examined. The samples were taken from 13 men and four women, and 71% had vaped marijuana or cannabis oils. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t discount the potential role of lipids, we have not seen anything to suggest this is a problem caused by lipid accumulation in the lungs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Larsen said. Officials have yet to identify what is causing the lung damage in vape users, and the CDC said last week that no single e-cigarette product or vaping substance had been linked to all of the cases. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a public health crisis, and a lot of people are working frantically around the clock to find out what the culprit or culprits could be \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and what chemicals may be responsible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Larsen said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone should recognize that vaping is not without potential risks, including life-threatening risks, and I think our research supports that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Though federal health officials have been warning Americans to avoid vaping while they determine what components of e-cigarettes may be to blame, some cities and states have taken it upon themselves to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes to curtail their use. Michigan was the first to announce a statewide ban on some of the products, and New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island followed suit later in September.",

      "content": "President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani told CNN on Wednesday night that some of the documents in a packet the State Department inspector general handed to Congress just hours earlier had come from him. The revelation was the latest twist in the ongoing turmoil over Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with the leader of Ukraine in July. CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report came the same day the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watchdog, Steve Linick, sent an urgent message to Congress saying he needed to meet and give them copies of documents related to the Ukraine call. Democrats were reportedly prepared for some kind of a bombshell but instead were handed a 40-page packet of documents that included conspiracy theories and news clippings. The pages also referenced a slew of names related to the scandal: Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, Hunter Biden and George Soros. The packet had a return address that matched that of the Manhattan office of Giuliani, who later confirmed that he was responsible for their production, telling The New York Times they came from a \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofessional investigator who works for my company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The documents prompted consternation from top Democrats, who issued public calls that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo explain how such misinformation made it to the top levels of government. Lawmakers also said the packet only provided more evidence that the White House had \u00e2\u0080\u009csought to use the machinery of the State Department to further the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal political interests.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are now in possession of this packet of propaganda and disinformation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) told Reuters on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe real question is where did it come from and how did it end up in our lap?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The chairs of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees released a joint statement earlier Wednesday expressing concerns about the \u00e2\u0080\u009curgent\u00e2\u0080\u009d briefing. The statement said the meeting with Linick raised \u00e2\u0080\u009ctroubling questions\u00e2\u0080\u009d about alleged efforts by the Trump administration to target former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden and Yovanovitch, who was removed from her ambassadorship in May after Trump allies accused her of participating in an alleged Ukrainian attempt to support Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 presidential campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe documents provided by the Inspector General included a package of disinformation, debunked conspiracy theories, and baseless allegations in an envelope marked \u00e2\u0080\u0098White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and containing folders labeled \u00e2\u0080\u0098Trump Hotel,\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u009d the chairs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 statement read. Giuliani told CNN that he had \u00e2\u0080\u009crouted\u00e2\u0080\u009d what he said was an \u00e2\u0080\u009coutline\u00e2\u0080\u009d of allegations against Biden and Yovanovitch to Pompeo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office in March. He also reportedly sent details about his talks from earlier this year with top Ukrainian prosecutors who helped give him information for his outline. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey told me they were going to investigate it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Giuliani told CNN. The attorney and former New York mayor has become one of the central figures in the political whirlwind over Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, on July 25. During the conversation, Trump repeatedly pressed his counterpart to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company for five years. Before the call, the Trump administration had been withholding military aid from Ukraine. A whistleblower complaint about the call mentioned Giuliani multiple times, and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer has said in television interviews that he met with Ukrainian operatives. But in recent days he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moved to minimize his role in the scandal, saying he got involved only at the behest of the State Department. House Democrats have been moving quickly to investigate the Ukraine call as part of their impeachment inquiry while Trump has raged about the effort. This week the president called the inquiry a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoup\u00e2\u0080\u009d and has been refusing to answer some reporters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 questions about the information that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come out of transcripts of the call.",

      "author": "Dominique Mosbergen",
      "content": " Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer, has reportedly been talking with the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imprisoned former campaign chairman Paul Manafort in an effort to bolster a debunked\u00c2\u00a0conspiracy theory he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been touting involving Ukraine and Hillary Clinton. Citing an interview with Giuliani himself, The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the former New York mayor admitted to contacting Manafort via the prisoner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer several times in recent months. Manafort is serving a 7\u00c2\u00bd-year term in a Pennsylvania federal prison for bank fraud, tax fraud and other charges stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Giuliani said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d reached out to Manafort to determine the veracity of a secret black ledger that allegedly recorded illegal cash payments to Manafort from former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Giuliani told the Post that he was keen to look into the matter because he believes the black ledger never existed and was concocted by Democratic operatives \u00e2\u0080\u0095 with the support of U.S. authorities \u00e2\u0080\u0095 in order to take Manafort down. The Post\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report offers a glimpse into the efforts that Giuliani \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also become a\u00c2\u00a0central figure in the House impeachment investigation related to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controversial phone call with current Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has undertaken to falsely reframe the narrative of the 2016 election. Specifically, Giuliani has been pushing a conspiracy theory\u00c2\u00a0that it was Ukraine, and not Russia, that interfered in the election. Mueller and the U.S. intelligence community concluded Russia plotted to influence the election to help Trump win. On Monday, Giuliani told Fox News\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Sean Hannity that Ukrainian officials had conspired with Democrats, including Clinton and former U.S. President Barack Obama, to dig up dirt on Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWake up, Democrats. You are covering up corruption,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Giuliani told Hannity, hours after being issued a subpoena by House Democrats for records related to his dealings with Ukraine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the time this is over, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be the party of corruption,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Giuliani said. The Post\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expos\u00c3\u00a9 on Giuliani corroborates earlier reports by The New York Times and NYR Daily about the attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s correspondence with Manafort. The Times reported last month that Giuliani had \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsulted with Manafort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers about ways to raise doubts about the ledger as a means to question the special counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Investigative journalist Murray Waas, writing for NYR Daily, reported that Giuliani had spoken to Manafort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal team on at least three occasions about \u00e2\u0080\u009chow the White House was pushing a narrative that the Democratic National Committee, Democratic donors, and Ukrainian government officials had \u00e2\u0080\u0098colluded\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d against Trump in 2016. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis story has since been debunked as baseless, though that has not prevented Trump, Giuliani, and other surrogates in conservative media from repeatedly pushing the story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Waas noted. The Manafort-linked ledger that Giuliani was interested in was first reported by the Times in 2016. The ledger allegedly recorded $12.7 million in illegal cash payments from Yanukovych \u00e2\u0080\u0095 described as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cstooge\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Russian leader Vladimir Putin \u00e2\u0080\u0095 to Manafort; the news prompted questions about the Trump campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential ties to the Kremlin and ultimately led to Manafort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resignation. Giuliani told the Post that he recently asked Manafort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer whether \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere really [was] a black book.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manafort responded that there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, Giuliani claimed \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a response that the attorney suggested supported his theory about the ledger having been invented by U.S. authorities as a pretext to open a case against Manafort. As the Post noted, however, the FBI already had a case against Manafort long before the 2016 campaign, and the ledger was mentioned neither by the special counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office nor by Manafort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense team during his criminal trials. The Post\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report about Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s correspondence with Manafort dropped the same day that the attorney admitted to providing documents to the State Department that included conspiracy theories related to Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and Marie Yovanovitch, who until recently was the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. The State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watchdog, Steve Linick, provided Congress on Wednesday with a 40-page packet of documents that he said was related to the State Department and Ukraine. The chairs of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees later said in a statement\u00c2\u00a0that the packet contained \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisinformation, debunked conspiracy theories, and baseless allegations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese documents ... reinforce concern that the President and his allies sought to use the machinery of the State Department to further the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal political interests,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the three committee chairs wrote. Giuliani admitted to CNN that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sent some of the documents in the packet, including an\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009coutline\u00e2\u0080\u009d of allegations against Biden and Yovanovitch, to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office. Giuliani claimed Pompeo had contacted him about the documents and had told him the State Department was \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoing to investigate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": " President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested China should investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden, appearing to openly ask another foreign government to influence an American election, even as Congress investigates him for allegedly pressuring Ukraine into doing the same thing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump told reporters Thursday. The president made the suggestion while defending himself against House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 impeachment proceedings, launched after Trump appeared to pressure Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden, whose son Hunter has had business dealings in the country. Trump on Thursday continued to openly call for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\u00c2\u00a0He\u00c2\u00a0first made the request in a July 25 call\u00c2\u00a0that became public after an anonymous whistleblower filed a complaint, which is now the centerpiece of the House impeachment inquiry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they were honest about it, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d start a major investigation into the Bidens. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suggestion comes amid GOP scrutiny at Hunter Biden joining the board of a Chinese private equity fund in 2013, while his father was vice president. The younger Biden accompanied the then-vice president on an official trip to China during that time. In response to the latest comments, Biden and his campaign said in a Thursday statement it was yet another example of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009congoing abuse of power.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat Donald Trump just said on the South Lawn of the White House was this election\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equivalent of his infamous \u00e2\u0080\u0098Russia, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re listening\u00e2\u0080\u0099 moment from 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign said, referencing Trump asking Russia to investigate 2016 presidential opponent Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emails. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe White House itself has admitted that Donald Trump tried to bully a foreign country into lying about the domestic opponent he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s afraid to look in the eye next November.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s angry defense against the impeachment proceedings has included trying to portray these unprecedented requests for foreign intervention in U.S. elections as routine. The president has previously defended the call \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in which, according to the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s summary, he dangled military aid in exchange for the investigation into his political rival \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca perfect conversation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a thing wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can you impeach somebody on that conversation?\u00e2\u0080\u009d While defending himself, Trump has also falsely accused both the whistleblower and House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), leading the investigation into Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call, of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctreason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During a contentious press conference Wednesday, in which he appeared belligerent and red-faced, Trump repeatedly badgered Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason, when Mason tried to ask exactly what Trump wanted from Zelensky. While calling Mason \u00e2\u0080\u009crude\u00e2\u0080\u009d and criticizing \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe corrupt media,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump continued to defend the call and claimed that \u00e2\u0080\u009cBiden and his son are stone-cold crooked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": " A Coast Guard lieutenant with white supremacist views pleaded guilty to Thursday to four gun and drug charges in a case that tested the federal government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to charge heavily armed domestic extremists plotting terrorist attacks. Christopher Hasson, a 50-year-old who resided in a Maryland suburb of D.C., was arrested back in February on gun and drug charges. But federal prosecutors said those charges were just the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctip of the iceberg,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that Hasson had been planning to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmurder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Hasson, federal prosecutors wrote\u00c2\u00a0in a court filing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a domestic terrorist, bent on committing acts dangerous to human life that are intended to affect governmental conduct.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hasson pleaded guilty to four counts, according to federal court records:\u00c2\u00a0unlawful possession of unregistered firearm silencers, unlawful possession of firearm silencers unidentified by serial number, possession of firearms by unlawful user or addict of a controlled substance, and possession of a controlled substance. The addict-in-possession charge was also used against a neo-Nazi in D.C., who was\u00c2\u00a0released\u00c2\u00a0last month after spending about 10 months in jail. The United States does not have a federal law that broadly outlaws acts of domestic terrorism, and federal prosecutors have generally been hesitant to call domestic terrorists what they are. Federal prosecutors said that Hasson had planned to kill Democrats and prominent journalists, and had done extensive research on a number of potential targets. In a statement issued to reporters after his plea, Hasson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s federal public defender said that Hasson had \u00e2\u0080\u009cstruggled with addiction to a prescription opioid painkiller,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but that the case against him had been \u00e2\u0080\u009cmischaracterized and sensationalized from the start.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not a domestic terrorism case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Liz Oyer said in the statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Hasson was never plotting a terrorist attack or any of the abhorrent acts that this prosecution has repeatedly speculated about but never actually charged. Mr. Hasson is a peaceful, loving family man. He devoted his life to serving his country. He and his wife have two grown children who have gone on to do the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Hasson never meant any harm to anyone. He deeply regrets the pain and embarrassment that he has caused his family and the U.S. Coast Guard, which he has proudly and honorably served for more than 20 years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe hope that, with Mr. Hasson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guilty plea, we can move past the rhetoric that has clouded the actual facts of this case.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hasson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife called him a \u00e2\u0080\u009cloving\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chonorable man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said that she hopes he comes home soon. Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas P. Wisdom, according to The Washington Post, told the court that the government planned to seek a possible life sentence when Hasson appears for his sentencing hearing on Jan. 31. But U.S. District Judge George J. Hazel said that Hasson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statutory maximum would be 31 years in prison, the Post reported. Maryland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top federal prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur, said in a statement that he looked \u00e2\u0080\u009cforward to the opportunity for the government to present additional evidence to the Court at sentencing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This story has been updated throughout with additional details and statements.",

      "author": "Hayley Miller",
      "content": " A bipartisan group of lawmakers echoed then-Vice President Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s push for anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine, including within the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office of the prosecutor general, according to a 2016 letter unearthed by CNN. In the letter, Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), co-chairs of the bipartisan Senate Ukraine Caucus, pressed Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s then-President Petro Poroshenko to take action on \u00e2\u0080\u009centrenched corruption\u00e2\u0080\u009d within his government. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe recognize \u00e2\u0080\u008ethat your governing coalition faces not only endemic corruption left from decades of mismanagement and cronyism, but also an illegal armed seizure of territory by Russia and its proxies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote in the letter. \u00e2\u0080\u009d[We] urge you to press ahead with urgent reforms to the Prosecutor General\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office and judiciary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The letter \u00e2\u0080\u0095 also signed by Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) \u00e2\u0080\u0095\u00c2\u00a0appears to undermine President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unsubstantiated claim that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cquid pro quo\u00e2\u0080\u009d when then-Vice President Biden withheld aid to Ukraine to push the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaders to fire its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. Trump claims Biden did so for the purpose of impeding an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company upon whose board Hunter Biden served.\u00c2\u00a0No evidence has been brought to light to suggest this. Biden boasted in 2018 about withholding $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to get them to oust Shokin, which Trump has claimed amounts to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cquid pro quo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But foreign policy experts, including a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, say Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions were an appropriate form of diplomatic pressure. Biden wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only person calling for Shokin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s removal from office. Members of Congress (as evidenced by the 2016 letter of support), European leaders and international organizations were all pushing for the notoriously corrupt prosecutor to be fired. Shokin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office had opened an investigation into Burisma, but it was dormant by the time Biden was working on anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0Ukrainian authorities have cleared Biden of any wrongdoing related to Shokin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firing. Neither Portman nor Kirk, who is no longer in office, immediately responded to HuffPost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requests for comment. Johnson wrote a letter with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) last week that, in part, called on Attorney General William Barr to investigate allegations that Biden called for Shokin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s removal to help his son. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe United States, the European Union, the I.M.F., and Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading reform figures were all pressing for Viktor Shokin to be removed from office because he was one of the biggest obstacles to fighting corruption in the entire country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates told HuffPost in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was a bipartisan goal in Congress as well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is unfortunate that Senator Johnson seems to have forgotten a time when he put the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s values over his own politics, but perhaps re-reading his well-articulated words whole-heartedly agreeing with Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s push to move the anti-corruption cause in Ukraine forward will help him on his journey back to intellectual consistency.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked for comment, a spokesperson for Johnson referred HuffPost to comments the senator made Wednesday during an interview with radio station WRRD. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson said while discussing some of the issues referenced in the letter he wrote with Grassley. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf something happened, the American people should know. If something didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen, the American people need to know so we can get this behind us. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about uncovering the truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obsession with Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Ukraine resulted in a whistleblower complaint filed in August by a U.S. intelligence official that alleges Trump repeatedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and may have withheld military aid as leverage. The complaint prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to announce the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump last week. Democrats say Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exchange with Zelensky amounts to an attempt to seek foreign interference in the 2020 election. Trump has claimed his call with Zelensky was \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that he withheld aid because he was annoyed that European allies were not paying enough. He praised Portman on Wednesday for backing up that explanation, declaring \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nobody more honorable\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0than him. The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for comment.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0095 The story behind why Democrats are moving forward with an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is simple. The president repeatedly pressured a foreign government to meddle in the 2020 U.S. election to help him win. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all there in the White House summary of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corroborated by the subsequent whistleblower complaint. And Trump keeps telling other countries to do it, too, on live television. The Republican strategy to respond to this is to create total confusion, namely by focusing on the arcane legal process of whistleblower law. Not only are their claims false, they are irrelevant to the facts of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abuse of power. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is out in front trying to lose people in the arcana of process and distract from what Trump did. He seized on a Wednesday New York Times report that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) got advance word of the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report and falsely claimed that Schiff orchestrated the complaint. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDemocrats have rigged this process from the start,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCarthy tweeted Wednesday, linking to the Times story. What the story actually said was that the whistleblower initially approached an Intelligence Committee staffer with a vague accusation. The staffer told the whistleblower to file a formal complaint through proper channels, per protocol, and then shared some of what the whistleblower said with Schiff, who never even knew the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity. The whistleblower did exactly what they were supposed to do. The intelligence community whistleblower process lists the congressional intelligence committees as a venue that a whistleblower may take their complaint or approach about how to proceed with a complaint. Republicans already know that whistleblowers are encouraged to go straight to committees with a complaint. The GOP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own page on the House Oversight and Reform website prominently features a link that literally says \u00e2\u0080\u009cblow the whistle\u00e2\u0080\u009d and offers a form for filing a complaint. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my experience, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than common for potential whistleblowers to contact the congressional intelligence committees directly in order to obtain guidance on the proper way to disclose wrongdoing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Irvin McCullough, an intelligence community whistleblower expert at the Government Accountability Project, told HuffPost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe process by which intelligence community employees and contractors can report wrongdoing is extremely complex and convoluted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou need someone that can help usher you along that process, whether that is a congressional intelligence committee staff or an experienced attorney.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Aides to Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Mark Warner (D-Va.), the ranking member, said on Wednesday that the whistleblower followed proper procedure by asking the House Intelligence Committee for guidance on how to file a complaint. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on top of the intelligence community inspector general and Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, both publicly stating that the whistleblower had done everything by the book. Another glaring hole in McCarthy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim is that the White House, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal attorney and Trump himself have all separately corroborated the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claims. Even before releasing the transcript, the president admitted that he brought up Joe Biden with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has repeatedly said he was right to do so. The president said his conversation with Zelensky was about corruption, too. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was largely the fact that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption [sic] already in the Ukraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said on Sept. 22. Additionally, the call summary revealed Trump tying talks about U.S. military aid to Ukraine to his request for investigations into his potential 2020 rival Biden and Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son Hunter. At the time of the call, Trump had suspended the provision of all aid to Ukraine. Zelensky was not aware of the U.S. suspension of aid until weeks after the call. Republicans are trying to paper over these facts with confusion, conspiracies and flat-out lies about how Democrats are proceeding in their investigation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is looking more & more like a deep state scheme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) tweeted Wednesday, invoking an insane conspiracy theory as an explanation for how Schiff got wind of a whistleblower complaint before it was filed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSchiff told the media on September 17: \u00e2\u0080\u0098We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He lied. The question is why?\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCarthy tweeted Wednesday, falsely claiming Schiff had spoken with the whistleblower when he had not. GOP senators, meanwhile, have been spreading misinformation to try to smear the credibility of the whistleblower. They have argued that in order to be considered a \u00e2\u0080\u009creal\u00e2\u0080\u009d whistleblower, you have to have firsthand information of a situation, which is false. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy definition, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a whistleblower because he was reporting hearsay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) incorrectly told reporters last week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that we are giving too much credence, or at least credit, to someone who does not meet the definition of a whistleblower.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a whistleblower because he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the room. He wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t on the phone call,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) said last week, also falsely. They were publicly corrected on Tuesday by one of their own colleagues, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a longtime advocate of whistleblower safeguards. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe distinctions being drawn between first- and second-hand knowledge aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t legal ones,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grassley. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not part of whistleblower protection law or any agency policy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Capitol Hill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most prominent advocate for whistleblowers\u00c2\u00a0says Democrats are mishandling a claim that someone interfered with President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taxes. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said this week that House Democrats are being \u00e2\u0080\u009cirresponsible\u00e2\u0080\u009d with their tax whistleblower \u00e2\u0080\u0095 because apparently, they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talked to the person. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps the most important practice when it comes to taking whistleblower complaints is making sure the whistleblower has agreed to have his or her complaint made public,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grassley,\u00c2\u00a0who has long championed whistleblower protection laws, said in a statement. The House Ways and Means Committee, which is suing for copies of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax returns,\u00c2\u00a0told a federal court in August that a federal employee had come to the committee with \u00e2\u0080\u009cevidence of possible misconduct\u00e2\u0080\u009d related to an audit of the president by the Internal Revenue Service. Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.) said this week that lawyers for the committee had not yet talked to the whistleblower.\u00c2\u00a0Neal told reporters in his Massachusetts district\u00c2\u00a0that the committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers \u00e2\u0080\u009care proceeding on the basis of trying to interview the individual.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Neal is fielding questions about the tax whistleblower as another government employee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint of wrongdoing by the Trump administration prompted House Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. That person, employed in the intelligence community, revealed that Trump pressured Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newly elected president to dig up dirt on 2020 election rival Joe Biden. Trump and his Republican supporters have attacked the intelligence whistleblower, falsely saying he has bogus information and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow the right process, but Grassley has defended him.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grassley said this week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should always work to respect whistleblowers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 requests for confidentiality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A spokesman for the Ways and Means Committee did not respond to questions about whether the committee had spoken to the tax whistleblower. Neal specifically said committee lawyers were trying to interview the person. Ways and Means sued for copies of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax returns in July after the administration defied a tax disclosure law and refused to hand over the documents in response to a formal request by the committee. Trump is the first president since the 1970s not to publicly disclose his tax returns, which contain details about money earned, taxes paid and charity given. Ways and Means members say they need to see the returns to make sure the presidential IRS audit, which it does every year, is done properly. Instead of bringing the tax whistleblower to wide attention, as House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has done, Neal offered in the tax case to privately present the material to the judge overseeing the committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawsuit. Pointing out that Grassley believes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong to even confirm the existence of a whistleblower without permission, a spokesman for the senator declined to say whether Grassley or the Senate Finance Committee, which Grassley chairs, also received the tax whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint. Senate Finance and House Ways and Means are the two main congressional committees that oversee taxes. Grassley himself told HuffPost last month that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know anything about the tax complaint. In his statement this week, the Iowa Republican said whistleblowers face \u00e2\u0080\u009ctremendous risk in making their complaints and they need to be reassured that their complaints will be handled seriously and with care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Update 9:30 p.m.:\u00c2\u00a0In an interview with The Washington Post published Thursday, the whistleblower revealed that he is a career official at the Internal Revenue Service and confirmed he filed a formal complaint and sent it to Neal, Grassley and the Treasury Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inspector general for tax administration. The whistleblower provided little new information about his complaint, but he lamented Republican attacks on the intelligence community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whistleblower. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am concerned also by the relative silence of people who should be repudiating these dangerous attacks in the strongest terms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.",

      "author": "Sara Boboltz",
      "content": " Ellen Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Commission, was moved once again to remind political candidates that asking for help from foreign governments is illegal, minutes after President Donald Trump publicly did just that. Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Thursday morning, the president urged the governments of Ukraine and China to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this thing on?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Weintraub wrote as she retweeted a message she first posted in June, this time adding a microphone emoji. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office. It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the chair\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original message read. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not a novel concept,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the original post continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cElectoral intervention from foreign governments has been considered unacceptable since the beginnings of our nation. Our Founding Fathers ... knew that when foreign governments seek to influence American politics, it is always to advance their own interests, not America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Weintraub was prompted to post that reminder in June after Trump told ABC News\u00c2\u00a0that he would consider accepting information on a political rival from a foreign national and dismissed the idea that such an act would constitute foreign interference in a U.S. election. The Mueller report, released earlier in the year, outlined Russian interference in the 2016 election along with 10 instances in which Trump may have sought to obstruct the special counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation. Now, the president has apparently become bolder than ever. Despite White House officials\u00e2\u0080\u0099 alleged efforts to cover up a July conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u00e2\u0080\u0095 in which the U.S. leader asked his Ukrainian counterpart to dig up dirt on Biden \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Trump solicited help from another foreign country before news cameras on Thursday. He did so even as the House is conducting an impeachment inquiry centered on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conversation with Zelensky, which came to light in a whistleblower complaint. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. The president is thought to view Biden as his chief rival in the 2020 election.",

      "author": "Sara Boboltz",
      "content": " During his Wednesday night interview with New York Times investigative reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, legendary journalist Bob Woodward asked whether disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexual misconduct was a form of \u00e2\u0080\u009cweird foreplay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He seemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cobsessed\u00e2\u0080\u009d with Weinstein at the expense of the producer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s female victims, journalist Kara Swisher noted on Twitter. He asked whether the women onstage believed Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who maintains she was sexually assaulted by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And he repeatedly interrupted them as they tried to give their answers. The audience was not happy. Some even left early. According to accounts from people who were there, Woodward elicited boos from the crowd assembled to hear Kantor and Twohey discuss \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Times reporters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 book about reporting on Weinstein. Their explosive reports, combined with related stories in The New Yorker, helped to propel the Me Too movement in late 2017. Weinstein is currently awaiting trial on felony sexual assault charges. Held at a Washington, D.C., synagogue, the event got off to a good start, Vox editor Kainaz Amaria said. Amaria noted that Woodward hailed Kantor and Twohey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work and asked some questions about their process. However, his interruptions while they attempted to answer questions \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a problem disproportionately faced by women speaking up in a group setting \u00e2\u0080\u0095 were reportedly distracting enough to prompt some audience members to yell, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet them finish!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The audience responded with applause, noted Robyn Swirling, founder of the anti-harassment group Works in Progress, in a detailed account of the evening as it went off the rails. Many of Woodward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questions also appeared to reflect a misunderstanding of current research around sexual violence. At one point, Woodward asked the reporters why Weinstein behaved the way he did, saying they\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009creally don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t address\u00e2\u0080\u009d the issue in the book. Twohey said they could \u00e2\u0080\u009cspend days or weeks or even months trying to get to the bottom of his psychology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but later Woodward accused her of \u00e2\u0080\u009cartfully dodging\u00e2\u0080\u009d his question. According to The Washington Post, the audience\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grumbles led to this exchange: Kantor: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you what we know. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that this story is an X-ray into power, and how power works.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Audience:\u00c2\u00a0[cheers] Woodward: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also about sex, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Audience: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Current research suggests that sexual violence is about power, and particularly power over women, rather than sexual desire \u00e2\u0080\u0095 which Kantor and Twohey had stated. Undeterred, though, Woodward came back to this line of questioning later on, asking again for the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take on \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat is driving\u00e2\u0080\u009d Weinstein.\u00c2\u00a0He wondered \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rosebud for Harvey\u00e2\u0080\u009d and asked whether the producer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abuse was \u00e2\u0080\u009csome kind of weird foreplay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Swisher was one of several attendees who lambasted the storied Watergate journalist on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInterruptive, not focused on the women who were victimized by Harvey Weinstein and weirdly obsessed with that creep, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a[n] exercise in how not to interview,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote, adding: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe crowd no like.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis questions and interjections made clear he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the first thing about rape culture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Swirling said in another tweet. All three reporters onstage addressed the feeling in the crowd afterward, but neither Kantor nor Twohey ventured criticism of Woodward, who shrugged it all off. In an email to The Washington Post, Woodward said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a longtime believer in the First Amendment, I am glad people got to express themselves. Jodi and Megan signed a copy of their book for me after the session, which I enjoyed very much, and said \u00e2\u0080\u0098thank you for the fabulous questions.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 So there may be a difference of opinion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a statement to several\u00c2\u00a0news outlets, Kantor and Twohey said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just starting our book tour, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re grateful to all the moderators \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Bob Woodward, Katie Couric, America Ferrera and many others \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who have agreed to join us onstage. We welcome all questions, from them and especially from the audience, because each one is an opportunity to relate the wrenching decisions that many of our sources had to make and grapple with MeToo as an example and test of social change in our time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet it seems that Woodward might not have been the best choice to include among those moderators. As Esther Wang noted at Jezebel, Woodward has a history of ignoring and diminishing charges of sexual harassment and assault \u00e2\u0080\u0095 having failed to address longstanding accusations that Richard Nixon physically abused his wife, Pat. Oddly enough, Woodward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparent decision to lean on a woefully outdated understanding of sexual abuse \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and how people talk about it \u00e2\u0080\u0095 is precisely the attitude Kantor and Twohey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book seeks to remedy.",

In an opinion column published on the Fox website late Wednesday, Napolitano assessed Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone call with Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25, 2019, in which Trump asked Zelensky \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo him a favor\u00e2\u0080\u009d immediately after mentioning U.S. aid to the country. Trump had ordered the aid withheld from Ukraine just days before the phone call, though it had already been appropriated by Congress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat conversation manifested both criminal and impeachable behavior,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Napolitano wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe criminal behavior to which Trump has admitted is much more grave than anything alleged or unearthed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and much of what Mueller revealed was impeachable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In addition to the call itself, Napolitano also took issue with Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal conduct since the allegations came to light via a whistleblower report in late September. Trump has accused the unidentified whistleblower of treason and amplified statements saying his impeachment would lead to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cCivil War-like fracture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allusions to violence are palpably dangerous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Napolitano. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will give cover to crazies who crave violence, as other intemperate words of his have done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis language is a dog whistle to the deranged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Napolitano is one of the few Fox personalities to consistently call out some of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more outrageous behavior. The fracture between Fox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s news and opinion sides spilled into the open last week when Tucker Carlson and host Shepard Smith traded barbs over Napolitano\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insights.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine told lawmakers Thursday that he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t personally involved in President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to have that country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaders investigate Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family and that he warned Ukrainians to steer clear of American politics. Kurt Volker, who has become a central figure in the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment inquiry, spent hours behind closed doors as lawmakers and staff pored through dozens of pages of text messages, photos and other correspondence during the interview, according to those familiar with the meeting. Volker appeared straightforward and forthcoming, and there was no question he did not answer, said one person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private session. The daylong appearance is the first in what is expected to be a series of interviews with officials inside and outside the State Department. House investigators want to understand if they played any role or have more information about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to press Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for damaging information about the former vice president, who is now a Democratic presidential contender and top Trump rival. Volker resigned on Friday after being asked to testify to Congress about the whistleblower complaint that describes how Trump, in a July 25 phone call , repeatedly prodded Zelenskiy for an investigation of Biden and his son Hunter, while his administration delayed the release of military aid to help Ukraine fight Russia-backed separatists. The complaint says Volker met in Kyiv with Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian political figures a day after the call, and he provided advice about how to \u00e2\u0080\u009cnavigate\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demands. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he was doing the best he could,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said retired senior U.S. diplomat Daniel Fried, who described the actions of his former colleague as trying to guide Ukrainians on \u00e2\u0080\u009chow to deal with President Trump under difficult circumstances.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Volker agreed to a voluntary interview with lawmakers and congressional staff, led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California, as Democrats dig deeper into the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handling of Ukraine. Volker, who also served as head of the John McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University, was said to be eager to appear and tell his side of the situation. The former envoy was in office as the administration was holding back $250 million for Ukraine at the time Trump was pressing Zelenskiy about the Bidens. Volker told the House investigators it was unusual for the U.S. to withhold aid to Ukraine, but said he was given no explanation for it, the person said. Republican lawmakers who took part in the interview with Volker downplayed what they heard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot one thing he has said comports with any of the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 impeachment narrative, not one thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. Republicans also argued that because Democrats have not yet voted in the House to open a formal impeachment inquiry, Democrats lack the authority to set certain rules for the hearing. Republicans are increasingly calling the impeachment proceedings into question as a way to sow doubt and put pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to force a vote that would put Democrats on record for an impeachment inquiry. Kevin McCarthy, the leader of House Republicans, said Pelosi should halt proceedings until then. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe American people deserve assurance that basic standards of due process will be present,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in a letter to the speaker. In response, Pelosi said in a letter to McCarthy that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is no requirement under the Constitution, under House Rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe hope you and other Republicans share our commitment to following the facts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As the impeachment inquiry focuses on Ukraine, Trump doubled down Thursday by publicly calling on China to also investigate Biden and his family, potentially setting off more alarms in Congress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said outside the White House. Trump said he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t directly asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to investigate, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertainly something we could start thinking about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in Ukraine has become deeply entangled in the impeachment inquiry as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed that he was also on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 call with Zelenskiy. The State Department said Volker has confirmed that he put a Zelenskiy adviser in contact with Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, at the Ukrainian adviser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request, and Giuliani has said he was in frequent contact with Volker. Volker told investigators Thursday he warned Giuliani not to rely on information coming from Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former top prosecutor, Yuri Lutsenko. The former prosecutor general reportedly had been in contact with Giuliani, the person said. Giuliani has played a central role in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to launch a Ukrainian corruption probe into the Bidens that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now part of the impeachment inquiry. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Although the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son. Separately, The Associated Press reported on Wednesday that Volker met last year with a top official from the same Ukrainian energy firm that paid Hunter Biden to serve on its board. The meeting occurred even as Giuliani pressed Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government to investigate the company and the Bidens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 involvement with it. Pompeo accused the congressional investigators of trying to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbully\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cintimidate\u00e2\u0080\u009d State Department officials with subpoenas for documents and testimony, suggesting he would seek to prevent them from providing information. But the committee managed to schedule the deposition with Volker, as well as one next week with Marie Yovanovitch, who was U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until she was removed from the post last spring. ___ Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Alan Fram contributed to this report.",

      "content": " Public opinion in the U.S. has shifted significantly in favor of impeachment, according to a new wave of national polling. Polls from CNN/SSRS, Monmouth, Quinnipiac, Reuters/Ipsos, Economist/YouGov, as well as new HuffPost/YouGov polling, together paint a clear picture of growing support for impeachment in the wake of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (D-Calif.) announcement that she backs an \u00e2\u0080\u009cofficial impeachment inquiry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still plenty of variation in the exact levels of support that different pollsters find for impeachment, in part because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a lot of variation in exactly what questions those pollsters are asking. But as the chart below demonstrates, the direction in which opinion has moved is both consistent and apparent. For the first time, polls also generally find support for impeachment tying or modestly outstripping opposition. FiveThirtyEight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment tracker, which aggregates the polling from a number of outlets, puts support for impeachment at about 47%, with opposition at about 45%. At the beginning of September, average support stood at about 39%, with opposition near 53%. The polling doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer a total consensus about exactly who are changing their minds on impeachment. A number of surveys, including initial HuffPost/YouGov polling, found that the movement was due mostly to Democrats, who followed their party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaders in coalescing around support for an inquiry. Others, however, also found rising support among independents or even Republicans. Democratic backing for impeachment is increasingly verging on the universal, with most polls finding three-quarters or more in support. In the most recent Quinnipiac survey, 90% of Democratic voters said Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould be impeached and removed from office,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and 95% favored the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 impeachment inquiry. If support for impeachment is to continue to grow much further, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also need to make inroads beyond just the party \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a path that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complicated by the already-polarized reactions\u00c2\u00a0to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conversation with the leader of Ukraine. This week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0new HuffPost/YouGov poll, the second of our surveys conducted entirely in the wake of Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement, finds less evidence that the initial spike in support for impeachment has led to continuing momentum. It finds support for impeachment, if anything, dipping from its initial spike last week, although the change is within the poll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s margin of error. Americans support impeachment 44% to 40% in the latest poll, compared to the 47%-to-39% margin a week prior. A bigger change within the last week is that more Americans have started paying attention to the story. About half the public now says they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard a lot about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call to the Ukrainian president, up from 37% last week. The GOP, meanwhile, is coalescing around the defense that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t out of the ordinary. In last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poll, 43% of Republicans said they thought most U.S. politicians would be willing to ask a foreign government to investigate a political opponent, as the president has; in the most recent survey, that number rose to 63%. Numbers among Democrats and independents for that question barely budged. Use this link to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups. The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 30-Oct. 1 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nationally representative opinion polling. More details on the polls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 methodology are available here. Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some but not all potential survey errors. YouGov\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.",

      "content": " LANGHORNE, Pa. \u00e2\u0080\u0095 After the sun went down Monday, Raina Shoemaker dropped four slices of cold pizza onto the grill grate and pushed them over the flame with a stick. When they were warm, she doled out the slices to her General Motors co-workers on makeshift plates fashioned from a torn pizza box. Shoemaker, a GM warehouse worker, has been on strike for more than two weeks, much of that time spent in the glow of the fire outside the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parts distribution center here northeast of Philadelphia. The GM employees, all members of the United Auto Workers union, were each assigned to a six-hour picket shift at the warehouse so that the protest could continue around the clock. While Shoemaker wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t officially on duty this particular night, there was nowhere else she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather have been. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are going to win this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Shoemaker, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worked at the warehouse for four years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care what it takes. If I have to frigging support everyone, I will do it. Write that down. We are winning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The first prolonged U.S. auto strike in more than two decades entered its 17th day on Thursday, long enough to become dangerous for both sides. GM continues to lose money due to stalled production \u00e2\u0080\u0095 one estimate puts the cost at $1 billion so far \u00e2\u0080\u0095 while workers are starting to feel the squeeze of missed paydays. The UAW started distributing strike pay to members on Monday, but $250 per week only goes so far in covering mortgages, groceries and truck payments. Those who could began saving months ago when a strike seemed possible, but many of the newer workers who are on a lower pay scale couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to put money away. Every additional day the work stoppage lasts, the more those workers will be tested. Many, if not most, have never experienced a strike before. The warehouse in Langhorne is a case study in how union members are holding it together now that GM has dug in and the burst of initial headlines has passed. The facility, which sends parts out to GM dealers along the East Coast, employs about 80 union members \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a tiny fraction of the nearly 50,000 on strike around the country. But they drew hundreds of supporters to a rally at the picket line over the weekend, a show of solidarity that stunned some strikers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis Has Brought Us Closer\u00e2\u0080\u009d Food arrives at the Langhorne picket site every day \u00e2\u0080\u0095 bags of hoagies and boxes of doughnuts \u00e2\u0080\u0095 so much that the strikers can barely get through it all. The pizza came courtesy of some sympathetic steelworkers. Local members of the Democratic Socialists of America dropped off a load of wood to keep the fire burning. As Shoemaker reheated the pizza, a worker from a nearby Boeing plant showed up with another bundle of wood. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been stopping by ever since the strike started. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe company had no idea how much support we would get,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Charlie Correll, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 66 and has\u00c2\u00a0worked\u00c2\u00a048 years with GM. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd honestly, neither did we.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Employees who passed by one another on shift changes for years with little more than a hi and bye, not even knowing names, are now camped out together, planning events and learning about each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s families. Shoemaker said she decided to give her strike payment check to a co-worker who needs it more than she does. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGM totally miscalculated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dave Greenhalgh, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worked at GM facilities since the early 1980s. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis has brought us much closer. There were people who were on different shifts and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know each other. Now they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out here on the picket lines together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Workers went on strike to look out for one another, Greenhalgh said, and the divisions between workers inside GM have made for one of the most contentious issues in the negotiations. Although the contract talks are tight-lipped, GM probably wants to expand its use of temporary employees, a category the union believes has been exploited. Workers at the Langhorne facility say the use of temps has not been a major issue there, since most temps tend to get hired on within a few months. But they feel the problem is pervasive at assembly plants, where workers can remain \u00e2\u0080\u009ctemporary\u00e2\u0080\u009d for two years or more and sometimes for multiple stints before becoming full-time employees. Then there is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cin progression\u00e2\u0080\u009d system. In 2007, the UAW agreed to put newer hires on a lower pay scale as the company veered toward bankruptcy. The sacrifice helped keep GM alive, but it created rifts within plants and undermined a central tenet of unionism: equal pay for equal work. The union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2015 contract ultimately created a pathway for newer workers to reach the earning levels of legacy employees \u00e2\u0080\u0095 roughly $30 per hour \u00e2\u0080\u0095 but only after they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve put in eight years. They start around $17 per hour. Workers at the Langhorne facility said their system is even more complicated. According to Shoemaker and others, employees who came on after the 2015 contract top out closer to $24, because they work in distribution. They refer to one another as first-tier, second-tier and even third-tier, depending on when they started working for GM. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Correll, a legacy employee because of his long tenure. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making over $10 billion a year [in profits]. Look at what the executives make. You want to cut costs? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your start.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey Wanted Animosity\u00e2\u0080\u009d UAW members have made cutting down the amount of time it takes to reach the top rate a priority, as well as limiting the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of temps \u00e2\u0080\u0095 both of which could go a long way toward healing divisions between tiers. Members worry that the persistence of a caste system could erode solidarity within the union over time, as different factions have less reason to support one another. After all, why would a newer hire look out for a legacy employee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interests if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paid less for doing the same job? Pat Sippos believes that was the idea all along. He is 60 and has spent 35 years with GM. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey wanted animosity down the road,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sippos said, standing by the bonfire. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey wanted us to be fighting each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sippos has made the top rate for years and earned a pension, for which newer hires aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eligible. But he supports the strike for reasons both philosophical and personal: His son is trying to build a career at the warehouse. Sippos is not worried about his own finances during the strike \u00e2\u0080\u0095 he can tap into his 401(k) without penalty at his age \u00e2\u0080\u0095 but he knows younger workers wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the same cushion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still here and why I believe in the strike,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnything that affects union brothers and sisters affects me \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way people need to look at it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Langhorne facility receives shipments of parts by truck, stocks them in the warehouse, and sends them back out to dealers. The operation relies on outside drivers to distribute the parts. The workers say that UPS drivers, who are Teamsters members, appear to have honored the picket line, cutting down how many shipments can leave the warehouse. FedEx drivers, they say,\u00c2\u00a0have continued to come and go. The workers have maintained two pickets \u00e2\u0080\u0095 one at the quiet employee entrance, where Shoemaker was reheating pizza, and another at the busier truck entrance on the other side. There have been rumors of scabs from New York working inside, but no one on the picket line knows for sure. Cars with dealer plates have been pulling in and out of the facility, likely GM dealers coming to pick up the parts that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t getting to them. Whatever work is getting done inside probably comes at the hands of very tired managers. Every hour or so on a recent evening, a supervisor would pull out of the employee entrance and give the picketers a friendly honk and wordless wave before heading home. They would want the strike to end almost as much as their employees. Like any company in the middle of a major work stoppage, GM is weighing the costs of lost production now against the future labor costs they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re resisting at the table. The company also is wondering when rank-and-file workers might start to waver as their bills mount. If the strike persists and workers feel increasingly squeezed, they may become more likely to accept a subpar deal just to get back to work. The workers also worry about their health coverage. GM initially moved to cut off health insurance shortly after the strike started, which would force the union to dip into its strike fund to cover COBRA costs. After a round of bad press, the company reversed itself and said coverage would continue uninterrupted. But GM would not commit to maintaining it if the strike drags on. Sippos has bladder cancer and a round of chemotherapy scheduled next week. He said if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any ambiguity regarding his health insurance, he would rather skip the chemo round than be handed a huge bill. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Few Weeks Of Sacrifice\u00e2\u0080\u009d While a lot of news coverage has faded, many workers believe community support will become even more important as the strike wears on. The local UAW union is made up entirely of GM employees from the warehouse, and it no longer has its own union hall, instead renting a space for meetings. Mindy Isser, a Philadelphia-based labor organizer, has been making the trip to Langhorne nearly every day after work, often with friends in tow, to boost morale. She helped raise about $3,000 online to put toward food and strike supplies. She and a friend recently took about a third of that money to BJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wholesale Club to buy food for cash-strapped GM employees. Thirteen workers signed up their families to receive bags of groceries. The majority of them were second-tier employees. On a recent morning, three strikers held the picket at the truck entrance, in a show of the workforce\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diversity: Kathy Henry, who is white; Jamel Johnson, who is African-American; and Joel Inocencio, a Filipino immigrant. They put down their strike signs briefly to wolf down some egg-and-cheese sandwiches a supporter had just dropped off. They waved whenever a car driving by gave a honk. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m on the downside,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Henry, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worked for GM for 35 years. She gestured to Johnson and Inocencio: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotta stand out here on the concrete so these guys can have some job stability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Their last paycheck had come a week and a half earlier, and now it was the first of the month \u00e2\u0080\u0095 \u00e2\u0080\u009cbill time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Inocencio put it. He was starting to feel pinched financially. He planned on calling his mortgage lender later in the day to explain the strike and ask for leniency. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut all of this \u00e2\u0080\u0095 it pays off, just hanging in there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a few weeks of sacrifice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A manager pulled up in her SUV and rolled down her window. Henry asked her if she missed them inside. The manager made a little heart with her hands. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you miss us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the manager asked in return. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course we do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson said. The manager told them to make sure they were wearing high-visibility vests at night and to stock up on firewood; colder weather is expected to move in within a few days. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut hopefully this will all be over by then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, before driving away.",

      "content": " Vice President Mike Pence\u00c2\u00a0gave his full-throated support to Donald Trump on Thursday after the president openly encouraged foreign leaders to dig up dirt on his potential 2020 opponent\u00c2\u00a0Joe Biden. Asked whether he thought it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cappropriate\u00e2\u0080\u009d that Trump\u00c2\u00a0suggested both China\u00c2\u00a0and Ukraine should investigate the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden, Pence told reporters that he and Trump were elected to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdrain the swamp.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position as vice president during the last administration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told reporters at the roundtable event with Latino business leaders in Scottsdale, Arizona. Trump is now facing an impeachment inquiry stemming from a\u00c2\u00a0whistleblower complaint from within the intelligence community\u00c2\u00a0alleging that Trump repeatedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family while also withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid for the war-torn country.\u00c2\u00a0The complaint also claims that White House officials attempted to cover up the misconduct. After the White House released a summary the July 25 phone call at the center of the complaint and congressional investigators released a redacted version of the complaint, Trump began openly calling on foreign leaders to investigate the Biden family over Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business dealings while his father was vice president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump told reporters at the White House earlier Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump also said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) launched a formal impeachment probe into the growing scandal after the whistleblower complaint pointed to clear evidence of Trump soliciting foreign interference in the election. Pence has been drawn into the scandal after The Washington Post reported Wednesday that the vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top aide was on the phone call in which Trump pushed Zelensky to look into the Bidens. According to the Post, Pence would have had a copy of the transcript of the call before he met with Zelensky in September. However, an official who spoke to the paper said Pence wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t aware of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to encourage an investigation. Speaking at the roundtable on Thursday, Pence said Trump had tasked him with meeting with Zelensky to discuss a \u00e2\u0080\u009clack of European support\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ccorruption.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He continued to defend Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with Zelensky, insisting that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe president was raising issues that were appropriate and of genuine interest to the American people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calls for a Biden investigation stem from Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position as a board member of a Ukrainian gas company. The president has been pushing the debunked theory that then-Vice President Joe Biden called for the removal of a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor to impede an investigation into the company. At the time, a bipartisan group of lawmakers had also pushed for anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, as CNN reported.\u00c2\u00a0Ukrainian authorities later cleared Hunter Biden of any wrongdoing.",

      "subtitle": "The Justice Department is supposed to tell the Federal Election Commission about any campaign finance legal matters it reviews. Did it?",
      "author": "Paul Blumenthal",
      "content": " Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) wants to know whether the Department of Justice informed the Federal Election Commission when it reviewed a referral based on a whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint that President Donald Trump may have violated campaign finance laws by pressuring Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to open investigations into his political rivals. In a letter to the three FEC commissioners sent Wednesday, Klobuchar, a presidential candidate, asked whether the Department of Justice violated a 42-year-old agreement to share information about campaign finance-related legal matters with the FEC after it determined that Trump had not broken the law. The Justice Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to inform the FEC is potentially a \u00e2\u0080\u009cthird cover-up\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abuse of power after he pressured Zelensky on July 25 to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate, Georgetown Law School professors Neal Katyal and Joshua Geltzer argued in a New York Times op-ed on Wednesday. The first two cover-ups, they argue, were the efforts to hide a record of the phone conversation on a code-word classified server and then the refusal of the acting director of national intelligence to send the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint to\u00c2\u00a0congressional intelligence committees as required by law. Klobuchar, as the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal elections, wants to know whether the Justice Department ever informed the FEC that it had reviewed a campaign finance legal matter regarding the president and declined to prosecute it and whether the FEC agreed with the DOJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s determination that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions did not violate the law. The agreement between the Justice Department and the FEC to share information about campaign finance legal matters dates to 1978. A memo outlining it states that DOJ must inform the FEC of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cprobable violation\u00e2\u0080\u009d or if it determines a complaint \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes not amount to a significant and substantial knowing and willful violation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In either of these cases, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe department will refer the matter to the commission as promptly as possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the past, the Justice Department has informed the FEC at the end of a prosecution or once a decision was made to not bring charges. The FEC still considers this agreement to be active. The public might have learned earlier about the complaint and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alleged abuse of power had the Justice Department disclosed its findings to the FEC after it declined to prosecute. Additionally, the FEC could investigate the matter itself and has the ability to issue fines for civil violations of campaign finance law. The Justice Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finding absolving the president of wrongdoing was revealed only after House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) pressed the Trump administration to disclose a whistleblower complaint that it was withholding from his committee. The complaint said that Trump had used his office to pressure the Ukrainian president in the July 25 call to investigate Biden. The acting director of national intelligence referred the allegation that Trump solicited a thing of value from a foreign government to the Justice Department after the intelligence community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inspector general alerted him to it in the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint. DOJ dismissed this charge against the president because it could not put a value on a foreign government opening an investigation into Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s domestic political rival. Klobuchar has asked the committee to respond by Oct. 9.",

      "author": "Sarah Ruiz-Grossman",
      "content": " Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who is running for president, introduced a bill Thursday that would invest billions of more dollars in affordable housing and other initiatives to prevent homelessness. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cEnding Homelessness Act,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which was co-sponsored by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), would give an additional $13.27 billion over five years to create an estimated 400,000 affordable housing units. The funds would go to supportive housing, including homeless shelters and transitional housing, as well as housing vouchers for low-income families and local outreach services to homeless residents. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.)\u00c2\u00a0introduced a similar bill in the House in March, which\u00c2\u00a0passed in committee and is expected to go to the House floor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToo many people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a safe place to call home. We must act quickly to tackle our country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homelessness crisis head on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harris said in a news release. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe women and men who woke up this morning on a bench or under an overpass cannot afford to wait.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The lack of affordable housing is a nationwide crisis, and California has one of the highest rates of homelessness. On any given day in January 2018, more than 500,000 people were homeless in the U.S., according to a federal report. Nearly a quarter of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homeless residents live in California. In the past two years, homelessness has spiked in Los Angeles, parts of which Waters represents, and the San Francisco Bay Area, where Harris is from and had served as district attorney. We have a homelessness crisis in America\u00e2\u0080\u0094and we must act quickly to tackle it head on.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m working with @RepMaxineWaters to introduce the Ending Homelessness Act to direct $9.5 billion to eliminate chronic homelessness in America. https://t.co/mb9SL6UPT7 President Donald Trump went on a tear last month about homelessness in California, notably complaining about how people living in tents were ruining the \u00e2\u0080\u009cprestige\u00e2\u0080\u009d of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Some of Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fellow 2020 contenders have also zeroed in on homelessness in recent weeks, with former Housing Secretary Juli\u00c3\u00a1n Castro and former Congressman Beto O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke both visiting California last month to speak with people in homeless encampments. The funds for Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and Waters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 legislation would be appropriated from mandatory emergency relief funding, according to a news release \u00e2\u0080\u0095 but Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 team said it was still to be determined, namely through processes in the Senate committee, exactly where the funds would be drawn from. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the richest country in the world, it is simply unacceptable that we have people living in the streets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Waters said in a news release.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u00e2\u0080\u0095 in a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping in June, sources familiar with the phone cal told CNN on Thursday. The report comes hours after Trump suggested, while speaking to reporters, that China investigate Biden, appearing to openly ask another foreign government to influence an American election despite Congress investigating Trump for doing the same thing with Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president. According to CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report on the June 18 call, Trump brought up the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical prospects\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Biden and Warren, the latter of who had recently started rising in the polls. In that same call, he promised not to speak out on the ongoing Hong Kong protests as China and the U.S. negotiate a trade deal. A record of the call was moved to a highly secure server, CNN reported. The alleged conversation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and how it was archived \u00e2\u0080\u0094 bears significant similarity to a phone call Trump had around the same time with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump pressed the leader to investigate Biden while also reminding him that the U.S. had provided Ukraine with a lot of foreign aid. That interaction prompted a whistleblower to raise concerns about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior, which has since sparked a formal House impeachment inquiry, which Trump has repeatedly denounced as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwitch hunt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The White House did not immediately return HuffPost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for comment, but officials told the press in June that the call with Xi involved discussion of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe importance of leveling the playing field for U.S. farmers, workers, and businesses through a fair and reciprocal economic relationship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

Trump on Thursday told reporters he had heard \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery bad things\u00e2\u0080\u009d about Yovanovitch, a respected foreign service official, prior to her removal.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if I recalled her or somebody recalled her but I heard very, very bad things about her for a long period of time. Not good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Yovanovitch was also the subject of an attempted smear campaign earlier this year by Trump allies who sent a packet of documents with misinformation about her to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Politico reported\u00c2\u00a0earlier this week. Debunked conspiracy theories about Hunter Biden also were included in those documents, according to the Politico story. Prior to Yovanovitch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recall, conservative media outlets and the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eldest son,\u00c2\u00a0Donald Trump Jr.,\u00c2\u00a0accused\u00c2\u00a0her of being part of an alleged Ukrainian attempt to support Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 presidential campaign. Trump also made threatening comments about Yovanovitch during his\u00c2\u00a0July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to go through some things\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the aftermath of her removal from the envoy post, Trump said,\u00c2\u00a0according to a White House\u00c2\u00a0summary of the conversation released last week. Democrats now view Yovanovitch as potentially a key witness in the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment inquiry into Trump. The false documents sent out about her \u00e2\u0080\u009cprovide further evidence of a concerted, external effort to conduct a disinformation campaign against a career U.S ambassador, who has been the subject of baseless attacks, including by the president himself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) said in a statement on Tuesday. According to the second Thursday report, this one in The New York Times, two top U.S. diplomats drafted a statement for Zelensky that would have publicly committed him to carry out Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for an investigation that would have involved the Bidens. Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, the envoy to Ukraine, prepared the statement, the Times said, citing\u00c2\u00a0three people who were briefed on the matter.\u00c2\u00a0The alleged statement, according to the newspaper, would have served the purpose of pushing Ukraine leaders beyond their private pledges to launch the investigation, which would have focused on the energy company Burisma on whose board Hunter Biden served. Volker resigned from his post last week after he was implicated in the published whistleblower complaint which raised concerns that the pressure being applied on Ukraine by Trump for an investigation that included Joe Biden \u00e2\u0080\u0095 the potential 2020 Democratic presidential nominee \u00e2\u0080\u0095 represented an effort to have foreign officials meddle in the U.S. election. The complaint spurred the opening of the impeachment inquiry by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). In the complaint, the whistleblower said that both Volker and Sondland spoke with Giuliani in an attempt to \u00e2\u0080\u009dcontain the damage\u00e2\u0080\u00b3 done by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requests to Ukraine. Volker testified before three House committees on Thursday as part of the impeachment inquiry.",

      "content": " Rick Perry is expected to resign by the end of the year as secretary of the Department of Energy,\u00c2\u00a0Politico\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0The Washington Post reported Thursday. Perry said earlier this week that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d cooperate with lawmakers investigating an explosive whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communications in July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Perry has met with Zelensky at least three times, according to CNN. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile the Beltway media has breathlessly reported on rumors of Secretary Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure for months, he is still the Secretary of Energy and a proud member of President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cabinet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Energy Department spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes said in a statement to HuffPost on Friday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne day the media will be right. Today is not that day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Perry, who Politico reported will leave by end of November, had reportedly been planning an exit since mid-April, when several sources with knowledge of his plans told Bloomberg\u00c2\u00a0that the former Texas governor was \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinalizing the terms and timing of his departure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During his unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2012, Perry had vowed to eliminate the Department of Energy\u00c2\u00a0(despite infamously forgetting the department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name and uttering \u00e2\u0080\u009coops\u00e2\u0080\u009d during a November 2011 debate). Roughly five years later, he was Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pick for energy secretary. Perry, an Air Force veteran and former \u00e2\u0080\u009cDancing With the Stars\u00e2\u0080\u009d contestant, was initially unclear on what the department he was tasked with leading actually did.\u00c2\u00a0According to a New York Times report in January 2017, Perry believed his new job would entail championing the U.S. oil and gas industry, as he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d done during his 14 years as the governor of Texas. He quickly learned the role\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary responsibilities would involve overseeing nuclear weapons and nuclear waste, with very little pertaining to either fossil fuels or renewable energy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you asked him on that first day he said yes, he would have said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I want to be an advocate for energy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who advised Perry during his 2016 presidential campaign, told the Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you asked him now, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m serious about the challenges facing the nuclear complex.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a learning curve.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Unlike many other Cabinet members, Perry reportedly enjoyed amicable relations with Trump during his tenure as energy secretary. The president named Perry as\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cdesignated survivor\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0for the 2019 State of the Union address \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a custom in which one Cabinet member hides in an undisclosed location during the address in case a catastrophe occurs in the House chamber. Trump also weighed Perry as a possible head for the Department of Veterans Affairs before ousting its secretary,\u00c2\u00a0David Shulkin, last year. Perry reportedly declined a request from Trump to take over as Department of Homeland Security secretary before Kirstjen Nielsen resigned earlier in April\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf. Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure is the latest major shake-up in the Trump administration and follows Nielsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resignation, as well as the departures of national security adviser John Bolton,\u00c2\u00a0Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats,\u00c2\u00a0Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta,\u00c2\u00a0Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and chief of staff John Kelly. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated incorrectly that Nielsen resigned this month. She resigned in April.",

A call to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to push him into similar action that would affect a U.S. presidential election is the focus of an impeachment inquiry. This is insane.  Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gotta go. https://t.co/3nSgVPNSZ3 Trump also told reporters Thursday that China should investigate Biden. Conway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cinsane\u00e2\u0080\u009d label for what has been transpiring with Trump followed a treatise Thursday in The Atlantic that Trump is unfit for office because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an extreme \u00e2\u0080\u009cnarcissist\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0who puts himself ahead of the nation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be a mental health professional to see something\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seriously off with Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Conway wrote. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only getting worse under the stress of a stumbling economy and an impeachment investigation, he warned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo president in recent memory \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and likely no president ever \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has prompted more discussion about his mental stability and connection with reality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Conway wrote. He recounted several troubling reports since Trump took office, including former White House chief of staff John Kelly allegedly calling Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009cunhinged\u00e2\u0080\u009d and an anonymous White House official writing of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstability\u00e2\u0080\u009d in The New York Times. The president is \u00e2\u0080\u009cvolatile and erratic\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and \u00e2\u0080\u009cincapable of consistently telling the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d George Conway wrote. He quoted Times columnist Megan McArdle: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not normal. And I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that as in, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Trump is violating the shibboleths of the Washington establishment.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I mean that as in, \u00e2\u0080\u0098This is not normal for a functioning adult.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d A president should act as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfiduciary\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the nation, who pursues the \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099public interest in good faith republican fashion rather than pursuing his self-interest,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Conway noted, quoting from a recent Harvard Review article. But Trump acts instead like an extreme \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if not \u00e2\u0080\u009cpathological\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 narcissist who is convinced he is an exceptional human being and an expert on everything, despite evidence to the contrary, lacks empathy, and craves being the constant focus of admiration, Conway argued.\u00c2\u00a0The \u00e2\u0080\u009cfundamental life goal\u00e2\u0080\u009d of an extreme narcissist \u00e2\u0080\u009cis to promote the greatness of the self, for all to see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d psychologist Dan McAdams has written in The Atlantic, Conway noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSimply put, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ingrained and extreme behavioral characteristics make it impossible for him to carry out the duties of the presidency in the way the Constitution requires,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Conway argued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would take entire books to catalog all of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavioral abnormalities and try to explain them .... But when you line up what the Framers expected of a president with all that we know about Donald Trump, his unfitness becomes obvious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Conway wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo act as a fiduciary requires you to put someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interests above your own, and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personality makes it impossible for him to do that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Conway concluded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor Trump, Trump always comes first. He places his interests over everyone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including those of the nation whose laws he swore to faithfully execute. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not consistent with the duties of the president.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The answer to the Trump problem, Conway concluded, is impeachment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Congress does its job and presents the evidence, those who are in denial\u00e2\u0080\u009d about Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009cwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to ignore the problem any longer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot only because of the evidence itself, but because Donald Trump will respond in pathological ways \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and in doing so, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll prove the points against him in ways almost no one will be able to ignore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read Conway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s piece in The Atlantic here.

      "author": "Nick Visser",
      "content": " Newly released text messages sent by senior Trump administration officials appear to show clear instances of the White House brazenly pressuring Ukraine for political favors in exchange for cooperation from the U.S. government. The texts were released late Thursday by the chairs of three House committees, who wrote in a letter to colleagues that they had \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrave concerns\u00e2\u0080\u009d after speaking with State Department officials as part of the chamber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfolding impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 call with the leader of Ukraine. The three chairs wrote that the shocking texts were \u00e2\u0080\u009conly a subset of the full body of materials\u00e2\u0080\u009d that had been obtained, the entirety of which they planned to release in the coming days. (Read the full document at the bottom of this article.) The text message were largely sent by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt Volker, who was until last month the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s special envoy to Ukraine, to Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In one instance that appears to be an overt quid pro quo, Volker texted Yermak just hours before the two presidents were set to speak. In the message, Volker said the White House would work to \u00e2\u0080\u009cnail down the date for [a] visit to Washington\u00e2\u0080\u009d but only on the assumption that \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Z convinces trump he will investigate/\u00e2\u0080\u0098get to the bottom of what happened\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in 2016.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 call with Zelensky has become the flashpoint for a Democratic impeachment inquiry after a reconstruction of the call showed multiple instances of Trump pressuring his counterpart to investigate a prime political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. In the texts, Yermak later wrote that the call\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cwent well\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that Trump and Zelensky had agreed on a visit to the U.S. Later in August, however, Yermak pressed Volker to nail down the date, saying that once it was locked in, Ukrainian officials would outline their \u00e2\u0080\u009cvision for the reboot of US-Ukraine relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, for five years, ending in early 2019. Yermak also texted Volker at the end of August expressing concern about a report Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine. Trump canceled a planned visit to Poland to meet Zelensky a day later. The text messages also show concern among some Trump administration officials. In multiple instances, Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, expressed worry that the White House was withholding military aid until any investigations into Biden were launched. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Taylor asked Sondland on Sept. 1. Sondland later replied \u00e2\u0080\u009ccall me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear what the pair discussed. But the issue came up again a week later: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Taylor texted Sondland on Sept. 9, saying diplomacy had moved into his \u00e2\u0080\u009cnightmare scenario.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sondland later rejects that characterization, saying Trump had \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeen crystal clear no quid pro quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of any kind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The texts were attached to a letter condemning Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to minimize his call with Ukraine. It was signed by Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff (Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee; Eliot Engel (N.Y.), chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; and Elijah Cummings (Md.), who chairs the House Oversight and Reform Committee. The lawmakers expressed worry about the White House effort to delegitimize the impeachment inquiry, saying the Trump administration was \u00e2\u0080\u009cengaging in a campaign of misinformation and misdirection in an attempt to normalize the act of soliciting foreign powers to interfere in our election.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump has vehemently rejected claims that he did anything improper, referring to the inquiry as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoup.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Thursday, the president publicly urged China to investigate the Bidens just moments after saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009cif they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do what we want, we have tremendous power.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the letter, the chairmen urged their colleagues to reject such claims, calling them \u00e2\u0080\u009cunethical, unpatriotic and wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe hope every Member of the House will join us in condemning in the strongest terms the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now open defiance of our core values as American citizens to guard against foreign interference in our democratic process,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote.

Perdue said Tuesday at the World Dairy Expo in Madison that he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t holding out much hope for the survival of family dairy operations with fewer than 100 cows. Farmers are bearing the brunt of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade war, and dairy exports to China fell 54% in the first half of this year.\u00c2\u00a0Wisconsin, which boasts on its license plates that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dairyland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d has lost 551 dairy farms so far this year after losing 638 in 2018 and 465 in 2017, according to the state. Nearly 3,000 U.S. dairy farms folded in the nation last year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a decline of about 6.5%, according to U.S. figures. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow what we see, obviously, is economies of scale having happened in America \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0big get bigger and small go out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Perdue said flatly.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think in America we, for any small business, have a guaranteed income or a guaranteed probability of survival.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evers complained to journalists Wednesday that Perdue \u00e2\u0080\u009cput the pox on\u00c2\u00a0small farming in the state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Milwaukee Journal reported. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre they struggling? Absolutely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Evers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I think at the end of the day we need to get behind them rather than saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0099Ah maybe you should go larger.\u00e2\u0080\u00b2 I, frankly, resent that the Department of Agriculture secretary from the federal government came in and kind of lambasted them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Darin Von Ruden, president of the Wisconsin Farmers Union who runs a 50-cow organic farm, complained to reporters that larger farms are \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot a good way to go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Associated Press reported. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo we want one corporation to own all the food\u00c2\u00a0in our country?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Von Ruden asked. An organization of women in agriculture, Women Involved in Farm Economics,\u00c2\u00a0 demanded that Perdue be fired and replaced with someone who supports smaller farm and ranch operations, and not Big Ag corporations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith fewer and fewer places to sell our products and no support from our government to stop concentration in the agriculture market, farmers and ranchers are squeezed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president, Diane McDonald, told Nebraska\u00e2\u0080\u0099s McCook Gazette. Cattle ranchers at a rally in Omaha on Wednesday, coordinated by the Organization for Competitive Markets, also called for Perdue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firing, accusing him of promoting corporate meatpackers at the expense of American independent cattle ranchers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing natural or inevitable about consolidation in agriculture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Claire Kelloway, a researcher at Open Markets Institute, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFarmers are pushed to get big or get out because of policies that enable predatory monopolies to strip wealth from farmers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Perdue has the ability to \u00e2\u0080\u009cenact policies that would crack down on the abusive agriculture monopolies that are pushing out small producers and independent family farms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Calloway added. Trump declared in July during a visit to Wisconsin \u00e2\u0080\u0094 much to the surprise of farmers the president calls \u00e2\u0080\u009chis patriots\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that \u00e2\u0080\u009csome of the farmers are doing really well.\u00c2\u00a0 We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re over the hump.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rural areas were crucial to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election in 2016.

      "content": " A stunt involving an alleged supporter of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) ranting about eating babies to stop climate change was a hoax orchestrated by a right-wing group. LaRouche PAC, which supports President Donald Trump and believes, among other falsehoods, that climate change is a hoax, took credit for the bizarre stunt on Twitter. Video of the incident circulated Thursday night, after a woman wearing a shirt that said \u00e2\u0080\u009cSave the planet, eat the children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d stood up during a town hall event in Queens. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so happy that you are really supporting a Green New Deal, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the unidentified woman told Ocasio-Cortez and the packed room. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if we were to bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution. So we have to get rid of the babies. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big problem. Just stopping having babies is not enough. We need to eat the babies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite the lawmaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to calm the woman down, Trump retweeted it, calling Ocasio-Cortez \u00e2\u0080\u009ca wack job!\u00e2\u0080\u009d In its tweet, LaRouche PAC claimed the stunt was meant to be commentary similar to Jonathan Swift\u00e2\u0080\u0099s famed satire on baby-eating, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Modest Proposal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the group tweeted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMalthusianism isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t new, Jonathan Swift knew that.

The campaign made national headlines and Dukakis was forced to release\u00c2\u00a0medical records\u00c2\u00a0refuting the claim.

The group posted photos to Facebook on October 2 that shows people with signs like \u00e2\u0080\u009cEat the Children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as well as other more earnest messages in support of Donald Trump.

      "author": "Carol Kuruvilla",
      "content": " A secular advocacy organization has accused a Dallas judge of violating the separation of church and state by proselytizing to a convicted murderer in the courtroom during the final moments of a high-profile case. The Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) said Thursday that Judge Tammy Kemp crossed an ethical line by sharing a Bible and Christian teachings about sin and salvation with Amber Guyger, a former Dallas police officer sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in jail\u00c2\u00a0for the September 2018 shooting and killing of unarmed Black man Botham Shem Jean. Guyger, who is white, shot Jean in his own apartment, which she claimed she mistook for her own. Courtroom video shows the 204th District Court judge approaching Guyger with a Bible, which she says is her own. At that point, Guyger had already been sentenced, and the jury had been dismissed, The Associated Press reports. In the video, the judge,\u00c2\u00a0still dressed in her official robes, is seen opening the Bible and pointing to a verse. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is your job for the next month. Right here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kemp can be heard saying in the video. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJohn: 3:16. And this is where you start.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kemp then reads the Bible verse aloud. The popular verse is considered by many Christians to be a summation of the faith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s teachings about salvation. The verse states, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kemp recommends that Guyger read the entire book of John. The conversation continues for over a minute and Guyger can be seen nodding along. Guyger then rises and hugs Kemp, who embraces her back. After at least another minute of conversation and a second hug, Guyger is led away. FFRF\u00c2\u00a0filed a complaint\u00c2\u00a0Thursday with the Texas State Commission on Judicial Conduct, insisting that Kemp was promoting her personal religious beliefs while acting in her official capacity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was in a government courtroom, dressed in a judicial robe, with all of the imprimatur of the state, including armed law enforcement officers, preaching to someone who was quite literally a captive audience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d FFRF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter reads. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDelivering bibles, bible studies and personal witness as a judge is an abuse of power.\u00e2\u0080\u009d FFRF is asking the commission to investigate Kemp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions. Prosecutors had requested Guyger serve at least 28 years.\u00c2\u00a0She will be eligible for parole in five years. Earlier in the trial, Kemp permitted Jean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s younger brother Brandt Jean to hug Guyger while delivering his victim impact statement. The younger brother said he forgave Guyger, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think she should go to jail, and said he hoped she would dedicate her life to Jesus. FFRF said that while it is \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfectly acceptable\u00e2\u0080\u009d for Brandt Jean to express religious beliefs in court, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe rules are different for those acting in a governmental role.\u00e2\u0080\u009d HuffPost has reached out to Kemp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office for comment. Kemp ran as a Democrat during her bid for office in 2014, AP reports. During her campaign, she reportedly placed an ad in a local magazine where she called herself a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwoman of faith with strong Christian values\u00e2\u0080\u009d and revealed that she and her husband had fasted and prayed about her decision to run. Rachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said that judges acting in their official capacity must not proselytize. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy distributing a Bible and telling the defendant it is her \u00e2\u0080\u0098job\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to read a religious text as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on her way to prison, Judge Kemp has sent a message to all defendants who come before her that their religious beliefs could affect the outcomes of their cases and their sentences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Laser told HuffPost. Monica L. Miller, legal director for the American Humanist Association, said that her advocacy organization isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t planning legal action over the issue at this time. But she said Kemp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior \u00e2\u0080\u009cobliterated\u00e2\u0080\u009d the line between church and state. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCompassion belongs in our courtrooms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPersonal bibles, admonishments to follow John 3:16, and Christian privilege do not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

The former presidential candidate doubled down on his criticisms of President Donald\u00c2\u00a0Trump in a series of tweets Friday morning, calling Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrazen and unprecedented\u00e2\u0080\u009d calls for foreign meddling in the 2020 election \u00e2\u0080\u009cwrong and appalling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Romney was among the first Republicans to speak out on the allegations, which first appeared in a whistleblower report alleging that Trump ordered aid to Ukraine withheld unless the country delivered him a political favor. In response, Trump mocked Romney, referencing the senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failed 2012 presidential bid against incumbent President Barack Obama. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous \u00e2\u0080\u0098ass\u00e2\u0080\u0099 who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give it to him),\u00e2\u0080\u009d the president tweeted. On Thursday, while attempting to defend his actions, Trump instead openly asked another foreign government, China, to also influence the 2020 election. Hours later, CNN reported Trump had brought up the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical prospects\u00e2\u0080\u009d of former Vice President Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren while on a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping in June. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme\u00e2\u0080\u009d Romney said last week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCritical for the facts to come out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse (R) echoed that sentiment last Wednesday after he read the complaint. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis [is] going to take a long time but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously some very troubling things here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sasse told CNN at the time. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I think the partisan tribalism that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always insta-certain is a terrible idea. There are real troubling things here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cRepublicans ought not just circle the wagons and Democrats ought not be using words like \u00e2\u0080\u0098impeach\u00e2\u0080\u0099 before they know anything about the actual substance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sasse continued. Meanwhile, much of the rest of the Republican Party seems content parroting the same lines members used during the Mueller probe. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Wednesday baselessly accused Democrats\u00c2\u00a0of having \u00e2\u0080\u009crigged\u00e2\u0080\u009d the process, while House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) retreated to conspiracy theories and blamed it on \u00e2\u0080\u009ca deep state scheme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Antonia Blumberg",
      "content": " Kurt Volker, the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former special envoy to Ukraine, on Thursday became the first witness to testify in the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. In prepared remarks obtained Friday\u00c2\u00a0by BuzzFeed News, Volker told members of Congress that during his tenure with the department he was unaware of the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential 2020 opponent. But Volker turned over text messages to Congress that indicate he likely knew more than he acknowledged. The texts exchanges involved Volker, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine. Some of the messages were sent from Volker to Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In one of the messages,\u00c2\u00a0Volker texted Yermak just hours before Trump and Zelensky were set to speak. Volker said the White House would work to \u00e2\u0080\u009cnail down the date for [a] visit to Washington\u00e2\u0080\u009d but only on the assumption that \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Z convinces trump he will investigate/\u00e2\u0080\u0098get to the bottom of what happened\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in 2016.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Volker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name also appears several times in the whistleblower complaint\u00c2\u00a0from a member of the intelligence community that sparked\u00c2\u00a0the impeachment inquiry. It claimed Volker advised Ukrainian leaders on how to \u00e2\u0080\u009cnavigate\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requests. The complaint focused on a July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, during which the U.S. president pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to look into unsubstantiated allegations that Biden used his power as vice president during the Obama administration to kill an investigation into a gas company for which his son was a board member. Volker told investigators on Thursday that he was not \u00e2\u0080\u009cfully in the loop\u00e2\u0080\u009d about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intentions, that he was in Ukraine at the time of the call and that he was not subsequently shown a transcript of the conversation, according to The New York Times. Volker abruptly resigned from his State Department post last week without explanation and voluntarily agreed to appear before House investigators as part of their inquiry into whether Trump abused his power to pressure a foreign government for dirt on a political rival. The next witness in the inquiry is expected to be Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0Trump reportedly recalled Yovanovitch after his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani complained she was undermining the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to pressure Ukrainian leaders to investigate the Bidens.

The House oversight, intelligence and foreign affairs committee chairs sent a joint letter\u00c2\u00a0on Friday asking Pence to comply with their request by Oct. 15. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRecently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stark message to the Ukrainian President,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0the chairs told Pence.

In their letter, the chairs cited an Oct. 2 report from The Washington Post stating that Trump repeatedly \u00e2\u0080\u009cused\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pence \u00e2\u0080\u009cin efforts to exert pressure on the leader of Ukraine at a time when [Trump] was using other channels to solicit information that he hoped would be damaging to a Democratic rival.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pence spokeswoman Katie Waldman said in a statement that the letter \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes not appear to be a serious request\u00e2\u0080\u009d but \u00e2\u0080\u009c[g]iven the scope, just another attempt by the Do Nothing Democrats to call attention to their partisan agenda.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the letter to the vice president came with a warning: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour failure or refusal to comply with the request, including at the direction or behest of the President or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you or the President.\u00e2\u0080\u009d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump late last month, following a damning whistleblower complaint suggesting the president may have withheld security aid to Ukraine in exchange for political favors and attempted to cover it up.

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " SAN DIEGO \u00e2\u0080\u0095 A new poll confirms that a tight three-way race is developing in California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s key Democratic presidential primary, with one candidate showing impressive momentum: Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. A\u00c2\u00a0survey released Thursday by the Public Policy Institute of California showed\u00c2\u00a0Warren the choice of 23% of likely primary voters, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 22% and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at 21%. When the Democratic race was first taking shape in the spring, a Quinnipiac Poll had shown Warren in single digits in the Golden State, far behind Biden, Sanders and California Sen. Kamala Harris. Indeed, as Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support has surged in California \u00e2\u0080\u0095 as it has nationally \u00e2\u0080\u0095 the prospects for Harris in her home state have taken a hit, again reflecting national trends. Perhaps the new poll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most striking finding is that Harris trailed well behind the pack with just 8% support, another sign of trouble for her struggling campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWarren may well be a beneficiary of Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 collapse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said veteran California Democratic strategist Garry South. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince her very impressive debut (as a White House candidate) in Oakland in January, Harris has done little in California to solidify whatever support may have been potentially there for her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Voters like Cindy Henderson, an author who showed up to hear Warren speak Thursday as the candidate made her first campaign stop in San Diego, give a glimpse into the race\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current dynamics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was actually a Kamala fan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Henderson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust something in the last two or three months, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just kind of dropping off [on her]. I think she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not quite ready. I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much depth yet. The more I hear and watch what Elizabeth does, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just like, OK, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a rock star. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m loving her message.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren drew about 8,500 people for her rally in downtown San Diego. (A rally for Sanders was attended by an estimated 6,400 people at the same venue in May). Like most of Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audiences, her Thursday crowd was predominantly white \u00e2\u0080\u0095 which aligns with how her support breaks down in public opinion surveys, as well. A UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll\u00c2\u00a0released in late September showed her leading the California race with 29%, with Biden at 21% and Sanders at 20%. But Warren trailed both of those two with Latino voters. Warren mostly stuck to her populist stump speech on Thursday, laying out her plans to take on Washington corruption, special interests and big corporations. She appeared to choke up at one point as she recalled the family struggles that marked her childhood in Oklahoma, including the time her mother lost her job. The story is a big hit with many voters, who cite it when discussing the candidate. At one point, after discussing her plan to break up big tech companies, Warren called out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who told employees in recently leaked audio the company would \u00e2\u0080\u009cgo to the mat\u00e2\u0080\u009d to defeat her efforts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking at you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, to cheers and applause from the audience. The true contours of the Democratic battle will emerge in February when the narrative-driving nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina take place. But right around the corner comes primaries in 14 states on March 3, Super Tuesday. And California is the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dominant contest, with 416 convention delegates allotted. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why so many of the main Democratic contenders are paying frequent visits to the state to meet with voters \u00e2\u0080\u0095 as well as well-heeled donors. Also, early mail-in voting begins a month before the actual primary date. And conquering California presents unique challenges for a politician: its\u00c2\u00a0population is decidedly more diverse than that in the earlier-voting states, campaign ads are far more expensive than in those other locales and gaining media attention is difficult. In terms of having the money to compete, Warren and Sanders are well-primed as the race enters the final stretch before primary season. Warren raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, her campaign told supporters in an email Friday, and has $25.7 million cash on hand. Sanders, hospitalized earlier this week in Nevada because of a blocked artery, raised $25.3 million from July to September (his campaign didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t release a cash-on-hand figure). Their figures are especially impressive because both candidates have opted against holding fundraisers focused on big-dollar donors during the primary campaign. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, meanwhile, reported a lackluster $15.2 million raised over the past three months, far less than his second-quarter haul of $21.5 million. He could be in trouble if his fundraising continues to taper off. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee announced raising a combined $125 million in the third quarter, a record-setting haul. His war chest will only grow as Democrats spend several months \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and maybe more, in the case of a lengthy primary battle \u00e2\u0080\u0095 determining their nominee. Warren dismissed Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s haul on Thursday, telling reporters she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think \u00e2\u0080\u009cscooping up a bunch of money from rich people and buying a bunch of TV ads\u00e2\u0080\u009d is \u00e2\u0080\u009chow democracy works anymore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be about going out and building a grassroots movement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Given Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steady rise in the primary race, the Oct. 15 Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, looms particularly large for her. As the frontrunner in several of the race\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most recent national polls, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll likely have a bigger target on her back. Even as Warren received enthusiastic backing at her San Diego rally, interviews with some of the undecided voters at it underscored some of the doubts she still most overcome. Corinne Lytle-Bonine, an environmental consultant who voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary, acknowledged she was giving Warren a strong look this time around. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving the nomination be another old white man is a hard pill to swallow when it feels like women have been the ones really carrying the Democrats through 2018,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lytle-Bonine said. She added that \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Warren has some establishment credentials that Bernie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and may make her more electable in the general election.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still, Lytle-Bonine questioned why Warren has been hesitant to acknowledge whether the middle class would see a tax hike if, as president, she would push into law \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedicare-for-All\u00e2\u0080\u009d government health care plan Sanders has introduced and that she supports. Several of Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rivals have criticized her for repeatedly dodging the question; she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brushed off the attacks as unfair Republican framing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish that she would\u00e2\u0080\u009d directly deal with that issue, Lytle-Bonine said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what is holding her back. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hard answer to say \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll raise taxes, however, all of your out-of-pocket expenses (for health care) go away.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": " President Donald Trump insisted Friday that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Republicans are very unified\u00e2\u0080\u009d in supporting him amid accusations that he improperly asked foreign leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 political rival. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not entirely true. While the Democratic-controlled House begins an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conversations with the Ukrainian government about Biden, which were revealed after a whistleblower complaint, cracks are beginning to show in the Republican Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s front. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public call Thursday for China to investigate Biden, too, appears to have pushed some members of the GOP over the edge. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a running list of Republicans who are speaking out about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparent attempts to compel foreign governments to aid his reelection campaign. Sen. Mitt Romney\u00c2\u00a0of Utah made the biggest splash Friday of any Republican so far when he slammed Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrazen and unprecedented\u00e2\u0080\u009d calls for foreign meddling in the 2020 presidential election as \u00e2\u0080\u009cwrong and appalling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Romney said. The week before, Romney also spoke out about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July phone call with the president of Ukraine. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott was the first Republican governor to publicly support an impeachment inquiry into Trump. The action is \u00e2\u0080\u009cappropriate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in late September. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongress has a solemn responsibility to every American to fulfill its role in our government system of checks and balances,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker also told reporters in September that he supported an impeachment inquiry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deeply disturbing situation and circumstance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I think the proper role and responsibility for Congress at this point is to investigate it and get to the bottom of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Republican Jim Steineke, the GOP leader of the Wisconsin State Assembly, took a stand against Trump on Friday after the president insisted on Twitter that he was right to ask other countries to investigate Biden. His behavior \u00e2\u0080\u009ccannot be normalized,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Steineke tweeted. Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t defend Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions when speaking to reporters in September. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously some very troubling things here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, though he stopped short of supporting an impeachment inquiry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDemocrats ought not to be using the word \u00e2\u0080\u0098impeach\u00e2\u0080\u0099 before they had the whistleblower complaint or read any of the transcript,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, referring to the July 25 call with the Ukraine president. But he also criticized Republicans for turning a blind eye. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRepublicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no there there when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously a lot that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very troubling there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, one of several Republican lawmakers to announce in recent months that he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seek reelection, told CNN last week that copies of text messages exchanged among U.S. diplomats about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions \u00e2\u0080\u009care indeed damning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think this is serious stuff; these are serious matters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis has long-term implications on our foreign policy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public call for China to investigate Biden, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis terrible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sen. Susan Collins, another fairly regular Trump critic, told reporters over the weekend that she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand by his comments about China. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely inappropriate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She also said she expected the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment probe would make its way to the Senate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShould the articles of impeachment come to the Senate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and right now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to guess that they will \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I will be acting as a juror as I did in the Clinton impeachment trial,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Collins said. Rob Portman of Ohio said there was no question as to whether Trump was wrong to bring Biden up with the Ukrainians. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president should not have raised the Biden issue on that call, period,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told The Columbus Dispatch on Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not appropriate for a president to engage a foreign government in an investigation of a political opponent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, he also said he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t view that as an impeachable offense. Portman, notably, was among a bipartisan group of senators in 2016 who wrote a letter to Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president criticizing a Ukrainian prosecutor for corruption in his office. That prosecutor is the same one Trump has baselessly insisted Biden unfairly targeted because he was investigating a Ukrainian company for which his son, Hunter Biden, served on the board \u00e2\u0080\u0095 the relationship at the center of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request that Ukraine dig up dirt on the Bidens.

      "content": " The House Oversight Committee on Friday issued a subpoena to the White House for documents pertaining to the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contacts with Ukraine. The subpoena comes amid the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump in the wake of an intelligence community whistleblower complaint that alleges the president abused his power to pressure Ukrainian leaders for damaging information about his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. The White House didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t immediately respond to a request for comment. The subpoena was addressed to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and signed by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), chairman of the House Oversight Committee; Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee; and Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It states that Mulvaney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to comply, even at Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay be used as an adverse inference against you and the President.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe White House has refused to engage with \u00e2\u0080\u0095 or even respond to \u00e2\u0080\u0095 multiple requests for documents from our Committees on a voluntary basis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the subpoena read. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter nearly a month of stonewalling, it appears clear that the President has chosen the path of defiance, obstruction, and cover-up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The subpoena ends: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe deeply regret that President Trump has put us \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and the nation \u00e2\u0080\u0095 in this position, but his actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The House oversight, intelligence, and foreign affairs committee chairs also sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence\u00c2\u00a0on Friday asking him to produce documents related to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Ukraine. House investigators on Thursday heard from their first witness in the probe, Kurt Volker, who was the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former special envoy to Ukraine before he abruptly resigned last week. The House is looking into whether Trump was seeking a quid pro quo agreement from Ukraine when he asked the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president in a July 25 phone call to investigate Biden. At the center of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demand was the unsubstantiated allegation that then-Vice President Biden used his power to kill an investigation into a gas company for which his son, Hunter Biden, worked. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in his interactions with Ukrainian leaders.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been released from a Las Vegas hospital three days after a heart attack, his doctors revealed in a statement through his presidential campaign Friday.

      "author": "Arthur Delaney",
      "content": " An internal agency watchdog will review whether the Trump administration failed to follow regular procedures when it denied a congressional request for President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax returns. The acting inspector general for the Treasury Department, which oversees the Internal Revenue Service, will conduct the inquiry in response to a request from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.). Neal asked Monday for the inspector make sure Treasury and the IRS are \u00e2\u0080\u009cenforcing the law in a fair an impartial manner and no one is endeavoring to intimidate or impede government officials and employees carrying out their duties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Acting inspector general Rich Delmar confirmed he would undertake the inquiry in an email on Friday, according to the New York Times. The IRS automatically audits the president and vice president every year, and over the summer a whistleblower complained to Congress that someone had tried to interfere with that audit. The tax whistleblower has received renewed attention as another whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint \u00e2\u0080\u0095 that the president corrupted U.S. foreign policy for his own electoral benefit \u00e2\u0080\u0095 has prompted Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. Neal quietly revealed the existence of the tax whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint in an August court filing that said a federal employee had come forward with \u00e2\u0080\u009cevidence of possible misconduct.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Ways and Means Committee has sued the administration over its refusal to hand over copies of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taxes under a federal law that says the Treasury secretary \u00e2\u0080\u009cshall\u00e2\u0080\u009d do so. There will probably be plenty for the IG to investigate. The tax disclosure law has been on the books since 1924, and Democrats have contended in their court filings that the IRS has never before refused to hand over a tax return requested by a congressional tax committee. The IRS didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hesitate to hand over tax material on President Richard Nixon, for instance, when lawmakers asked for it in the 1970s. Trump is the first president since Nixon to keep his taxes a secret. An internal IRS memo that surfaced earlier this year said the law gives the bureau no wiggle room to refuse requests. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the IG will focus on process,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the IRS refusal was unprecedented and illegal and I think it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow the ordinary course of any other request.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another line of investigation could focus on Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to intervene in the tax return request, which is typically handled by the IRS without the Treasury secretary butting in. But if the IG finds that the Treasury Department failed to follow the law or its own procedures, the finding would likely have little practical effect, as the agency could simply ignore it. And the inspector would likely reach his conclusion after a long time, meaning not this year and possibly not next year, either. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will come much too late,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rosenthal said.",

This second intelligence official is considering bringing their own whistleblower complaint to Congress, though they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet done so. A potential second whistleblower would further implicate Trump. The first complaint said he abused his power by pressuring Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president to dig up information on former Vice President Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential rival. The report of a second government official with even more information may add fuel to the House impeachment investigation. Also on Friday night, the House Oversight Committee\u00c2\u00a0issued a subpoena\u00c2\u00a0to the White House, ordering the Trump administration to hand over documents on its contacts with Ukraine.

Marco Rubio\u00c2\u00a0(R-Fla.) appeared so very unconcerned Friday about Donald Trump calling on China to investigate his political rival Joe Biden that he had a difficult time presenting a coherent defense. Trump, speaking to reporters outside the White House on Thursday, urged China to investigate the former vice president, just hours before CNN reported that he had raised the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical prospects\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Biden \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Sen.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The State Department has been deeply shaken by the rapidly escalating impeachment inquiry, as revelations that President Donald Trump enlisted diplomats to dig up dirt on a political rival threaten to tarnish its reputation as a nonpartisan arm of U.S. foreign policy, former senior officials said Friday. A department where morale was already low under a president who, at times, has seemed hostile to its mission is now reeling from days of disclosures that place it at the center of an escalating political scandal, say former diplomats who fear that the turmoil will damage American foreign policy objectives around the world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis has just been a devastating three years for the Department of State,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heather Conley, a senior policy adviser at State under President George W. Bush. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can just feel there is a sense of disbelief. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know who will be subpoenaed next.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The first blow was the release of a rough transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which the American president pressed for an investigation of the son of former Vice President Joe Biden. In the call, the president also disparaged the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who was removed from her post in May amid a campaign coordinated by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Thursday saw the release of text messages between Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker and two senior diplomats as they scrambled to accommodate Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign to leverage American support for Ukraine in a search for potential political dirt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is only the latest in a large number of very damaging things that have been done to the State Department,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Thomas Pickering, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Russia under President George H.W. Bush. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt represents a new low in basically ignoring and indeed punishing the people who have made a professional commitment to the country and Constitution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With Washington in tumult over the escalating impeachment inquiry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo toured southeast Europe on Friday, trying to ignore the furor back home. He did not respond to shouted questions on the topic from journalists at photo opportunities in Podgorica, Montenegro, and Ohrid, North Macedonia, and no questions were allowed at his scheduled press events in the two cities. His staff steadfastly refused to comment on the latest developments in the rapidly unfolding drama, including at a briefing for reporters at his last stop of the day in Athens. Earlier this week in Rome, Pompeo acknowledged for the first time that he had been on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy. House Democrats launched the impeachment probe over the Ukraine matter after a government whistleblower disclosed Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with Zelenskiy and the push to have a foreign government interfere in U.S. elections by digging up dirt on Biden. Trump has sought, without evidence, to implicate Biden and his son Hunter in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son. Trump has had a tense relationship with the State Department since he took office, repeatedly proposing to slash its budget, leaving key posts unfulfilled and choosing political appointees over career foreign service officers for ambassadorships to a greater degree than other recent presidents have. His ouster of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, a respected career officer, and his dismissal of her as \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad news\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the call left many diplomats dismayed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a workforce that already feels besieged and undercut and in a perpetual defensive crouch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Derek Chollet, a former senior policy adviser in the Defense Department and State Department. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe lack of a vigorous defense of her is a signal that they are very vulnerable here. It just confirms their worst fears.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Conley, now a program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the State Department had settled down a bit under Pompeo following the chaotic early part of the administration under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. But now, she said, diplomats are conflicted and confused because everything has happened outside normal channels, with no regard for long-held processes. Conley said that during her tenure at the department, even when there were disagreements between senior leaders, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere was a respect for hierarchy and the process.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And when something went wrong, there was a chain of command and a process that protected people. But that has changed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one knows what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen next,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Conley said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all trying their best, but no one is untouched, no one is unharmed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said foreign leaders who come to Washington can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make progress on important issues because the Ukraine furor overwhelms the conversation, as it did during a visit by the president of Finland earlier this week. Other former officials and diplomats say U.S. standing around the world has been weakened. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven a hint of the President using the power of his office to advance his personal interests in an upcoming domestic election will undermine the U.S. in diplomacy and military affairs significantly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially with our NATO allies, who are following all of this closely with real concern,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral who was the top NATO commander in Europe from 2009 to 2013. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have come into a situation where not only unpredictability is the hallmark of the United States, but unreliability as well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pickering said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe wisdom and judgment that the United States was known for has been diminished.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "subtitle": "As Duke Energy preps renewal requests for its reactors, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear how the leading candidates would rule on a major issue in carbon-free power.",
      "author": "Alexander C. Kaufman",
      "content": " One of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest utilities last month announced plans to request new licenses for 11 nuclear reactors, setting up a critical new test for Democratic presidential candidates on how to achieve zero-carbon energy generation. Duke Energy, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, said it plans to submit its renewal applications for reactors at six power plants in the Carolinas starting in 2021, which could put those decisions in the hands of a new White House if a Democrat unseats President Donald Trump next year. As it stands, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear where the top contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination would stand on relicensing. Despite intense focus on energy and climate policy, on which there are clear divisions among the candidates, the issue of nuclear power has largely been ignored in the Democratic debates. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and businessman Andrew Yang are all in, pledging to keep open safe plants and invest heavily in researching advanced reactors. On the opposite end of the spectrum is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who promised to halt construction on new reactors and issue a moratorium on nuclear plant license renewals. The views of the candidates in between are less certain. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) endorsed erstwhile climate candidate Jay Inslee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal, which calls for keeping existing nuclear plants open. But at a CNN town hall last month, she vowed to start \u00e2\u0080\u009cweaning ourselves off nuclear energy\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the goal of shutting down existing plants by 2035. Former Vice President Joe Biden, long a critic of the nuclear industry, proposed new funding for advanced reactors but hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taken a definitive position on extending the lives of existing nuclear plants. Warren and Biden, now the top two in several polls, gave \u00e2\u0080\u009cunclear\u00e2\u0080\u009d responses to The Washington Post\u00e2\u0080\u0099s survey on nuclear energy.\u00c2\u00a0The Biden, Warren and Sanders campaigns did not respond to requests for comments on the record. The case for nuclear power as a source of low-carbon energy is fairly straightforward. Reactors currently produce 20% of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electricity, while hydroelectric, wind and solar power combined generate 17%. The only country that has significantly slashed emissions while remaining an industrial powerhouse is France, which converted over 70% of its power generation to nuclear after 1979. Halving global emissions in the next decade \u00e2\u0080\u0095 which scientific projections say governments must do to avoid catastrophic warming \u00e2\u0080\u0095 would require unprecedented changes to the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy systems. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot harder to make those changes without at least maintaining existing nuclear reactors. The United States would need to increase renewable power generation from 0.6% to 2% per year to achieve net-zero emissions from the utility sector by 2050, according to calculations from assistant professor Leah Stokes of the University of California, Santa Barbara. To totally eliminate emissions from vehicles, the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top source of planet-heating gas, the U.S. would need to double its electrical output and increase construction of renewable energy projects sevenfold \u00e2\u0080\u0095\u00c2\u00a0 a mammoth undertaking, particularly when the worldwide buildout of renewable energy projects is in decline for the first time since 2001. But hitting that target by 2030 without adding new nuclear plants, as Warren has proposed, would require the deployment rate of renewable energy projects to increase 17 times faster than the current average. Under Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 plan, which aims to decarbonize the energy sector while decommissioning nuclear reactors, it would need to be 25 times faster. The case against new nuclear plants is also fairly straightforward. Nuclear waste remains toxic for 250,000 years, roughly the same amount of time since early humans first evolved. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no good way to store spent fuel rods, despite recent progress in storing waste in remote underground caverns in Northern Europe and developing powerful lasers to alter atomic nuclei. That makes existing plants radioactive, literally and politically, particularly in a heated primary. Nevada, where the federal government has long stored waste in desert facilities and has proposed a controversial waste storage facility in Yucca Mountain, is an early-voting primary state, and nuclear storage is a top concern there. Nuclear plants are extremely expensive, both to build and operate. The only new nuclear plant under construction, in Georgia, is running about four years behind schedule, and its cost surged to $28 billion last year, double the initial estimate of $14.1 billion. And it could climb higher. South Carolina spent $9 billion on two new reactors only to abandon the project over costs and delays after hiking electricity rates in the state to cover nearly $4 billion of the cost overruns. Despite campaigning heavily in the early-voting Palmetto State, presidential hopefuls have yet to even remark there on that textbook pocketbook issue, said Tom Clements, an environmental activist in South Carolina. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have the gall to come here and they just ignore it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of the costs. The high cost of building nuclear plants makes it impossible to compete with cheap fracked gas as coal plants are shuttered at a steady pace. Putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions \u00e2\u0080\u0095 or, at the very least, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies \u00e2\u0080\u0095 would make it easier for the industry to compete against gas. But nuclear\u00e2\u0080\u0099s carbon-free rivals are catching up. Wind and solar generators outcompeted nuclear plants in mid-2019 on both cost and construction speed, the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report found. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStabilizing the climate is urgent, nuclear power is slow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mycle Schneider, lead author of the report, told Reuters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt meets no technical or operational need that low-carbon competitors cannot meet better, cheaper and faster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partly why no new reactors have been licensed in a quarter of a century. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also why 59 of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currently licensed 97 reactors face retirement by 2040, including 11 whose credentials expire by 2025. But extending licenses on existing reactors is another story. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like renewing your driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t view it as a litmus test,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Neal Cohen, a vice president at the industry-backed Nuclear Energy Institute. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLicense renewal is not a controversial idea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At a moment when HBO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hit series \u00e2\u0080\u009cChernobyl\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, offer stark reminders of how destructive radiation can be, Clements took a markedly different view of extending licenses on reactors already relicensed once before. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese reactors get older, the components age and there are safety risks associated with that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. But Duke Energy instead pointed to the threat of inflaming the climate crisis with increased emissions. The utility\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing nuclear fleet \u00e2\u0080\u009cavoided the release of about 54 million tons of carbon dioxide \u00e2\u0080\u0095 equivalent to keeping more than 10 million passenger cars off the road,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company said. The move, moreover, was part of a broader announcement last month that Duke planned to halve its emissions by 2030 and zero them out by 2050. That, Duke spokesperson Rita Sipe said, is why the company is announcing the renewals now. The first reactors for which Duke plans to apply for renewals are at its Oconee plant in Greenville, South Carolina. Nuclear Regulatory Commission filings show the credentials for the three reactors there don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expire until 2033. But the company \u00e2\u0080\u009cprojects years into the future.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the U.S. nuclear industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s precarious outlook makes predictions difficult. Yet shoring up political support from a potential next president could be essential. And while a Duke spokeswoman declined to \u00e2\u0080\u009cspeak directly to the politics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0South Carolina Democrats go to the polls at the end of February to decide whom that might be. Clarification: Duke Energy plans to start submitting renewal applications for nuclear reactors in 2021, not to submit them all that year.",

An August whistleblower complaint called Giuliani a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccentral figure\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the matter, and warned that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action was a solicitation of election interference targeting the Democratic frontrunner. House lawmakers including Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.)\u00c2\u00a0subpoenaed Giuliani\u00c2\u00a0on Monday for documents concerning Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to pressure Ukraine for help, which he has been ordered to produce by Oct. 15. On Thursday,\u00c2\u00a0former State Department special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker testified to congressional investigators that Giuliani had insisted that Ukraine agree to pursue probes of the 2016 election and a Ukrainian energy firm on whose board Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son once served, The New York Times reported. Text messages released the same day and published by The Washington Post revealed that U.S. diplomats believed Trump would not meet with Zelensky without first securing Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to the investigations. The communications also showed that Volker set Giuliani up with a Zelensky aide for a phone call, after which Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now-infamous July conversation with Zelensky took place.",

The outlet cited five individuals familiar with the plan, some of whom described it as an effort to downsize the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foreign policy arm under Robert O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien, who was named national security adviser last month. The request was reportedly shared this week with senior NSC officials by both O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. The White House did not immediately return HuffPost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for comment on the matter. The news comes amid mounting scandal over Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which he pressed Zelensky repeatedly to assist lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr with a corruption investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, based on unsubstantiated accusations. A whistleblower complaint filed in August by a member of the intelligence community states that Trump was essentially asking Ukraine to meddle in the\u00c2\u00a0 2020 election by investigating a political rival. There remains no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens. The complaint also states that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmultiple White House officials\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a transcript of the call was stored in a computer system managed by the NSC Directorate for Intelligence Programs, which is \u00e2\u0080\u009creserved for codeword-level intelligence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccording to information I received from White House officials, some officials voiced concerns internally that this would be an abuse of the system and was not consistent with the responsibilities of the Directorate for Intelligence Programs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the complaint reads. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccording to White House officials I spoke with, this was \u00e2\u0080\u0098not the first time\u00e2\u0080\u0099 under this Administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u00e2\u0080\u0095 rather than national security sensitive \u00e2\u0080\u0095 information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Texts released on Thursday and published by The Washington Post give further insight into the role of Giuliani, American diplomats and Zelensky aide Andrey Yermak in facilitating Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communication.

During Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s episode of \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeet The Press,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Todd asked Johnson why he said he \u00e2\u0080\u009cwinced\u00e2\u0080\u009d when a U.S. ambassador told him that aid to Ukraine was contingent on an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a frontrunner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. But Johnson, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee, dodged the question and instead pushed a conspiracy theory about the origins of Robert Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Russia investigation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does this have to do with Ukraine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Todd interrupted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no idea why a Fox News conspiracy propaganda stuff is popping up on here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson responded by defending Trump and his supporters for being \u00e2\u0080\u009cupset\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the media. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not about the media,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Todd cut in, growing visibly frustrated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSenator Johnson, please. Can we please answer the question that I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not criticizing him? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just trying to ask a simple question.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson then acknowledged that he was upset to hear military aid was being withheld until Ukraine committed to investigate Biden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want those connected,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the salient point of why I came forward: When I asked the president about that, he completely denied it. ... He said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never do that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 So that is the piece of the puzzle that I am here to report today.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not trying to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefend\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdenounce\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump, but that he simply wants the truth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only dealing with the facts that we have, not the facts that you wish them to be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Todd said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making a choice not to believe the investigations that have taken place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson was part of the delegation, along with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, that traveled to Ukraine in May for the inauguration of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky. After the visit, Johnson told The Wall Street Journal that he told Trump that he was confident in Zelensky as a leader. Trump later pressed Zelensky during a July phone call to look into Biden. A U.S. intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint in August regarding the call and alleging the White House tried to cover it up. Trump claims Biden, as vice president, demanded the notoriously corrupt prosecutor general in Ukraine be fired for the purpose of impeding an investigation into a Ukrainian gas company where his son, Hunter, served on the board. No evidence has been brought to light to suggest this and Ukrainian authorities have cleared Biden of any wrongdoing. A 2016 bipartisan letter signed by Johnson and several other Republican senators expressed concern over Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009centrenched corruption\u00e2\u0080\u009d and echoed Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support for reforming the prosecutor general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office. During a subsequent interview with Todd on Sunday, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeeply scared\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Republicans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 defense of Trump in the wake of the whistleblower complaint. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat interview was just a giant green light to the president of the United States to continue to solicit foreign interference in presidential elections,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Murphy said of Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exchange with Todd. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis entire country should be scared that at a moment when we need patriots, what we are getting is blind partisan loyalty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

He acknowledged last week that he was one of several U.S. officials on the line during Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The call became the subject of a subsequent whistleblower complaint filed in August by a U.S. intelligence official that prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to open a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Engel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s committee issued a subpoena for Pompeo on Sept. 27 that requested he make five State Department officials available for depositions and turn over a slew of documents related to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ukraine dealings.\u00c2\u00a0The deadline for those documents was Friday. In response, Pompeo accused Engel of trying to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbully\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cintimidate\u00e2\u0080\u009d department officials and claimed the records requested are potentially privileged and restricted. Engel said Sunday that Pompeo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accusations of intimidation are \u00e2\u0080\u009claughable\u00e2\u0080\u009d given the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnumerous complaints\u00e2\u0080\u009d from State Department staffers who have alleged that the Trump administration has discriminated against them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople who were summarily let go or fired because they were deemed to be the wrong political persuasion or the wrong ethnic persuasion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Engel told CBS. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI find it really laughable that the secretary of state suddenly has this great concern for the State Department.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The State Department did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for comment.",

      "author": "Hayley Miller",
      "content": " As Sunday morning political talk shows debated and discussed the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and his dealings with Ukraine, there was a glaring absence from their lineups: White House officials. Last week, senior White House adviser Stephen Miller defended Trump on \u00e2\u0080\u009cFox News Sunday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave interviews to ABC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis Week\u00e2\u0080\u009d and CBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cFace the Nation\u00e2\u0080\u009d the week before. This week birthed several major developments regarding impeachment and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s push for foreign leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, his potential Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential election. But not a single White House official made the Sunday morning rounds this week on the\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cbig five\u00e2\u0080\u009d networks: ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and CNN. The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for comment. Jake Tapper, host of CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cState of the Union,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sunday that his show invited the White House to participate, but it did not offer a guest. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal attorneys,\u00c2\u00a0Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, as well as top Republicans in the House and Senate were also invited but either declined or did not respond, he said. A spokesperson for Fox News said the network was unable to book a White House official for Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s program. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe reached out for relevant White House guests and we were told they were unavailable, so we went with bipartisan members of the House Intelligence committee leading the impeachment inquiry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement. ABC, CBS and NBC did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requests for comment about whether White House officials also snubbed their programs. The lack of White House officials on Sunday shows didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop Trump and his allies from rolling out his defense. Republican lawmakers appeared ready to push the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s narrative on Sunday, shrugging off news that a second whistleblower had come forward with firsthand information about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the center of the impeachment inquiry. Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), a member of the House Intelligence Committee that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigating Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Ukraine, told \u00e2\u0080\u009cFox News Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u009d that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot at all\u00e2\u0080\u009d concerned about a second whistleblower. Giuliani appeared on Fox News late Sunday morning, where he shouted at host Howard Kurtz for pushing back on his Ukraine conspiracy theories. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCould you just listen for one second?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Giuliani shouted at Kurtz, who later shook his head in disbelief. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let me get a sentence out. You contradict me immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear whether ABC, CBS and NBC refrained from inviting Giuliani on their programs Sunday after Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign sent a letter to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig five\u00e2\u0080\u009d networks last week urging them to not invite the former New York City mayor as a guest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a pair of top Biden advisers wrote in the letter. Trump, whose White House hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t given a press briefing in months, fired off a spate of tweets during the Sunday morning shows that attacked Democrats and doubled down on his call for Biden to be investigated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is INCREDIBLE to watch and read the Fake News and how they pull out all stops to protect Sleepy Joe Biden and his thrown out of the Military son, Hunter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the president tweeted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs lawyers & others have stated, as President, I have an OBLIGATION to look into possible, or probable, CORRUPTION!\u00e2\u0080\u009d None of the Republican guests on this week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sunday morning talk shows offered a direct answer when asked if there was a record of Trump asking foreign leaders to investigate any other American besides Biden on corruption.

      "content": " Democratic presidential candidates are demanding answers following the death of a key witness in the trial of Amber Guyger, a white former Dallas police officer convicted of killing an unarmed 26-year-old Black man in his own home. Joshua Brown, 28, was gunned down on Friday night at South Side Flats, an apartment complex where he was a neighbor to Botham Jean, The Dallas Morning News reported. In September 2018, Guyger shot Jean to death, claiming she entered the wrong unit and mistook him for an intruder. She later pleaded not guilty. On Wednesday, Guyger, 31, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Now, politicians want to know what happened to Brown. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m heartsick for Joshua Brown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family and friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Massachusetts Sen.\u00c2\u00a0Elizabeth Warren tweeted Friday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe bravely stepped forward and testified to bring some justice for Botham Jean, and peace for his family. We need answers \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and Joshua Brown and his family need justice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message echoed that of California Sen. Kamala Harris, who praised Brown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cselflessness and courage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and offered prayers for his family and community. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe demand answers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary\u00c2\u00a0Juli\u00c3\u00a1n Castro, billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer\u00c2\u00a0and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg have also spoken out, disturbed by the second killing. In his remarks, Castro called for \u00e2\u0080\u009ca transparent investigation the people of Dallas can trust.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During Guyger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trial, she claimed that upon seeing Jean, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me see your hands\u00e2\u0080\u009d before she shot him. However, Brown,\u00c2\u00a0who lived across the hall, testified that he did not hear her say any such commands, instead describing the sound as \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo people meeting by surprise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the Morning News. Jean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death sparked outrage as yet another example of lethal use of force by law enforcement on a person of color. In a Facebook post on Saturday, Lee Merrit, the lawyer for Jean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family, said the slaying of Brown \u00e2\u0080\u009cunderscores the reality of the black experience in America.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cA former athlete turned entrepreneur \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Brown lived in constant fear that he could be the next victim of gun violence, either state sanctioned or otherwise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have more work to do deal with the constant threats to our community both from within and without. Brown deserves the same justice he sought to ensure the Jean family. The Dallas County criminal justice system must [be] mobilized to identify his killer and see that he is held accountable for this murder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This article has been updated with Buttigieg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement.

      "author": "Amy Russo",
      "content": " Former CIA Director John Brennan said on Sunday that if the political turmoil plaguing the White House were happening in another nation, the American intelligence community would offer a grim assessment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would look at it as a very corrupt government that is under the sway right now of this powerful individual who has been able to just corrupt the institutions and the laws of that country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told NBC News\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Chuck Todd during a \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeet the Press\u00e2\u0080\u009d appearance. Brennan, who is now a senior national security and intelligence analyst for NBC, raised alarm over Republicans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 refusal to speak out against President Donald Trump, who allegedly sought foreign interference in the 2020 election, according to a whistleblower complaint filed in August by an anonymous member of the intelligence community. Prior to Brennan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interview, Todd spoke with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), who stonewalled his questions and launched into a conspiracy-laden defense of the president in which he took aim at Brennan, who is a frequent critic of Trump. His remarks strayed so far from the topic at hand that a visibly exasperated Todd slammed the senator for peddling Fox News \u00e2\u0080\u009cpropaganda\u00e2\u0080\u009d on air. Brennan, who subsequently hit back at Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks, cautioned that he is part of the problem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer a democracy if an autocrat has it in his hands, and people like Johnson and others are putty in his hands, which means that the democratic principles on which this country [was] founded are eroding right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brennan said. At the center of scandal swirling around Trump is a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he pressed Zelensky to assist both Attorney General William Barr and lawyer Rudy Giuliani with a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, based on unsubstantiated corruption accusations. At the time of the discussion, U.S. aid to Ukraine was being withheld. On Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, described the situation to Johnson as a quid pro quo in which the aid was contingent on an agreement to investigate the Bidens. Johnson told the Journal that he then confronted Trump about the matter, and Trump denied that was the case. Appearing uncomfortable with any suggestion of a deal, Johnson told the Journal he\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cwinced\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the notion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy reaction was: Oh, God. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see those two things combined,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. On Sunday, Johnson refused to further explain this concern, claiming Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration has been \u00e2\u0080\u009csabotaged from the day after election.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

The letter is signed by ex-national security officials who served under both Democratic and Republican presidents, including President Donald Trump himself, The Wall Street Journal first reported. The whistleblower remains anonymous, though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been revealed that the person works in the U.S. government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intelligence community. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA responsible whistleblower makes all Americans safer by ensuring that serious wrongdoing can be investigated and addressed, thus advancing the cause of national security to which we have devoted our careers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the former officials, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan and former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, wrote in the letter.

The complaint, which cites several unnamed senior White House officials, accuses the president of pressuring Zelensky to investigate 2020 election rival Joe Biden, whose son Hunter previously had business dealings in Ukraine. The complaint led the House\u00c2\u00a0to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. A summary of the call released by the White House largely corroborates the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allegations. Trump, who has repeatedly described the call as \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d later said on camera that both Ukraine and China should investigate Biden for unsubstantiated claims of corruption. Trump has pushed a conspiracy theory suggesting the rules for whistleblowers used to require firsthand information and changed before the Ukraine whistleblower came forward.\u00c2\u00a0But experts, including the intelligence community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inspector general who reviewed the complaint, said whistleblowers have always been allowed to report on secondhand information. The president has also falsely accused the whistleblower of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctreason\u00e2\u0080\u009d because of the complaint, making veiled threats that the whistleblower should be \u00e2\u0080\u009cdealt with\u00e2\u0080\u009d in violent ways. Trump has repeatedly said he \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeserved\u00e2\u0080\u009d to meet the whistleblower and find out the person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity. The former officials who penned the letter said they \u00e2\u0080\u009capplaud the whistleblower.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs such, he or she has by law the right \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and indeed the responsibility \u00e2\u0080\u0095 to make known, through appropriate channels, indications of serious wrongdoing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is precisely what this whistleblower did; and we applaud the whistleblower not only for living up to that responsibility but also for using precisely the channels made available by federal law for raising such concerns.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They said a whistleblower should be \u00e2\u0080\u009cprotected from certain egregious forms of retaliation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view of the matters discussed in the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint, all Americans should be united in demanding that all branches of our government and all outlets of our media protect this whistleblower and his or her identity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote. Federal law says Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson cannot disclose the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity without the person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consent, unless it is \u00e2\u0080\u009cunavoidable during the course of the investigation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The law also says the whistleblower should not face any \u00e2\u0080\u009caction constituting a reprisal, or threat of reprisal\u00e2\u0080\u009d unless the whistleblower falsified the report. Members of Congress, including Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), have been trying to keep the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity anonymous as lawmakers in the House Intelligence Committee work with the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorneys to set up a meeting. The whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead attorney, Andrew Bakaj, wrote in a Sept. 29 letter that the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers have \u00e2\u0080\u009cserious concerns\u00e2\u0080\u009d about their client\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety.

      "author": "",
      "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 As Rudy Giuliani was pushing Ukrainian officials last spring to investigate one of Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main political rivals, a group of individuals with ties to the president and his personal lawyer were also active in the former Soviet republic. Their aims were profit, not politics. This circle of businessmen and Republican donors touted connections to Giuliani and Trump while trying to install new management at the top of Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s massive state gas company. Their plan was to then steer lucrative contracts to companies controlled by Trump allies, according to two people with knowledge of their plans. Their plan hit a snag after Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko lost his reelection bid to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose conversation with Trump about former Vice President Joe Biden is now at the center of the House impeachment inquiry of Trump. But the effort to install a friendlier management team at the helm of the gas company, Naftogaz, would soon be taken up with Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new president by U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whose slate of candidates included a fellow Texan who is one of Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past political donors. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear if Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to replace board members at Naftogaz were coordinated with the Giuliani allies pushing for a similar outcome, and no one has alleged that there is criminal activity in any of these efforts. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear what role, if any, Giuliani had in helping his clients push to get gas sales agreements with the state-owned company. But the affair shows how those with ties to Trump and his administration were pursuing business deals in Ukraine that went far beyond advancing the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal political interests. It also raises questions about whether Trump allies were mixing business and politics just as Republicans were calling for a probe of Biden and his son Hunter, who served five years on the board of another Ukrainian energy company, Burisma. On Friday, according to the news site Axios, Trump told a group of Republican lawmakers that it had been Perry who had prompted the phone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfavor\u00e2\u0080\u009d regarding Biden. Axios cited a source saying Trump said Perry had asked Trump to make the call to discuss \u00e2\u0080\u009csomething about an LNG (liquefied natural gas) plant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear whether Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remark Friday referred specifically to the behind-the-scenes maneuvers this spring involving the multibillion-dollar state gas company, The Associated Press has interviewed four people with direct knowledge of the attempts to influence Naftogaz, and their accounts show Perry playing a key role in the effort. Three of the four spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. The fourth is an American businessman with close ties to the Ukrainian energy sector. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Energy Department said Perry, a former Texas governor and Republican presidential candidate, was not advancing anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal interests. She said his conversations with Ukrainian officials about Naftogaz were part of his efforts to reform the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy sector and create an environment where Western companies can do business. The Trump and Giuliani allies driving the attempt to change the senior management at Naftogazt, however, appear to have had inside knowledge of the U.S. government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans in Ukraine. For example, they told people that Trump would replace the U.S. ambassador there months before she was actually recalled to Washington, according to three of the individuals interviewed by the AP. One of the individuals said he was so concerned by the whole affair that he reported it to a U.S. Embassy official in Ukraine months ago. Ukraine, a resource-rich nation that sits on the geographic and symbolic border between Russia and the West, has long been plagued by corruption and government dysfunction, making it a magnet for foreign profiteers. At the center of the Naftogaz plan, according to three individuals familiar with the details, were three such businessmen: two Soviet-born Florida real estate entrepreneurs, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, and an oil magnate from Boca Raton, Florida, named Harry Sargeant III. Parnas and Fruman have made hundreds of thousands of dollars in political donations to Republicans, including $325,000 to a Trump-allied political action committee in 2018. This helped the relatively unknown entrepreneurs gain access to top levels of the Republican Party \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including meetings with Trump at the White House and Mar-a-Lago. The two have also faced lawsuits from disgruntled investors over unpaid debts. During the same period they were pursuing the Naftogaz deal, the two were coordinating with Giuliani to set up meetings with Ukrainian government officials and push for an investigation of the Bidens. Sargeant, his wife and corporate entities tied to the family have donated at least $1.2 million to Republican campaigns and PACs over the last 20 years, including $100,000 in June to the Trump Victory Fund, according to federal and state campaign finance records. He has also served as finance chair of the Florida state GOP, and gave nearly $14,000 to Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failed 2008 presidential campaign. In early March, Fruman, Parnas and Sargeant were touting a plan to replace Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev with another senior executive at the company, Andrew Favorov, according to two individuals who spoke to the AP as well as a memorandum about the meeting that was later submitted to the U.S. Embassy in Kiev. Going back to the Obama administration, the U.S. Energy Department and the State Department have long supported efforts to import American natural gas into Ukraine to reduce the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dependence on Russia. The three approached Favorov with the idea while the Ukrainian executive was attending an energy industry conference in Texas. Parnas and Fruman told him they had flown in from Florida on a private jet to recruit him to be their partner in a new venture to export up to 100 tanker shipments a year of U.S. liquefied gas into Ukraine, where Naftogaz is the largest distributor, according to two people briefed on the details. Sargeant told Favorov that he regularly meets with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and that the gas-sales plan had the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full support, according to the two people who said Favorov recounted the discussion to them. These conversations were recounted to AP by Dale W. Perry, an American who is a former business partner of Favorov. He told AP in an interview that Favorov described the meeting to him soon after it happened and that Favorov perceived it to be a shakedown. Perry, who is no relation to the energy secretary, is the managing partner of Energy Resources of Ukraine, which currently has business agreements to import natural gas and electricity to Ukraine. A second person who spoke on condition of anonymity also confirmed to the AP that Favorov had recounted details of the Houston meeting to him. According to Dale Perry and the other person, Favorov said Parnas told him Trump planned to remove U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and replace her with someone more open to aiding their business interests. Dale Perry told the AP he was so concerned about the efforts to change the management at Naftogaz and to get rid of Yovanovitch that he reported what he had heard to Suriya Jayanti, a State Department foreign service officer stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv who focuses on the energy industry. He also wrote a detailed memo about Favorov\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account, dated April 12, which was shared with another current State Department official. Perry recently provided a copy of the April memo to AP. Jayanti declined to provide comment. Favorov also declined to comment. On March 24, Giuliani and Parnas gathered at the Trump International Hotel in Washington with Healy E. Baumgardner, a former Trump campaign adviser who once served as deputy communications director for Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign and as a communications official during the George W. Bush administration. She is now listed as the CEO of 45 Energy Group, a Houston-based energy company whose website describes it as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgovernment relations, public affairs and business development practice group.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This was a couple of weeks after the Houston meeting with Favorov, the Naftogaz executive. Giuliani, Parnas and Baumgardner were there to make a business pitch involving gas deals in the former Soviet bloc to a potential investor. This time, according to Giuliani, the deals that were discussed involved Uzbekistan, not Ukraine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not pursued a deal in the Ukraine. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about a deal in the Ukraine. I would not do a deal in the Ukraine now, obviously,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Giuliani, reached while attending a playoff baseball game between the New York Yankees and Minnesota Twins. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is absolutely no proof that I did it, because I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During this meeting, Parnas again repeated that Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador in Kyiv, would soon be replaced, according to a person with direct knowledge of the gathering. She was removed two months later. Giuliani, who serves as Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer and has no official role in government, acknowledged Friday that he was among those pushing the president to replace the ambassador, a career diplomat with a history of fighting corruption. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ambassador to Ukraine was replaced,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did play a role in that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Giuliani refused to discuss the details of his business dealings, or whether he helped his associates in their push to forge gas sales contracts with the Ukrainian company. He did describe Sergeant as a friend and referred to Parnas and Fruman as his clients in a tweet in May. As part of their impeachment inquiry, House Democrats have subpoenaed Giuliani for documents and communications related to dozens of people, including Favorov, Parnas, Fruman and Baumgardner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 45 Energy Group. Baumgardner issued a written statement, saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t comment on business discussions, I will say this: this political assault on private business by the Democrats in Congress is complete harassment and an invasion of privacy that should scare the hell out of every American business owner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sargeant did not respond to a voice message left at a number listed for him at an address in Boca Raton. John Dowd, a former Trump attorney who now represents Parnas and Fruman, said it was actually the Naftogaz executives who approached his clients about making a deal. He says they then met with Rick Perry to get the Energy Department on board. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe people from the company solicited my clients because Igor is in the gas business, and they asked them, and they flew to Washington and they solicited,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dowd said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey sat down and talked about it. And then it was presented to Secretary Perry to see if they could get it together. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a shakedown; it was an attempt to do legitimate business that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In May, Rick Perry traveled to Kyiv to serve as the senior U.S. government representative at the inauguration of the county\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new president. In a private meeting with Zelenskiy, Perry pressed the Ukrainian president to fire members of the Naftogaz advisory board. Attendees left the meeting with the impression that Perry wanted to replace the American representative, Amos Hochstein, a former diplomat and energy representative who served in the Obama administration, with someone \u00e2\u0080\u009creputable in Republican circles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to someone who was in the room. A second meeting during the trip, at a Kyiv hotel, included Ukrainian officials and energy sector people. There, Perry made clear that the Trump administration wanted to see the entire Naftogaz supervisory board replaced, according to a person who attended both meetings. Perry again referenced the list of advisers that he had given Zelenskiy, and it was widely interpreted that he wanted Robert Bleyzer, a Ukrainian-American businessman from Texas, to join the newly formed board, the person said. Also on the list was Robert Bensh, another Texan who frequently works in Ukraine, the Energy Department confirmed. Gordon D. Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, then the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s special envoy to Ukraine, were also in the room, according to photographs reviewed by AP. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation, said he was floored by the American requests because the person had always viewed the U.S. government \u00e2\u0080\u009cas having a higher ethical standard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Naftogaz supervisory board is supposed to be selected by the Ukrainian president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cabinet in consultation with international institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the United States and the European Union. It must be approved by the Ukrainian Cabinet. Ukrainian officials perceived Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s push to swap out the board as circumventing that established process, according to the person in the room. U.S. Energy Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said Perry had consistently called for the modernization of Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business and energy sector in an effort to create an environment that will incentivize Western companies to do business there. She said Perry delivered that same message in the May meeting with Zelenskiy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat he did not do is advocate for the business interests of any one individual or company,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hynes said Saturday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is fiction being pushed by those who are disingenuously seeking to advance a nefarious narrative that does not exist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hynes said the Ukrainian government had requested U.S. recommendations to advise the country on energy matters, and Perry provided those recommendations. She confirmed Bleyzer was on the list. Bleyzer, whose company is based in Houston, did not respond on Saturday to a voicemail seeking comment. Bensh also did not respond to a phone message. As a former Texas governor, Perry has always had close ties to the oil and gas industry. He appointed Bleyzer to a two-year term on a state technologies fund board in 2009. The following year, records show Bleyzer donated $20,000 to Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reelection campaign. Zelenskiy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office declined to comment on Saturday. In an interview Friday with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Perry said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cas God as my witness\u00e2\u0080\u009d he never discussed Biden or his son in meetings with Ukrainian or U.S. officials, including Trump or Giuliani. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis has been a very intense, a very focused push to get Ukraine to clean up the corruption,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Perry said in the interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go in good faith and tell a U.S. company, go and invest here, go and be involved if the corruption is ongoing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He did confirm he had had a conversation with Giuliani by phone, but a spokeswoman for the energy secretary declined to say when that call was or whether the two had discussed Naftogaz. ___ Biesecker and Lardner reported from Washington. ___ Follow Associated Press investigative reporters Desmond Butler at http://twitter.com/desmondbutler, Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck, and Richard Lardner at http://twitter.com/rplardner ___ Contact AP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org.",

      "content": " A federal judge has ordered the White House not to destroy records relating to President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interactions with foreign heads of state, some of which have become the focus of a formal impeachment inquiry. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson\u00c2\u00a0issued the order\u00c2\u00a0Thursday to safeguard records of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeetings, phone calls, and other communications with foreign leaders\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as \u00e2\u0080\u009crecords reflecting policies and practices\u00e2\u0080\u009d regarding such record-keeping. The judge also ordered the preservation of \u00e2\u0080\u009call records of efforts by White House or other executive branch officials to \u00e2\u0080\u009creturn, \u00e2\u0080\u0098claw back,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098lock down\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or recall White House records.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A lawsuit against Trump and the Executive Office of the President demanding the records be safeguarded was filed in May, long before the impeachment inquiry, by watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the National Security Archive and the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations. It argued that the White House was ignoring the Presidential Records Act, which requires the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s official records to be preserved. The law, \u00e2\u0080\u009cenacted in the wake of President Nixon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resignation and attempt to seize control of his presidential records, reflects Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s judgment that presidential records are owned by the United States on behalf of the American people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the suit states. The suit was filed after media reports that no records existed for at least five Trump meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u00c2\u00a0and a meeting with Saudi Prince Mohammad bin Salman. A July phone call by Trump to Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president pushing him to launch an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden and his son \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while he was suspending aid to the nation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is now the focus of a House impeachment inquiry. Trump on Thursday also called on China to initiate a probe of the Bidens. The whistleblower complaint that triggered the inquiry alleges that senior White House officials attempted to \u00e2\u0080\u009clock down\u00e2\u0080\u009d records of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone call to keep it hidden. In light of that information, the lawsuit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers requested a temporary restraining order. But Jackson opted not to issue one after government attorneys finally\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cvoluntarily agreed\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a court filing on Wednesday to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpreserve the material.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

The tweet boasted that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doubt about a plot to poison a former Russian spy and his daughter was the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest evidence that no evidence of Russian involvement exists.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The embassy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tweet linked to an article published Sunday in The Guardian reporting that Trump informed former British Prime Minister Theresa May in a tense phone call last year that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe the Russian government was involved in the poisoning\u00c2\u00a0of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury. The newspaper cited a report in The Washington Post that Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009charangued\u00e2\u0080\u009d May about Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contribution to NATO \u00e2\u0080\u0094 then disputed Russian involvement in the murder attempt.

Good luck surviving.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Disaster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d pic.twitter.com/ktyDqsM4lS The White House announced on Sunday that Turkey would soon invade northern Syria, putting the Kurdish fighters \u00e2\u0080\u0095 an ethnic group led by the Syrian Democratic Forces who have been longtime allies with the U.S. campaign against the Islamic State group \u00e2\u0080\u0095 on unsure ground. U.S. troops \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill not support or be involved in the operation\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill no longer be in the immediate area,\u00e2\u0080\u009d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement after a call between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey will take custody\u00c2\u00a0of foreign fighters captured in the U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State held by American-supported Kurdish forces, Grisham added. Turkey sees Kurdish forces as a terrorist insurgency, and has long wanted the U.S. to sever ties with the group. Trump announced in December 2018 that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be withdrawing troops from Syria, but relented after fierce criticism. The announcement led Jim Mattis to resign as defense secretary and then-national security adviser John Bolton to take steps attempting to protect the Kurds. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new decision to abandon the Kurds has already sparked backlash beyond Fox News. A Syria Kurdish official told NBC that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Americans are traitors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have abandoned us to a Turkish massacre. We can no longer fight against ISIS and have to defend ourselves. This could allow ISIS to return to the region,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the official said. Also on \u00e2\u0080\u009cFox & Friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision compromises America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promise to allies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe thing I believe is if you make a commitment and someone is fighting with you, America should keep its word,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCarthy said.

Any captured ISIS fighters are now the responsibility of Turkey, the White House added.

The White House announced on Sunday that it would effectively allow Turkey to invade northern Syria by withdrawing U.S. troops from the region.

      "author": "Emily Peck",
      "content": " Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) announced a plan on Monday that would guarantee workers up to six months of paid family and medical leave, the most generous such policy proposal in the Democratic presidential field. Harris is unveiling her plan, part of what she calls a \u00e2\u0080\u009cchildren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agenda,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as her 2020 campaign is struggling. The proposal is more aspirational than practical, as six months of leave exceeds anything currently under consideration or on offer in the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0095 the only developed country that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guarantee new mothers paid time off. Still, by calling attention to the issue, Harris could help bring paid leave to prominence on the 2020 agenda, from which it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been largely absent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope this is a turning point. I have been deeply disappointed in how little discussion there has been,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vicki Shabo, senior fellow for paid leave policy and strategy at New America, a liberal think tank. Shabo has been frustrated that women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic issues have gotten short shrift during the 2020 campaign so far \u00e2\u0080\u0095 barring a few questions on the pay gap. Perhaps Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agenda will move the needle, Shabo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis might start a domino effect among candidates.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Paid maternity and paternity leave and time off for caregiving are not just women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issues, of course. And as the population ages, these concerns will become even more critical to working Americans. But the 2020 candidates have forgone the conversation on leave to focus on single-payer \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedicare for all\u00e2\u0080\u009d and other health insurance issues \u00e2\u0080\u0095 perhaps forgetting that in order for working Americans to access health care, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need the time off to go to the doctor or recover from medical procedures. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGuaranteeing six months of paid leave will bring us closer to economic justice for workers and ensures newborn children or children who are sick can get the care they need from a parent without thrusting the family into upheaval,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harris said in a statement. Under Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal, workers who make $75,000 or less would receive their full salary while taking time off to deal with a serious health condition; caring for an infant or newly adopted child; addressing military caregiving and leave; or addressing domestic violence, harassment, sexual assault or stalking. The leave could be taken as a block of time or intermittently, as needs arise. Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 policy would also guarantee job protections to workers and offer support to small businesses that must give workers time off. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d pay for the leave with a payroll tax shared by employers and employees, as well as by levying penalties on companies that fail to close their pay gaps (an earlier Harris proposal). All the Democrats vying for the presidential nomination who are members of Congress have co-sponsored the Family Act, a bill that would give workers 12 weeks of paid time off. The Family Act has been kicking around for the past few years; Harris is the first Democrat in the race to go significantly beyond it. Her proposal was influenced by paid leave policies in a handful of states that have already learned a critical lesson about wage replacement. For example, California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paid leave law, in effect for more than a decade, initially only offered 55% wage replacement. That made it next to impossible for low-income workers to take time off. The state has since increased wage replacement. The lesson: If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give low-wage workers most of their income, they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the time off. Six months of leave in the United States is still pretty much unheard of, even though research has found it to be a good amount of time for moms and babies to be home together or for children to be home with a loving caregiver. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the first time we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a major presidential candidate, but also a U.S. Senator, talk about a family leave policy that is supported by medical evidence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Katie Bethell, executive director at Paid Leave for the United States, an advocacy group. The American Pediatric Association, Bethell noted, recommends six months of leave. Bethell said her group has spoken to all the Democratic contenders and offered Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 team help in crafting its policy. Polling they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done shows that paid family leave is an important issue to Democratic voters \u00e2\u0080\u0095 particularly Black and Hispanic voters. Putting a paid leave policy under the umbrella of a children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agenda is significant, Bethell said. Half of families with children at home use paid leave for reasons beyond taking care of new babies, according to Bethell. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using it to take care of seriously ill kids or for income replacement when a parent is seriously ill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Harris also uses an inclusive definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cfamily member\u00e2\u0080\u009d that goes beyond blood relatives \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a critical issue for LGBTQ workers in particular. The children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agenda also includes a pitch to expand access to high-quality preschool, an effort to cut child poverty and a proposal to create a federal Bureau of Children and Family Justice.",

The Kurds lead the Syrian Democratic Forces, the main ally to the U.S. in fighting the self-described Islamic State in Syria. Turkey has long wanted the U.S. to end its support for the Kurds, an ethnic group the Turkish government views as terrorists. The White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement Sunday to allow Turkey to invade northern Syria startled some members of Congress, who warned such a move could lead to a genocide of the Kurds and allow ISIS to creep back into the region.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy urged the U.S. to \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep its word\u00e2\u0080\u009d with its foreign allies during an appearance Monday on \u00e2\u0080\u009cFox & Friends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a terribly unwise decision by the President to abandon our Kurdish allies, who have been our major partner in the fight against the Islamic State,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sen.

Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan includes closing a loophole that allows federal judges to escape investigations for misconduct when they resign from office or are elevated to the Supreme Court \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a loophole that Warren has\u00c2\u00a0railed against in the past. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy plan extends the authority of the Judicial Conference to former judges so that individuals under investigation cannot simply resign from the bench to avoid accountability,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis provision would allow the judiciary to reopen the investigations into Alex Kozinski,\u00c2\u00a0Maryanne Trump-Barry,\u00c2\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh, and any other judge who benefited from this loophole.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kozinski was a judge on the federal 9th Circuit accused in 2017 by at least 15 law clerks of sexual misconduct. But, as Warren noted, the investigation into Kozinski\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior was dropped when he retired. Trump-Barry, President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister, resigned as a federal appellate judge in April, ending a probe into whether she violated judicial conduct rules by participating in the Trump family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alleged tax fraud schemes. When Kavanaugh rose to the Supreme Court, sexual assault and perjury complaints against him were dismissed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe basic premise of our legal system is that every person is treated equally in the eyes of the law \u00e2\u0080\u0095 including judges,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren said on Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur judiciary only functions properly when it lives up to this promise, and it risks eroding its legitimacy when the American people lose faith that judges are ethical and fair-minded.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren also unveiled several proposals she hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mentioned publicly before. They include\u00c2\u00a0prohibiting judges from deciding for themselves whether they should recuse themselves from a case due to conflict of interest;\u00c2\u00a0requiring Supreme Court justices to give written explanations of their decisions when a party asks for a recusal; and\u00c2\u00a0giving strong disciplinary tools to judicial ethics watchdogs, such as allowing them to take away nonvested pension benefits from judges. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan also proposes extending the Code of Conduct for United States Judges to the Supreme Court, which is currently not covered by such guidelines. Explaining the need for this provision, Warren cited the 83 ethics complaints\u00c2\u00a0lodged against Kavanaugh that were dismissed upon his confirmation to the Supreme Court, as well as the lack of action after Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u00c2\u00a0failed to disclose payments\u00c2\u00a0his wife received from a conservative judicial activist group. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause the Supreme Court is not covered by a Code of Conduct, no procedure exists to file new complaints\u00e2\u0080\u009d against Kavanaugh, Warren said. She added that\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cquestions are often raised about the behavior of Supreme Court Justices, such as Justice Thomas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 13 years of financial disclosures that failed to list $690,000 in payments to his wife from the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing judicial activist group \u00e2\u0080\u0095 but these actions are beyond the scope of current rules.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Such lack of oversight, Warren said, has gone on for long enough. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese changes will not only allow us to ensure accountability for bad actors, including reopening inquiries into the conduct of offenders like Brett Kavanaugh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will also hold the vast majority of judges who act in good faith to the highest ethical standards, and in the process, begin to restore accountability and trust in a fair and impartial federal judiciary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan comes almost exactly a year after the Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, following explosive allegations that he sexually assaulted at least three women when he was younger.",

      "content": "MANCHESTER, N.H. \u00e2\u0080\u0095 It is early September, and Cory Booker is telling me he is done with stunts. When the New Jersey senator and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate was a council member and then mayor of Newark, one of his major goals was to bring attention to the problems of his poor, majority-minority 277,000-person city \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a feat he often excelled at with his outsize charisma and his savvy use of social media. Booker once held a hunger strike in the courtyard of a housing project to protest gang violence. He started a feud with Conan O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien after the late night host joked about wanting to flee Newark. He was one of the first Democrats ever to complete the food stamp challenge. But now, in a campaign-rented recreational vehicle departing the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention and heading north toward the Maine border, Booker says he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to turn himself into a shiny object for the benefit of the media. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I became mayor of a city that everybody was trying to get away from, or when I was trying to beat a machine, getting attention was what I needed to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Booker says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI got very good at getting this small city \u00e2\u0080\u0095 maybe bigger than some cities that other people are mayors of \u00e2\u0080\u0095 my job was to get resources and attention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen I became a senator, my first year, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do interviews, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk in caucus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continues. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to draw attention to myself as a United States senator. What I wanted to do was to pass criminal justice reform, work across the aisle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Booker campaign is seemingly pursuing the same heads-down approach, doing everything you are supposed to do to win a presidential nomination: barnstorming through Iowa and New Hampshire; building up ground games to rival those of the leading candidates; generating big \u00e2\u0080\u0095 if not game-changing \u00e2\u0080\u0095 moments at debates; and releasing policy papers that earned plaudits from wonks. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s garnered more endorsements from state legislators than any other candidate has. The other campaigns are watching for his breakout moment. Sure, the Booker team members are frustrated with his place in the polls. But they are, perhaps surprisingly, Zen about the future of the race and their man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place in it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just have to keep raising money, and I will be the nominee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Booker says, confident enough that he openly muses about what kind of general election campaign he would run.\u00c2\u00a0(He wants to go to states you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect Democrats to campaign in during the general, like South Carolina and West Virginia.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cOrganize like hell and hope you get hot at the end,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is how his campaign manager Addisu Demissie described the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategy in a conference call with reporters in the spring. Booker recently expressed it in emoji form: turtle emoji, greater-than sign, rabbit emoji. Just two weeks later, that tone radically changed: The Booker campaign announced it needed to raise $1.7 million in 10 days to give him a hope to compete. Instead of quietly making this appeal to top donors, the campaign put their desperation on full blast. The team leaked a memo from Demissie to NBC News, then held a press conference call to discuss it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not able to build the campaign organization, which means raise the money that we need to win the nomination, Cory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to continue running and consuming resources that are better used on focusing on beating Donald Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Demissie told the reporters on the call. The alarmist tone of the note immediately generated skepticism among both reporters and the other campaigns, leading them to believe it was a carefully orchestrated political stunt to generate attention and dollars from a candidate that had no real intention of quitting. (Demissie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memo included a preemptive rebuttal of this argument, noting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press.\u00e2\u0080\u009d) In the end, Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign succeeded. It raised $1.7 million in the final 10 days, the most successful 10-day period of his campaign to date, and hit more than $6 million in the quarter overall. Booker also qualified for the next two presidential debates. Stunt or not, the episode raised a larger question: Just how did Cory Booker find himself in this position in the first place? ***** Booker has been receiving presidential hype since before he even entered the Senate, when he dazzled the national press with heroic anecdotes from his term as mayor: He ran into a burning building to save a constituent and, guided by Twitter, went around shoveling the sidewalks and driveways of elderly residents after snowstorms. In 2012, the Obama campaign regularly deployed him as a surrogate. The Clinton team did the same in 2016, and strongly considered him for vice president, to the point where Clinton-Booker placards had been printed. In the summer of 2018, The New York Times identified him \u00e2\u0080\u0095 along with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u00e2\u0080\u0095 as one of the five leading contenders for the Democratic nomination. Suffice it to say, the first eight months of the Booker campaign have fallen short of those expectations. Voters in the early states, ticking off which candidates they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re considering, routinely list Booker as the second or third choice, often behind Warren or Biden. But, if you look at the horse race numbers from those same polls, only between one out of every 100 and one out of every 20 voters considers him their top choice. Even in the areas where he theoretically should excel \u00e2\u0080\u0095 with black voters, with young people \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Booker polls, at best, in the high single digits. Jim Demers, a former New Hampshire state legislator who is now a top Booker adviser \u00e2\u0080\u0095 his duties include driving the aforementioned RV \u00e2\u0080\u0095 said Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign at the moment resembles former President Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the same point in 2007. (Demers would know, since he was Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s New Hampshire campaign chair.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe size of the field has made it very difficult to process the candidates beyond the two or three who had the highest name recognition right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Demers said, dismissing candidates who have spiked in the polls before Labor Day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe real voters start paying attention. This is movement time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Demers is right: With just a few debates left, the number of chances to make a shock-and-awe impression to move the polls is dwindling, and the top three candidates \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Biden, Warren and Sanders \u00e2\u0080\u0095 have displayed vulnerabilities aplenty without another candidate rising to challenge them. If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement time, then time is running out for Booker to be more than everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second or third choice. ***** That morning in September, Booker strolls onto the stage at Southern New Hampshire University at 10 a.m. Biden spoke before him and failed to rouse the still-drowsy crowd. Booker begins with a version of his stump speech, which opens with the story of how his family, turned away from buying homes in a suburb of Newark because they were Black, was eventually able to purchase one with the help of white activists inspired by the civil rights movement. About three minutes into the speech, Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lines start generating audible cheers from the crowd. Six minutes in, Booker delivers one of his favorite lines \u00e2\u0080\u0095 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe gotta beat Donald Trump. But beating Donald Trump is the floor. It is not the ceiling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and the applause and cheers are loud enough that he has to pause before continuing. By the 10-minute mark, Booker has the crowd echoing another one of his signature lines \u00e2\u0080\u0095 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will rise\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0095 in a call-and-response pattern. He leaves to a standing ovation. In a different race, one where there weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t more than a dozen candidates still running, the post-event headlines might have focused on Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong performance. But Booker isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t running in that race. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running in the race where Warren got a standing ovation that lasted more than two minutes before she even said a word, and where her picture was splashed across the top of the New Hampshire Union Leader the next morning. After his speech, a pair of cable news interviews and a gaggle with reporters who peppered him with questions about his low standing in the polls \u00e2\u0080\u0095 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do not want to win the summer news cycle, we want to win the election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Booker is off to a volunteer thank-you event at a pub across the street from the arena. Outside, he greets a group of volunteers from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, one of whom is wearing a cow outfit and holding a sign declaring: \u00e2\u0080\u009cClimate change cow says: Go vegan or we all die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy vegan people!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he calls out, before taking a selfie with the group. (While Booker is a vegan, the PETA group members say they have been attending events with all the candidates to talk to voters about how a vegan diet can help the environment.) Inside is a gathering of relatively rare creatures in Democratic politics: Booker loyalists. While Warren, Biden, Harris, Sanders and even the unorthodox entrepreneur Andrew Yang have their legions of devoted online followers, Booker does not. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a puzzling development for a man who came to national attention, in no small part, because of his ability to grab attention on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know anybody who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like Cory Booker,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one Democratic operative, requesting anonymity to speak candidly about one of the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brightest lights. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut he isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first or second choice. There are only so many voters of so many persuasions, and his ability to draw those voters is limited when he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a core constituency of his own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, during its scramble to raise the self-imposed requirement of $1.7 million, seemed to acknowledge his difficulty building a uniquely loyal constituency. Many of its email pleas focused not on helping Booker win but simply on keeping him in the race.\u00c2\u00a0And many of the big names who endorsed keeping Booker in the race \u00e2\u0080\u0093 former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, Iowa Auditor Rob Sand and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have not actually endorsed his candidacy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be a loss for not only our party but for our country if someone like him was shut out of this race because he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t raise enough money to compete,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Demissie wrote in one email. Booker asked for donations even \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t settled on a candidate but you think I bring an important perspective to this campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Talking to the assembled Booker supporters, there is no uniform reason for their support: Some like his emphasis on combating gun violence, others his promise to unify the country, another says he could replicate Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s path to victory in 2008. But they all have one thing in common: They have met Booker in person. The Booker campaign hopes a lot more voters can do the same. During one trip to the Hawkeye State in early June, Booker stopped in Keokuk, Iowa, an 11,000-person city on the Mississippi River in the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far southeastern corner, where he gathered 50 people at a coffee shop, and then hung around to take selfies, record videos for friends of attendees who couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make the event, listen to the whispered concerns of seniors and eventually leave with a piece of coffee cake he would give to a staffer. (The frosting wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vegan.) He then spent 40 minutes at a house in nearby Burlington, where a group of less than a dozen women discussed the closure of a Planned Parenthood in the city. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEach one of the people here is going to tell 20 people about what happened,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tom Courtney, a former Iowa state senator who hosted the event. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Iowa, this is what it takes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Courtney continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBernie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it. Joe hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done it so far. Right now, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re winning on name recognition. But once the rubber hits the road, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to cut it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Booker is betting a lot on Iowa. Even Demers acknowledged one of the two candidates from New England \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Sanders or Warren \u00e2\u0080\u0095 is more likely than not to win the New Hampshire primary. That leaves Iowa as Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only major chance to make an impact before African American voters \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a key part of his theoretical winning coalition \u00e2\u0080\u0095 begin voting in larger numbers in Nevada and then South Carolina. Booker said he personally considers his team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Iowa operation \u00e2\u0080\u0095 he has 50 paid employees in the state \u00e2\u0080\u0095 to be as strong as any campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, save Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Ditto with his team in New Hampshire, where he has 30 staffers on the ground. Back in Manchester, Booker makes his way through the crowd, feeling the love, grabbing people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phones to quickly snap a selfie. (Booker always takes the selfies himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can always take the picture quicker than they can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the volume down button on iPhones is a picture taker.\u00e2\u0080\u009d) Booker delivers a quick speech to the gathered supporters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are building this campaign brick by brick by brick!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaims. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to make sure the next president of the United States is bald!\u00e2\u0080\u009d ***** Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next stop in Manchester is at Brookside Congregational, part of the liberal-leaning United Church of Christ, with a Black Lives Matter sign out front and a crowd of about 30 inside. Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here for a question-and-answer session sponsored by the Granite State Organizing Project, which is focused on criminal justice reform, affordable housing and immigration. The questions start coming, and they are coming from the left end of the political spectrum. Throughout the campaign, Booker has announced his occasional \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrustration\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the primary conversation. He first shared it onstage at an event with Al Sharpton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Action Network and has repeated it several times since. I asked Booker to explain what he meant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI get people asking me about Greenland!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Booker said, referring to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desire to purchase the North Atlantic island. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat same week, Title X funding was being cut. Nobody asked me about that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt frustrates me, as the guy who lives in the inner city, when people ask \u00e2\u0080\u0095 almost as a litmus test \u00e2\u0080\u0095 first, it was \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is Donald Trump a racist?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then, it was \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is he a white supremacist?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the issue. The issue is we have a problem with white supremacy in this country. And yeah, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem. But the bigger problem is white supremacy in this country. And what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your plan for that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annoyance, at times, can seem a little convenient. He entered the race under fire from the left because of his support for charter schools, his past embrace of technology companies and his ties to his home state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerful pharmaceutical industry. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the newer debates that seem to get under his skin. He bristles when he thinks progressives are getting ahead of the country, and complicating both campaigning and governance. Questions about whether prisoners should be allowed to vote annoy him, he has said, because the focus should be on getting people out of prison in the first place. The overall effect is that Booker is in a bit of a never-never land, ideologically. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assembled a liberal voting record in the Senate, but declines to engage in either an out-and-out race to match Sanders on the left or the name-and-shame tactics Warren employs against Facebook and other modern-day malefactors of great wealth. But he also declines to engage in the hippie-punching many of the moderate candidates frequently deploy \u00e2\u0080\u0095 think Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criticisms of \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedicare for All,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attacks on proposals to wipe away student debt. At the church, the litmus test question is about defunding Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Booker doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t directly engage, turning down the opportunity to provide a quick sound bite that would please activists and the media. Instead, he turns in a 15-minute answer that touches on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeep hypocrisy\u00e2\u0080\u009d of some devout Americans, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe radical work of love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cruelty to animals, environmental racism and the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and ultimately the fear Latinos living in Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inner-city neighborhood in Newark feel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the issues we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about are deeply interrelated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Booker says. The crowd is nodding, listening intently. But just a few minutes later, Booker has the once-somber crowd in stitches. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recounting the story of his clash with O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien, noting he once banned the late night host from Newark Liberty International Airport, and their faux-feud ended with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton forcing them to negotiate a truce. The abrupt switch from wonky and serious to gut-busting points to another critique of Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign frequently tossed around in D.C. circles: that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoofy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Booker has at times embraced this, giving interviews about his love of Star Trek and making a surprise appearance at Comic-Con. But some operatives think it undercuts Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more serious moments. It, along with Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general love of hope-and-change-and-love-and-togetherness rhetoric, presents another challenge the Booker team is striving to overcome. Booker routinely tells audiences to watch \u00e2\u0080\u009cStreet Fight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Oscar-nominated documentary depicting his first rough-and-tumble campaign against then-Newark Mayor Sharpe James, to get a taste of how he would handle a campaign against Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a guy that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really good at pulling people together for a common cause,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Booker says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand my ground. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a kumbaya guy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But even as Booker tells voters to turn on Netflix and watch an 83-minute-long testament to his toughness, he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but sprinkle in a joke. He typically notes \u00e2\u0080\u009cStreet Fight\u00e2\u0080\u009d lost the Academy Award for Best Documentary that year to \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarch of the Penguins.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cPenguins aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even that cute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he tells audiences, in another line that usually wins laughs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m cuter than a penguin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ***** Last Tuesday morning, the Booker campaign held a conference call to announce it had\u00c2\u00a0raised $6 million, with a third of that coming after their desperate ask for more cash. With that funding it was able to hire 40 more staffers, in the early states and at its headquarters in Newark. Demissie insisted again that most voters were undecided. After the success of their big fundraising ask and in the service of \u00e2\u0080\u009cradical transparency\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a radical transparency that did not extend to releasing the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s average donation size or cash-on-hand number \u00e2\u0080\u0095 he said they were setting a $3 million fundraising goal for the month of October. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in the last 10 days that voters want Cory to be one of their choices,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Demissie said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you tell people the truth, and you let them know what you need, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come to your aide, because they want Cory to be in this race until the end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whether they want him to win is an entirely different matter.",

      "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 A federal judge rejected President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenge to the release of his tax returns for a New York state criminal probe, saying on Monday that he could not grant such a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccategorical and limitless assertion of presidential immunity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers notified the judge that they will immediately appeal the ruling. Judge Victor Marrero called Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim of a broad immunity \u00e2\u0080\u009cextraordinary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the court reads it, presidential immunity would stretch to cover every phase of criminal proceedings, including investigations, grand jury proceedings and subpoenas, indictment, prosecution, arrest, trial, conviction, and incarceration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marrero wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat constitutional protection presumably would encompass any conduct, at any time, in any forum, whether federal or state, and whether the President acted alone or in concert with other individuals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The judge said he \u00e2\u0080\u009ccannot endorse such a categorical and limitless assertion of presidential immunity from judicial process as being countenanced by the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitutional plan, especially in the light of the fundamental concerns over excessive arrogation of power that animated the Constitution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delicate structure and its calibrated balance of authority among the three branches of the national government, as well as between the federal and state authorities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lawyers did not immediately respond to email requests for comment in responce to the ruling. The returns had been sought by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. His office is investigating the Trump Organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement in buying the silence of two women who claimed to have had affairs with the president. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers have said the investigation is politically motivated and that the quest for his tax records should be stopped because he is immune from any criminal probe as long as he is president. Last week, Justice Department lawyers in Washington urged Marrero to delay deciding the issue. Vance began his probe after federal prosecutors in Manhattan completed their investigation into payments that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, arranged to be paid to porn actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal to keep them silent during the presidential race. The Trump Organization later reimbursed Cohen. Cohen is serving a three-year prison sentence.",

She also wondered if the move was spurred by a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwag the dog\u00e2\u0080\u009d impulse to distract attention from the impeachment inquiry into Trump. Although some GOP leaders have been silent on the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new policy, some of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staunchest backers, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), are publicly urging Trump to reconsider.

      "content": " On a warm October morning in 2018, busloads of women converged on Capitol Hill and made their way to Sen. Susan Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 office. The Maine Republican was ostensibly on the fence about whether to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in light of several sexual misconduct allegations against him. Dozens of sexual assault survivors and their allies lingered outside Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 door, hoping for a chance to explain why supporting Kavanaugh would be a monumental mistake. But Collins was busy that day, her staff said, poring through the FBI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s limited investigation into the accusations against him. The next day, Collins delivered a marathon speech from the Senate floor announcing she would vote for Kavanaugh, cementing a spot on the bench for President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second Supreme Court nominee. For some of her constituents, Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 vote was an awakening. The most senior Republican woman in the Senate, a self-proclaimed pro-choice moderate, had just sung the praises of an accused sexual predator whose anti-abortion views could jeopardize the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Others \u00e2\u0080\u0095 those more familiar with Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 record\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0were less surprised: The four-term senator often hid behind her \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoderate\u00e2\u0080\u009d cloak, but rarely broke with the Republican Party on votes where she could make a difference. In the end, Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 support for Kavanaugh appeared to spark a nearly universal sentiment among Mainers who opposed his confirmation, whether they were longtime political activists or speaking out for the first time: betrayal. A year later, that feeling continues to enrage and mobilize many Maine voters. Though Collins hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet formally announced her reelection campaign, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amassed several Democratic challengers, including Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon; Betsy Sweet, a women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights advocate and a former Maine gubernatorial candidate; and attorney Bre Kidman. Kidman, who uses the pronouns them and they, was one of the sexual assault survivors from Maine who traveled hundreds of miles to Washington last year in an attempt to persuade Collins not to vote for Kavanaugh. On the one-year anniversary of his confirmation, Kidman returned to Washington, where they joined hundreds of people outside the Supreme Court protesting Kavanaugh, including Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), who introduced a resolution last month calling for his impeachment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just about sexual assault. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just about a political move,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kidman told HuffPost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about her not listening to us and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think anyone is going to let her forget it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cLast year, I was nervous to beg my senator to do the right thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd this year, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m coming for her job and nerves be damned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hundreds of Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 critics protested in Washington and across Maine on Sunday. In Bar Harbor, more than a dozen women staged a die-in for 43 minutes \u00e2\u0080\u0095 the length of Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Kavanaugh speech on the Senate floor \u00e2\u0080\u0095\u00c2\u00a0 in one of Maine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most scenic parks, eliciting encouragement from tourists and local passersby. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople who weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really active in the last election are ready to go knock on doors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gail Leiser, a member of Indivisible MDI, a local chapter of the progressive movement that organized the demonstration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have that sense of betrayal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Collins has \u00e2\u0080\u009calways been a wolf in sheep\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always presented as a moderate, but would always toe the party line. A lot of people couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that. But a lot of people have been awakened. What she says and what she does are two different things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Additional protests unfolded across Maine on Sunday, from one outside Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 house in Bangor, to one 130 miles southwest at Portland City Hall. Dini Merz, a co-founder of the progressive political action committee Mainers for Accountable Leadership,\u00c2\u00a0spoke at the Portland event. She came out as a sexual assault survivor a year ago while urging Collins to vote \u00e2\u0080\u009cno\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Kavanaugh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cElection after election, she has said she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pro-choice, that she believes in the right of women to have integrity over their own body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Merz told HuffPost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet she was the pivotal vote in putting onto the Supreme Court someone with a known history of being restrictive of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bodies. Everything he does on that court that confirms that is an albatross around her neck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Within weeks of Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 vote for Kavanaugh, a crowdfunding campaign raised millions of dollars toward whoever would become Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Democratic challenger in 2020. Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 vote also proved lucrative for herself; she raised more money that quarter than any other fundraising period of her career, though the vast majority came from out-of-state. In the year since Kavanaugh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confirmation, several states have passed sweeping anti-abortion laws. Some of these Republican-led states hope the restrictive laws will force the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade, which effectively made abortion legal nationwide. The Supreme Court announced Friday it would hear an abortion case this term \u00e2\u0080\u0095 its first since the retirement of swing justice Anthony Kennedy last year. The case has stoked fears among women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights advocates that their reproductive rights are on the chopping block. Still, Collins \u00e2\u0080\u0095 whose office did not respond to a request for comment \u00e2\u0080\u0095 has said she has no regrets over her vote to confirm Kavanaugh. In fact, she appears to have really embraced it despite the majority of her constituents having opposed it at the time. She sent out mailers accusing \u00e2\u0080\u009cfar left extremists\u00e2\u0080\u009d of attacking her over her vote, and attended a fundraiser in California where she was hailed the \u00e2\u0080\u009chero of the Kavanaugh confirmation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Monday, Sweet, one of Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Democratic challengers in the 2020 race, delivered a petition to Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Portland office with over 1,200 signatures demanding she push for the FBI to reopen its investigation into Kavanaugh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat Susan Collins did is just another slap in the face to women who feel they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believed or taken seriously,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told HuffPost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forgotten. ... This is still so raw for them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abandonment of one of the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 strongest allies in the fight against Islamic State terrorists also happens to reward the authoritarian ruler of Turkey, where the U.S. president personally profits from the Trump Towers in Istanbul. It is not known whether the residential and commercial complex has ever come up in the various private conversations between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan since Trump took office. Seven years ago, Erdogan, then the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prime minister, attended the grand opening of the twin skyscraper project, and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elder daughter Ivanka praised him for doing so. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you Prime Minister Erdogan for joining us yesterday to celebrate the launch of #TrumpTowers Istanbul!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ivanka Trump, now a top White House aide, wrote on April 12, 2012. The White House announced late Sunday night, without consulting U.S. allies in Europe or members of Congress, that Trump had agreed in a phone call with Erdogan to let Turkey occupy a strip of northern Syria, which is currently controlled by ethnic Kurds.\u00c2\u00a0The Kurds, who in recent years have proven to be the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 most effective allies in the fight against ISIS terrorists, have a centuries-old dispute with Turkey over their right to self-rule. Critics of the president said the announcement was exactly the sort of problem they have been highlighting since Trump announced his candidacy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve warned for years that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to hold onto his business empire, particularly the properties in places like Turkey, would one day lead to a national security decision shrouded by his conflicts of interest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jordan Libowitz, communications director for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Trump promised during his campaign that he would separate himself from his family business, which holds licensing deals with Trump-branded hotels, golf courses and condominiums all over the world. He reneged on that pledge and continues to profit from the Trump Organization, the holding company that owns the various elements in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portfolio. A financial disclosure that Trump filed in May claims he earned between $100,001 and $1 million from the Istanbul project in the past year, the same range he claimed for the previous year. In a June 2017 filing, Trump claimed he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d earned between $1 million and $5 million from the project in the preceding 12 months. Exactly how much income the Istanbul project brings him, and how much of a tax write-off it generates, cannot be determined because Trump has refused to make his tax returns public, breaking with four decades of post-Watergate precedent. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Monday that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision had nothing to do with the Trump Towers Istanbul building complex. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Whether the White House press office can reliably represent Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statements or views, however, is unclear. On Aug. 15, for example, Grisham described as \u00e2\u0080\u009cinaccurate\u00e2\u0080\u009d a report that Trump was encouraging Israel to prohibit Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar, of Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib, of Michigan, from entering that country. Within an hour, Trump tweeted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep.Tlaib to visit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Previously, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s press office had denied that Trump knew about his former lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s payment to a porn star to buy her silence about an affair she said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had with her. In fact, Trump had conspired with Michael Cohen to make the $130,000 payment, and then wrote checks from the White House to repay him. The White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision on Turkey this week has been criticized by the Kurds, by human rights groups and by Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Apart from the Istanbul project, Libowitz said Turkish officials, including the trade minister, the defense minister and the ambassador to the United States, have made 14 separate visits to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel a few blocks from the White House since his inauguration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe unfortunately have to ask how much he was influenced in this decision by his personal profits from Turkey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Libowitz said. Robert Weissman, president of the liberal group Public Citizen, said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible to know whether Trump was guided primarily by his personal interest in his Istanbul project \u00e2\u0080\u0095 or, alternatively, by pressure from Erdogan based on keeping secret details about the murder of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed by Saudi Arabian government assassins in Istanbul last year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut a potential slaughter is in the making, and the sad truth is that it may be due in substantial part to Trump wanting to protect his licensing fees,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Weissman said.",

Slamming the decision, Robertson said he is \u00e2\u0080\u009cabsolutely appalled that the United States is going to betray\u00e2\u0080\u009d the fighters, who have partnered with the Syrian Democratic Forces in the battle against the self-described Islamic State. Continuing, Robertson invoked the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in Turkey allegedly at the behest of Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe President, who allowed Khashoggi to be cut in pieces without any repercussions whatsoever, is now allowing the Christians and the Kurds to be massacred by the Turks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Robertson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I believe \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and I want to say this with great solemnity \u00e2\u0080\u0095 the president of the United States is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Robertson, who initially showed little concern for Khashoggi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death in relation to U.S.-Saudi relations, telling his audience that \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blow up an international alliance over one person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d has also been a known defender of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s since before he was elected. Robertson and CBN have scored a handful of interviews\u00c2\u00a0with Trump, giving the network a level of access not afforded to most media outlets, as the president often just speaks via Twitter and occasionally on Fox News. Through CBN, Trump has no doubt been able to reach evangelical voters within his base. At times, Robertson has appeared to address these supporters, too, even attempting to explain away Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAccess Hollywood\u00e2\u0080\u009d tape scandal when, just a month before Election Day, audio emerged of Trump bragging about groping women. Instead of unequivocally condemning the remarks, Robertson praised Trump as being \u00e2\u0080\u009clike the phoenix\u00e2\u0080\u009d who would rise from the blow dealt to his campaign. But for Robertson, who is known for spreading hateful views including homophobia and Islamophobia on-air, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stance on Syria crossed a line. The televangelist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks add to the outcry from a growing list of conservatives and foreign policy experts who have expressed shock\u00c2\u00a0at the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement, warning it spells danger for both the U.S. and the Kurds.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 As House Democrats fire off more subpoenas, the White House is finalizing a high-stakes strategy to counter the impeachment threat to President Donald Trump: Stall. Obfuscate. Attack. Repeat. Trump aides are honing their approach after two weeks of what allies have described as a listless and unfocused response to the impeachment probe. One expected step is a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejecting the inquiry because Democrats haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t held a vote on the matter and moving to all but cease cooperation with Capitol Hill on key oversight matters. The strategy risks further provoking Democrats in the impeachment probe, setting up court challenges and the potential for lawmakers to draw up an article of impeachment accusing Trump of obstructing their investigations. But as lawmakers seek to amass ammunition to be used in an impeachment trial, the White House increasingly believes all-out warfare is its best course of action. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat they did to this country is unthinkable. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lucky that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the president. A lot of people said very few people could handle it. I sort of thrive on it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said Monday at the White House. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t impeach a president for doing a great job. This is a scam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d House Democrats, for their part, issued a new round of subpoenas on Monday, this time to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and acting White House budget director Russell Vought. Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office also released an open letter signed by 90 former national security officials who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, voicing support for the whistleblower who raised concerns about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate political foe Joe Biden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA responsible whistleblower makes all Americans safer by ensuring that serious wrongdoing can be investigated and addressed, thus advancing the cause of national security to which we have devoted our careers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view of the matters discussed in the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint, all Americans should be united in demanding that all branches of our government and all outlets of our media protect this whistleblower and his or her identity. Simply put, he or she has done what our law demands; now he or she deserves our protection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees are investigating Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions pressing Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, potentially interfering in the 2020 election. The former vice president, for his part, has accused Trump of \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump also withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance to Ukraine. The White House has struggled to communicate its message beyond Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s angry public proclamations and an endless stream of tweets. Indeed, top officials were absent from the Sunday talk shows, and the sole White House official to appear in public on Monday dodged questions on the inquiry. Asked whether he believed the president was joking or in any way not serious when he suggested publicly that China should investigate the Bidens, Larry Kudlow, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top economic adviser, responded: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t honestly know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump and his team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial strategy had been to try to undermine the credibility of the intelligence community whistleblower who first raised questions about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct with Ukraine, just as they tried to undercut special counsel Robert Mueller and his team. They stressed that the whistleblower had only second- or third-hand information and alleged that the person misrepresented the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts. But now a second whistleblower has come forward to corroborate the information, and a cache of text messages echoes the concerns that have been laid out. As the impeachment inquiry ramps up, the White House plans to reprise its past response to congressional oversight: open scorn. The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aides have ignored document requests and subpoenas, invoked executive privilege \u00e2\u0080\u0094 going so far as to argue that the privilege extends to informal presidential advisers who have never held White House jobs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and all but dared Democrats to hold them in contempt. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blew a Friday deadline for complying with a subpoena. But he said over the weekend that the State Department had sent a letter to Congress as its initial response to the request. He also indicated a new willingness to comply, saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll obviously do all the things that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re required to do by law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The letter to Pelosi has been delayed as aides work to finalize legislative and communications plans to go along with the legal strategy. At the same time, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, which has reported a fundraising surge since the impeachment inquiry, held a curiously timed briefing call with reporters Monday to trumpet its efforts to overhaul the delegate selection process to ensure there is no drama at the Republican National Convention. Trump campaign officials said the effort had nothing to do with concerns about fending off a primary challenge. ___ Follow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj , Miller at https://twitter.com/zekejmiller and Lemire at https://twitter.com/JonLemire",

Among the protocols Democrats are considering to protect the anonymous intelligence official include having the whistleblower testify remotely with an obscured appearance and voice, three unnamed officials familiar with the discussions told The Washington Post on Monday. Other potential steps, according to the Post, include having the whistleblower testify behind a partition or testify via audio only. HuffPost could not independently confirm the considerations. The alleged discussions represent a growing divide and lack of trust between parties in the House as the chamber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Foreign Affairs, Oversight and Intelligence committees investigate Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son while the president withheld nearly $400 million in approved U.S. military aid to the country. The committee investigations are part of the impeachment inquiry, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Sept. 24 after reports surfaced of the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint and\u00c2\u00a0a summary of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was released by the White House that corroborated the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report. The Post\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report about potential steps to mask the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity comes a day after 90 former national security officials who served under both Democratic and Republican presidents signed an open letter defending the whistleblower and stressing the necessity of protecting the individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view of the matters discussed in the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint, all Americans should be united in demanding that all branches of our government and all outlets of our media protect this whistleblower and his or her identity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter stated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSimply put, he or she has done what our law demands; now he or she deserves our protection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorneys have also voiced concern for their client\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety, specifically after Trump falsely accused the individual of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctreason\u00e2\u0080\u009d despite the whistleblower going through the appropriate channels to relay concerns. The president made veiled threats that the whistleblower should be \u00e2\u0080\u009cdealt with\u00e2\u0080\u009d in violent ways and has repeatedly demanded to meet the individual and find out the person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, according to audio reported by the Los Angeles Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican allies in Congress and conservative media have joined the president in dismissing the whistleblower, accusing the individual of being politically biased. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Washington speak for, \u00e2\u0080\u0098They were out to get the President,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d tweeted Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee. As part of their investigation, House Democrats also issued subpoenas on Monday to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and acting White House budget director Russell Vought. The Pentagon and the Office of Management and Budget have until Oct. 15 to comply. The House has already sent out several other subpoenas, including to the White House, Vice President Mike Pence,\u00c2\u00a0Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Pompeo missed the Friday deadline for complying with his subpoena\u00c2\u00a0but said over the weekend that the State Department had sent a letter to Congress in response to the request. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which is helping to lead the impeachment inquiry, warned last week that any stonewalling by the White House will be considered obstruction of justice.",

      "author": "Mary Papenfuss",
      "content": " As even Republican lawmakers and foreign policy experts reel over Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unilateral decision to abandon Kurdish allies to an assault from Turkey in Syria, the president himself apparently has an explanation: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a little conflict of interest\u00e2\u0080\u009d concerning Turkey. Trump made the comment in a Breitbart News interview in December 2015 during his presidential campaign when asked how he would handle Turkey and Syria. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a little conflict of interest \u00e2\u0080\u0099cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump boasted in response. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tremendously successful job. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called Trump Towers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 two towers, instead of one, not the usual one; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten to know Turkey very well. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re amazing people, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re incredible people. They have a strong leader.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said then that the situation was \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplicated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thrive on complicated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump did not reveal what he would do in the region if he were to become commander in chief. Trump still profits from Trump Towers in Istanbul, and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong leader\u00e2\u0080\u009d then was the same as now: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Though his continuing business interest in Istanbul is widely known, his own admission that it represents a conflict of interest is startling. Critics have long argued that Trump, as presidents traditionally do, should divest from his businesses to avoid conflicts of interest that threaten to put his personal benefit ahead of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. In a late Sunday phone call with Erdogan, Trump suddenly agreed to let Turkey occupy a strip of northern Syria, currently controlled by ethnic Kurds who have been America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most effective allies in battling the so-called Islamic State. Now supporters fear a U.S.-enabled slaughter of the Kurds, who have a centuries-long dispute with Turkey over self-rule. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone was absolutely flabbergasted by this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retired Adm. James Stavridis said Monday on MSNBC, referring to the Pentagon perspective on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody saw it coming, and that is a real problem when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to conduct not only foreign policy ... but also military operations. That kind of whipsawing effect is extremely detrimental, not only in this tactical situation but strategically, as our planners try and prepare in other theaters, from North Korea to Afghanistan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (See the video above at 9:18.) White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Monday that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision had nothing to do with the Trump Towers Istanbul complex. Check out Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Breitbart interview about his \u00e2\u0080\u009cconflict of interest\u00e2\u0080\u009d below. The section on Turkey begins at the start. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that Trump owns Trump Towers in Istanbul. Rather, according to The New York Times, he licensed his name to the developers for a fee.",

      "author": "Mary Papenfuss",
      "content": " In a fractured White House news conference Monday, President Donald Trump claimed poll numbers supporting him have jumped 17 percentage points. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s despite an impeachment inquiry and the uproar over his decision Sunday night to draw down U.S. troops as\u00c2\u00a0Kurdish allies face a Turkish incursion into Syria. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not known which poll, if any, Trump was citing. Trump also insisted that the U.S. military had no ammunition when he \u00e2\u0080\u009ctook over\u00e2\u0080\u009d as commander in chief, and he characterized the Kurds and the Turks as \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural enemies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He presented the wide-ranging remarks before signing a trade agreement with Japan. The president called the House\u00c2\u00a0impeachment inquiry\u00c2\u00a0into his activities a \u00e2\u0080\u009cscam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the people are wise to it. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why my polls went up, I think they said, 17 points in the last two or three days. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never had that one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The impeachment inquiry was launched last month. Its focus is a July 25 phone call from Trump to Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president pressing him to launch an investigation into political rival Joe Biden. The request was made as Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine. Polls from CNN/SSRS, Monmouth, Quinnipiac, Reuters/Ipsos, Economist/YouGov, as well as new HuffPost/YouGov polling, actually reveal growing support for impeachment. As of last week, polls generally found support for impeachment tying or modestly outstripping opposition. As for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance rating, last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Monmouth University poll found 41% of Americans approved of his job performance, and 53% disapproved, showing little change. As for his controversial decision on Syria, Trump appeared resigned Monday to inevitable fighting between Turkey and the Kurds because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural enemies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He seemed surprised to note that a historian said Monday that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been fighting for \u00e2\u0080\u009chundreds of years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He boasted that ISIS was defeated, thanks largely to him, particularly because he supplied the U.S. military with ammunition when it had none. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I took over our military, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have ammunition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was told by a top general, maybe the top of them all: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sir, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, sir, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have ammunition.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I will never let another president have that happen to him or her.

      "author": "Nick Visser",
      "content": " Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, was shouted off stage at an immigration event at Georgetown University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law school on Monday. A group of protesters interrupted McAleenan for about 8 minutes at Georgetown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual Immigration Law and Policy Conference, leaving the official visibly frustrated as he tried to read a speech about the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard-line policies on the southern border with Mexico. Activists bearing a sign reading \u00e2\u0080\u009cStand with Immigrants\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted \u00e2\u0080\u009cHate is not normal\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy are you listening to this crook?\u00e2\u0080\u009d as others read off the names of migrant children who have died in Customs and Border Protection custody. After the third interruption, McAleenan thanked the event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s organizer and left the stage. The Department of Homeland Security\u00c2\u00a0lambasted the activists in a statement\u00c2\u00a0Monday, saying attendees \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould have learned more about DHS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s successful strategy to work with international partners to reduce unlawful migration and end the exploitation of children by smugglers and cartels\u00e2\u0080\u009d if the acting secretary had been allowed to speak. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe First Amendment guarantees all Americans the right to free speech and assembly. Unfortunately that right was robbed from many who were scheduled to speak and attend today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event at Georgetown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d DHS said in the statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnfortunately the Acting Secretary and the audience did not get the opportunity to engage in a robust dialogue this morning due to the disruptions of a few activists.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Credo Action, the group that organized the protest, rejected any criticism of its actions however, saying institutions that feature Trump administration officials could \u00e2\u0080\u009cexpect to hear from us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo Trump henchmen should be given a platform to spread hatred or defend the racist, xenophobic policies put into place by Donald Trump and Stephen Miller,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nicole Regalado, Credo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign director, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstitutions that elevate the architects and enforcers of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hate and normalize that cruelty can expect to hear from us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Donald Trump and his immigration officials have faced years of criticism over their handling of migrants at the southern border, including the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family separation policy and its recent decision to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico. The White House also said last month it planned to slash the U.S. refugee resettlement program by nearly half. McAleenan has become one of the most public faces of that effort after replacing former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who was forced out in April by a president unhappy with the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to stop the flow of migrants across the border. McAleenan has reportedly\u00c2\u00a0grown more isolated in the department\u00c2\u00a0despite his work to uphold Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy agenda. In an interview with The Washington Post, he broke with the president to say the family separation policy was \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell intended\u00e2\u0080\u009d but that it \u00e2\u0080\u009cwent too far.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Credo Action organized an open letter before his appearance Monday requesting his invitation be withdrawn, and a separate petition signed by hundreds of Georgetown students and faculty also made such a request. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe cannot have rule of law unless the legal academy distinguishes between raw power and legally constrained governance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heidi Li Feldman, a law professor at Georgetown, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a teacher and scholar of American law, I reject the use of Georgetown University Law School as a vehicle for legitimizing fundamental and pervasive lawless government policies and activities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren visited Michigan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most polluted ZIP code for the first time last week. The Massachusetts senator toured a community center and a school in the 48217 ZIP code in southwestern Detroit, where playgrounds sit sandwiched between the Great Lake State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only oil refinery and car manufacturing plants. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) guided the Sept. 29 visit, of which the campaign shared video with HuffPost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that smell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren says at the start of the video, turning to Tlaib in the backseat of an SUV. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what my people smell every day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the congresswoman says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought the smell was normal. I really did. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize that it was killing us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Just as gobbling fatty snacks at the Iowa State Fair is a rite of passage for top-tier presidential hopefuls, a pilgrimage to the 48217 is now becoming a touchstone for any contender who wants to be taken seriously on the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environment. Warren, citing a packed scheduled, passed on a chance to visit the area in July, when community activists invited all 20 candidates participating in the second round of Democratic primary debates in Detroit. Of the three who agreed to come \u00e2\u0080\u0095 former Rep. Beto O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke of Texas, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee \u00e2\u0080\u0095 only Inslee, then running as the race\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-shot climate candidate, showed up. It was Inslee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third time in the 48217. Warren, a potential front-runner for the Democratic nomination, said she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d adopt much of Inslee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book-length stack of climate proposals when the Evergreen State governor dropped out to run for reelection at home in August. Now she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s covering the same ground, visiting the kind of frontline community that could lend her credibility as her campaign courts older Black voters, a key demographic to winning the nomination. The area, crisscrossed by highways and choked by air emissions, made a powerful backdrop for Warren just days after releasing a meaty proposal to restore union membership. The policy outline came out just as the United Auto Workers union was preparing for a long-haul strike against Detroit giant General Motors. After photographing legally questionable flaring \u00e2\u0080\u0095 when excess gas is vented into the air and burned \u00e2\u0080\u0095 at the Marathon Petroleum Corp. refinery next door to the Kemeny Recreation Center, Warren drove by Salina Elementary School, where Tlaib says officials only recently installed air filtration systems to protect students from cancer-causing particulate matter spewed from the neighboring AK Steel plant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese big corporations have enough muscle with the government that they squeeze it to get tax breaks. So the cost of running these schools and keeping these roads paved fall disproportionately on you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren says to a trio of activists. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not only paying the cost in terms of what you breathe, what your children breathe, your bodies \u00e2\u0080\u0095 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also paying the cost out of pocket.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Less than a week after suffering a heart attack, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) addressed hundreds of campaign staffers on Monday afternoon to offer his gratitude for their work and assure them he is more committed than ever to winning the Democratic presidential nomination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIronically, I will tell you that I feel more strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, according to the campaign. The mood amongst the staffers who were on the brief call was boisterous,\u00c2\u00a0according to three people who were on the call who requested anonymity to speak without authorization. One of the campaign aides described being moved by Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reminder that their campaign \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which boasts the slogan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot me. Us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was about the hopes and dreams of millions of working people seeking a better life. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou work so fucking hard on these things, that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good to hear the person you work for have this really kind of humbling approach to it all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the aide said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe said \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take your eye off the ball\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in a way that really got people moving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The call embodied the broader response that the campaign has had since Sanders was hospitalized late Tuesday night with chest pain that ended up being a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmyocardial infarction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or heart attack: That Sanders is well on his way back to full health, that his fight for Medicare for All is more personal than ever, and that he has no plans to slow down his campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe working class Americans who are the core of Bernie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement wake up each day and battle adversity of all kinds, and we believe they will be drawn even closer to the senator as he continues to fight for a shared vision to transform our country so it works for all of us \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just the wealthy and well-connected,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement on Monday. Sanders, 78, was treated in Las Vegas, Nevada, with the insertion of two stents to unclog one of his arteries. On Friday, he emerged from the hospital alongside his wife Jane with a triumphant fist in the air, recorded a video for his supporters on social media, and returned home to Burlington, Vermont. He and his wife took a walk in the rain on Monday, which CNN captured on camera. In addition to facing the politically tricky task of persuading primary voters that a septuagenarian heart attack survivor is up to the task of winning the White House, the Sanders campaign is already working to quiet skepticism of its immediate response to his ailment. Nearly three days passed between Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hospitalization and the announcement on Friday that he had suffered a heart attack. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 team maintains that they provided the accurate medical information as soon as it was available; they were not sure of the diagnosis until he was discharged from the hospital. In keeping with a mid-September promise, Sanders will be releasing his full medical records in the near future, though the campaign did not provide any additional details about timing. The Sanders campaign did its best to continue with business as usual in the days following his hospitalization. Over the weekend, the campaign dispatched three of its co-chairs \u00e2\u0080\u0095 former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, California Rep. Ro Khanna and San Juan, Puerto Rico, Mayor Carmen Yul\u00c3\u00adn Cruz \u00e2\u0080\u0095 to barnstorm the early primary states with a packed schedule of events. And early Monday morning, the campaign released Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 plan to get corporate money out of politics, including the cash-riddled presidential nominating conventions. Sanders will have his first chance to demonstrate his vitality at the fourth Democratic presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Oct. 15. The Vermont senator does not have any public events planned prior to the debate; he canceled a scheduled appearance at an LGBTQ town hall on CNN this Thursday. In the meantime, the campaign is keen to showcase the strength of Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 support network, which appears to have been inspired by his hospitalization to redouble their efforts on his behalf. The campaign announced on Sunday that its staff and volunteers had met its goal of making 1 million phone calls to voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and California in ten days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time. According to an aide, the campaign experienced a spike in volunteers on Wednesday after news of Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hospitalization broke, pushing the phone call tally up to 1.3 million. The figure is not surprising given the frenzy of emotion among his supporters following his hospitalization. A number of Sanders partisans with significant social media followings downplayed the significance of the stent procedure and highlighted the speed of Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recovery. And the campaign racked up 8,000 donations on Wednesday, according to co-chair, Rep. Ro Khanna of California. One of the donors was RoseAnn DeMoro, the former executive director of the National Nurses United union, and a prominent campaign supporter, who chipped in $100. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was like a rallying cry. It was incredible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d DeMoro said of the outpouring of support for Sanders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference between having a movement as opposed to just a campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sanders supporters, many of whom have lost faith in more conventional politicians, are famously passionate in their support for Sanders. The prospect that a health scare could damage his standing in the polls prompted so much renewed involvement due to supporters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 belief that Sanders is uniquely equipped to defeat Trump and solve the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems, according to Jim Zogby, a pollster and top Sanders surrogate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople all of a sudden woke up and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Bernie might not be in the mix \u00e2\u0080\u0095 this can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Zogby, who also runs the Arab American Institute. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe comes back to an invigorated campaign with a staff and a support base that has doubled down in their efforts to make this happen. Because they realize that for them \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and for me \u00e2\u0080\u0095 he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the critical choice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Calls for Sanders\u00c2\u00a0to drop out of the race \u00e2\u0080\u0095 however few they were in number \u00e2\u0080\u0095 only riled up Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 supporters, many of whom already firmly believe that the established media and political classes will stop at nothing to prevent Sanders from winning. The Thursday release of \u00e2\u0080\u009cRising Up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a five-minute video created by Matt Orfalea, a Sanders activist not affiliated with the campaign, added to the dramatic \u00e2\u0080\u009cus versus them\u00e2\u0080\u009d narrative that has long animated Bernie World. Orfalea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video, which many called an advertisement, showed numerous clips of pundits, reporters and comedians mocking Sanders on a series of topics, juxtaposed with footage of him doing the opposite \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0greeting supporters with a smile, listening sympathetically, speaking to crowds of diverse voters. The spot, which featured some of the do-it-yourself charm of the 2016 campaign, earned plaudits from prominent Democrats who are not supporting Sanders but are nonetheless sympathetic to claims of media bias against him. In just a few days, the video racked up over 6.3 million views on Twitter alone \u00e2\u0080\u0095 far more than Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 first official campaign ad, which came out days earlier. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that deeply resonates and it was released at the perfect moment, when Bernie needed it the most,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rebecca Katz, a progressive strategist who is not aligned with any presidential candidate, said of the video. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the kind of things voters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just watch but also share.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A question on the minds of some poll watchers is nonetheless how Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 heart attack affects the campaign of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 70, a fellow progressive who has surpassed Sanders in national and early primary-state polls. In a gesture of solidarity, Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign bought dinner on Wednesday for Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 staff at his campaign headquarters in Washington. The Warren campaign declined to comment for this story. But two prominent Warren supporters suggested that Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued presence in the race could only help her candidacy. Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren, argued that the presence of another left candidate is mutually beneficial. It increases the legitimacy of their shared ideas, and is liable to dissuade super-rich donors from erecting a super PAC to take out either one of them, he posited. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you knock one out, you help the other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Green said of such a scenario. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if you run ads hitting both of them, you just elevate them as the two most clear and transformational progressives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Murshed Zaheed, a partner at the progressive communications firm Megaphone Strategies who previously worked for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), echoed Green\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sentiments, likening it to a progressive race to the top. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no coincidence that both of them are smashing the neoliberals in this race in terms of fundraising,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Zaheed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCompetition makes each one better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday wades into a major LGBT rights dispute over whether a landmark decades-old federal anti-discrimination law that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex covers gay and transgender workers. The justices, a day after kicking off their new nine-month term, are set to hear two hours of arguments in three related cases, with LGBT rights activists planning demonstrations outside the courthouse. The Supreme Court delivered an important gay rights decision in 2015 legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. Its dynamics on LGBT issues, however, changed following the 2018 retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who backed gay rights in major cases and wrote the same-sex marriage ruling. At issue is whether gay and transgender people are protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex as well as race, color, national origin and religion. The legal fight focuses on the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009csex\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Title VII. The plaintiffs, along with civil rights groups and many large companies, have argued that discriminating against gay and transgender workers is inherently based on their sex and consequently is illegal. The court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 5-4 conservative majority includes two justices appointed by President Donald Trump, whose administration has argued that Title VII does not cover sexual orientation or gender identity. The arguments present the court with its first major test on gay and transgender rights since Trump appointed conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh to replace Kennedy, with the four liberal justices sympathetic to LGBT rights. Kavanaugh, whose approach to gay rights is unclear, could provide a pivotal vote. A ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would give gay and transgender workers greater protections, especially in the 28 U.S. states that do not already have comprehensive measures against employment discrimination. A ruling against the plaintiffs would mean gay and transgender people in those states would have few options to challenge workplace discrimination. The court will hear two cases about gay people who have said they were fired due to their sexual orientation. One involves a former county child welfare services coordinator from Georgia named Gerald Bostock. The other involves a New York skydiving instructor named Donald Zarda. He died after the case began and the matter is being pursued by his estate. The third case involves a Detroit funeral home\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bid to reverse a lower court ruling that it violated Title VII by firing a transgender funeral director named Aimee Stephens after Stephens revealed plans to transition from male to female. Rulings in the cases are due by the end of June. Trump, a Republican with vigorous support among evangelicalChristian voters, has pursued policies taking aim at gay and transgender rights. His administration has supported the right of certain businesses to refuse to serve gay people on the basis of religious objections to gay marriage, restricted transgender service members in the military and rescinded protections on bathroom access for transgender students in public schools. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Justice Department and the employers in the cases have argued that Congress did not intend for Title VII to cover gay and transgender people when it passed the law. Conservative religious groups and various Republican-led states back the administration. Big business, typically eager to avoid liability in employment disputes, is backing the LGBT plaintiffs. More than 200 companies, including Amazon, Alphabet Inc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Google and Bank of America Corp, joined a friend-of-the-court brief asking the justices to rule in favor of the plaintiffs.

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Tuesday invited Rudy Giuliani to testify about what he called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisturbing allegations\u00e2\u0080\u009d brought forward by President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal attorney regarding \u00e2\u0080\u009ccorruption in Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the firing of a prosecutor there. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiven the House of Representatives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior, it is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Graham wrote in a tweet, inviting Giuliani to appear before his panel. Giuliani and Trump have repeatedly made the unsubstantiated allegation that former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination to face Trump in 2020, pushed for the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin while Biden was in office in order to shield Ukranian energy company Burisma, which his son Hunter Biden served on the board of. However, there is no evidence Biden intentionally tried to help his son by urging Shokin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ouster, and both Bidens have denied any wrongdoing. Biden and others in the Obama administration have said they\u00c2\u00a0urged for Shokin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dismissal\u00c2\u00a0because he was accused of neglecting corruption in his office and for failing to bring corruption cases. The calls for reforms to Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prosecutor general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office at the time also came from other nations, as well as a pair of Republican senators \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Rob Portman of Ohio and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Giuliani has found himself ensnared in the House impeachment probe, which was fueled by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repeated requests for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to aid both Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr in an investigation of Biden.\u00c2\u00a0Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee last week subpoenaed Giuliani for documents dating back to January 2017 regarding his communications with Ukrainian officials. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear yet whether Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony would occur in a public or private setting. The former New York City mayor has not said whether he will comply, but an appearance in public could be risky for him. Democrats are eager to cross-examine the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer about his role in the controversy, as Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), a 2020 presidential candidate and Judiciary Committee member, made clear on Tuesday: Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey, two other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination next year, also serve on the panel. Democrats have also\u00c2\u00a0written to Graham requesting he invite Barr and other senior Trump administration officials to testify about the matter, but the GOP chairman has resisted, characterizing the move as an effort to smear Trump.",

      "content": "Instagram is poised to be one of the worst breeding grounds for political fake news ahead of the 2020 election, and hardly anyone is paying attention. The Facebook-owned platform has largely escaped the leery eye cast upon its parent company and Twitter, which have taken most of the blame for housing foreign disinformation campaigns in 2016.\u00c2\u00a0But\u00c2\u00a0Instagram was \u00e2\u0080\u009cperhaps the most effective platform\u00e2\u0080\u009d that the Internet Research Agency \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kremlin-linked troll farm \u00e2\u0080\u0094 used to target voters in the last election, according to a report commissioned by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. And as one of the fastest-growing social media platforms, Instagram has around 1 billion active users (more than three times as many as Twitter) and is a go-to source for political news among Gen Zers\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 most of whom will be old enough to vote next year. By following just one conspiracy-minded account on Instagram, users can wind up viewing dozens more \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all promoted by a platform that is designed to keep them on the app even if it means distributing propaganda to do so. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstagram has skated by,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Paul Barrett, an adjunct law professor at New York University and author of the report \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisinformation and the 2020 Election.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize the potential for sliding into the swamp of disinformation on Instagram.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I wanted to see firsthand how political disinformation performs on Instagram, so I created a new account and searched for profiles promoting QAnon \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the viral, far-right conspiracy theory movement that baselessly claims there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deep-state cabal of Satanic, liberal pedophiles trying to take down Trump. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hard to find them. The first QAnon profile I saw had nearly 60,000 followers, and after I clicked on it, Instagram took the reins and recommended dozens more for me to follow. So, I followed them. As I did, more and more Instagram-recommended QAnon accounts appeared in their place, like a digital conveyor belt of hyperpartisan fringe content. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a quick glimpse of what I saw next on my \u00e2\u0080\u009cExplore\u00e2\u0080\u009d page \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the algorithmically curated collection of public posts that Instagram customizes for each user. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outside the feed of posts directly from accounts I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d followed at Instagram\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suggestion, which featured images such as these: The point here is not that Instagram has a QAnon problem. (Although, as The Atlantic first observed, it does.) The point is that Instagram, like other major platforms, rewards sensational clickbait with algorithmic promotion \u00e2\u0080\u0094 thereby incentivizing people to produce more of it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mutually beneficial relationship: Greater user engagement ultimately means more ad revenue for Instagram and a larger audience for fake news creators. And by recommending such content, Instagram also legitimizes it, especially as more and more people turn to social media sites including Instagram for their news. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs long as the algorithm tends to favor sensationalistic or outrageous or negative material, then \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps completely inadvertently \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the platform is, in a sense, encouraging purveyors of disinformation to take advantage of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Barrett said. Instagram has been secretive about how, exactly, its algorithm works, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to know much about it with any degree of certainty. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to envision how the algorithm could take an undecided voter seeking information about a certain conspiracy theory, for example, and pull them into an echo chamber of political disinformation. Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Internet Research Agency garnered 187 million user engagements on Instagram, far exceeding its 77 million engagements on Facebook and 73 million on Twitter. Instagram\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to outperform its parent company in this way \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay indicate its strength as a tool in image-centric memetic (meme) warfare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Senate report noted, warning that Instagram \u00e2\u0080\u009cis likely to be a key battleground\u00e2\u0080\u009d going forward. Memes are an increasingly popular vehicle for disinformation: They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re punchy, easy to make, instantly impactful and appealing across generations. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also flourishing on Instagram, which was designed specifically to share images. The site is crawling with hoax memes pushing misleading or blatantly false messages about political leaders and their supporters, as well as democratic institutions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going anywhere. Social media companies \u00e2\u0080\u009care motivated to spread all types of memes, good or bad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meme expert Jennifer Grygiel told HuffPost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cBetween The Lines.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reluctant to act as gatekeepers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even when it comes to malicious content \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because they \u00e2\u0080\u009care motivated by the bottom line, which is to drawing your time and attention,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grygiel said. Instagram told HuffPost in a statement that \u00e2\u0080\u009cfighting misinformation is critical\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that it had \u00e2\u0080\u009clearned many lessons from 2016.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0But rather than banning posts that promote fake news altogether, the company has started demoting them on a case-by-case basis. It recently expanded its reporting tool to allow users to flag misinformation that they encounter on the platform. Those with the latest version of the app will see \u00e2\u0080\u009cfalse information\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the bottom of a list of reportable items, including nudity, pornography, self injury and other options. If Instagram determines that a post has been correctly flagged as misinformation, it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t delete it. Instead, it will just limit the post\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reach by hiding it from the public \u00e2\u0080\u009cExplore\u00e2\u0080\u009d feed. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why each of the following posts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which contain provably false information \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were still online at the time of this article\u00e2\u0080\u0099s publication, more than a week after I reported them. Thus far, Instagram has actually been more aggressive in its crackdown on vaguely \u00e2\u0080\u009csexually suggestive\u00e2\u0080\u009d content than it has on flagrant political disinformation. Its refusal to remove verified falsehoods is perhaps best illustrated by its approach to doctored videos including \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeepfakes\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cshallowfakes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which present another growing challenge in the age of online disinformation. Not long after Facebook declined to take down a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that was edited to make her seem drunk, a pair of deepfakes of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg popped up on Instagram, in which Zuckerberg appeared to claim that he owns people and controls their future. Instagram left them up, along with deepfakes of several other public figures. Experts have cautioned that the decision by major social media companies to allow maliciously distorted videos and other forms of fake news on their platforms could be disastrous for democracy. What if a deepfake falsely showing a presidential candidate doing something scandalous were to go viral on the eve of the election? Generally speaking, social media algorithms are designed to amplify content that will keep users engaged for as long as possible. We use Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and other sites for free in exchange for our attention, which is the commodity those platforms sell to advertisers. This could mean that while scrolling on Instagram you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see lots of cute animal photos, a bunch of workout videos or, depending on your presumed interests, a barrage of propagandist memes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whatever the algorithm predicts will keep you around longest. Content promoting fake news often becomes popular on its own due to its sensational nature, but algorithms can easily boost it into virality. Tech companies are capable of preventing this from happening, although very few do so proactively. Take YouTube, for instance. Toward the end of 2018 through early 2019, a string of news articles and reports detailed how the Google-owned site was profiting by driving people down rabbit holes of increasingly extreme disinformation, which was having a radicalizing effect on some viewers. The media hype caught the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention, which sent YouTube into damage control mode. In late January it announced that it would adjust its algorithm to stop recommending videos promoting harmful misinformation; since then, views for such videos have been cut in half. This chain reaction provided a clear case study of how media coverage of a shadowy issue could spark public outrage, in turn threatening to spook big-spending advertisers and, ultimately, compelling a powerful tech giant to change its policies. Instagram has managed to escape such furor because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been very limited reporting on its role as a disinformation network, which is partly due to the fact that it abruptly shut down its public API (Application Programming Interface) last year amid the fallout of Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data privacy scandal. Simply put, this has made it near-impossible for researchers to gather meaningful data about the spread of fake news and extremist content on the platform. Without such data, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less for journalists to report on, and consequently, less pressure on Instagram to make changes. In lieu of media coverage, public pressure and fleeing advertisers, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really nothing that can hold online intermediaries accountable for the content they choose to host or amplify. Talk of tech regulation in the U.S. has been aggressively countered with concerns about censorship. And as it stands, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law passed in 1996, shields platforms from liability for things their users post. As a result, platforms are free to decide what content they will and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow, and to implement policies that can be as vague and as inconsistently enforced as they wish. For now, Barrett stressed, public awareness of the abundance of fake news on Instagram \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in spreading it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is crucial. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really important for people to know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re skeptical of what they see on Instagram in the same way that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gradually starting to question some of what they see on Facebook.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Hayley Miller",
      "content": " The State Department blocked a top U.S. diplomat from giving a scheduled deposition Tuesday before a House panel conducting the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, is a witness to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race. Sondland is \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofoundly disappointed\u00e2\u0080\u009d that he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to testify Tuesday and hopes the issues raised by the State Department will be resolved promptly, his attorney Robert Luskin said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmbassador Sondland believes strongly that he acted at all times in the best interest of the United States, and he stands ready to answer the Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questions fully and truthfully,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Luskin\u00c2\u00a0said in a statement. The Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directive came just hours before Sondland was scheduled to meet for a closed-door session with staff of three Democratic-led House committees. Trump tweeted that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d \u00e2\u0080\u009clove\u00e2\u0080\u009d to have Sondland, a former hotel executive who donated $1 million to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inaugural committee in 2017, testify Tuesday if not for \u00e2\u0080\u009ca totally compromised kangaroo court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said during a press conference on Capitol Hill that efforts by Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to block testimony and withhold documents are \u00e2\u0080\u009cevidence of obstruction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schiff added that Sondland had \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeeply relevant\u00e2\u0080\u009d text messages on a personal device that he provided to the State Department, which then refused to hand them over to Congress. Schiff, along with the chairs of two other House committees leading the impeachment inquiry, later announced they will subpoena Sondland for his testimony and documents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmbassador Sondland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony and documents are vital, and that is precisely why the Administration is now blocking his testimony and withholding his documents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the committee chairs said in a statement. In his diplomatic role, Sondland helped Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u009cnavigate\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demands for investigations into Biden and a debunked conspiracy theory regarding the 2016 cyberattack against the Democratic National Committee, according to a whistleblower complaint filed in August by a U.S. intelligence official. That complaint, which accuses Trump of seeking foreign assistance in helping his reelection campaign and possibly using military aid to Ukraine as leverage, has become the center of an impeachment inquiry into the president launched by the House last month. Trump has defended his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asking him to investigate Biden, claiming the conversation was \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect\u00e2\u0080\u009d and denying that he used American aid as \u00e2\u0080\u009cquid pro quo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kurt Volker, the State Department special envoy to Ukraine until his resignation last month, told members of Congress last week that he was unaware of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to urge Ukraine to look into Biden. But text messages between himself, Sondland and Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, raise questions about his story. In the series of texts Volker provided to Congress, Taylor wrote to Sondland in September that he believes \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Several hours later, Sondland responded: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of any kind. ... I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Before replying to Taylor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s text, Sondland called Trump, who assured him the quid pro quo claim was false, The New York Times and NBC News reported Tuesday. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) revealed to The Wall Street Journal last week that Sondland told him in August that aid was being delayed until Ukraine agreed to open the investigations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt that suggestion, I winced,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson told the newspaper. He said he called Trump to express his concern but the president denied it was true. This article has been updated to include House committee plans to subpoena Sondland and details of texts involving Sondland.",

      "author": "Carol Kuruvilla",
      "content": " A Dallas judge says her decision to hug and share Christian teachings with a convicted murderer in her courtroom was appropriate because she did so after sentencing had occurred in the case. Judge Tammy Kemp received heated criticism from some secular groups for how she acted during the final moments of Amber Guyger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trial. Guyger, a former Dallas cop, was\u00c2\u00a0sentenced last week to 10 years in jail for killing her neighbor, Botham Shem Jean. The critics said the district court judge violated church-state separation by giving Guyger her Bible and sharing Christian teachings about sin and salvation \u00e2\u0080\u0095 all while still wearing her official robes. In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Kemp said her actions were appropriate because they occurred after court proceedings had ended. Her gestures were not included as part of the official trial record. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that from the bench,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told the AP. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI came down to extend my condolences to the Jean family and to encourage Ms. Guyger because she has a lot of life to live.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Courtroom video shows Judge Tammy Kemp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interactions with Amber Guyger after the ex-cop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sentencing. Guyger, a 31-year-old white woman, shot and killed Jean, a 26-year-old Black man, in September 2018 in Jean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment. She claims that as she was returning from work she mistook Jean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment for her own, which was directly underneath, and thought he was an intruder. After Guyger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sentencing last Wednesday, Kemp allowed Jean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s younger brother, Brandt Jean, to hug Guyger while delivering a victim impact statement. The younger brother said he forgave the ex-cop, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think she should go to jail and hoped she would dedicate her life to Jesus. With the jury dismissed, Kemp came down from the bench to offer condolences to Jean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents, which she told The New York Times is something she often does for bereaved families. She then walked over to speak to Guyger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe asked me if I thought her life could have purpose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kemp told the Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I know that it can.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 She said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where to start, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a Bible.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kemp, a devout Christian who keeps a Bible in her chambers, said she responded, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, hold on, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get you a Bible.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kemp retrieved the Bible from her office and returned to the courtroom, still dressed in her official robes. She opened the book to John 3:16, a verse often cited by Christians as a summation of the faith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s teachings about salvation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is your job for the next month. Right here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kemp can be heard saying in courtroom\u00c2\u00a0video. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJohn: 3:16. And this is where you start.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she wanted to start with the Bible, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want her to go back to the jail and to sink into doubt and self-pity and become bitter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kemp told the AP. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause she still has a lot of life ahead of her following her sentence and I would hope that she could live it purposefully.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guyger then asked Kemp for a hug. The judge told the Times that she has hugged defendants many times in the past, but usually after they successfully completed probation or drug treatment. Kemp told CBS Dallas Fort Worth that Guyger aske her twice before she agreed to the hug. The judge said she stands by her decision to hug the woman and now regrets her initial hesitation. She said she had \u00e2\u0080\u009cno role to represent the state during a victim impact moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She added that she did not pray with Guyger or ask the woman to pray. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a Christian, I believe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m commanded to offer her love and compassion just as Brandt Jean did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kemp told CBS. Kemp was elected to the bench in 2014. She has attended the same Dallas church for 25 years and serves as a deaconess. The Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF)\u00c2\u00a0filed a complaint\u00c2\u00a0Thursday with the Texas State Commission on Judicial Conduct, arguing that Kemp was promoting her personal religious beliefs while acting in her official capacity. The American Humanist Association and Americans United for Separation of Church and State have not taken legal action over the matter, but representatives from both groups told HuffPost last week that they also view Kemp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions as a violation of church-state separation. On Tuesday, FFRF lawyer Andrew Seidel dismissed Kemp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense of her actions as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnonstarter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Seidel pointed out that the judge was still in her courtroom, wearing her official robes and in the presence of armed guards while proselytizing to Guyger. Seidel said he understands that the end of the trial was very emotional for those present \u00e2\u0080\u0095 but he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that excuses Kemp. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bringing her personal religion into her courtroom, which is exactly what the Constitution doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.",

      "content": " Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan spoke out against harassment of journalists after a reporter said he was asked repeatedly by a customs official\u00c2\u00a0whether he writes \u00e2\u0080\u009cpropaganda.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnequivocally, let me say that any journalist that is stopped and harassed and treated improperly because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a journalist is absolutely unacceptable \u00e2\u0080\u0095 unequivocally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Morgan said during a Tuesday press briefing at the White House. Defense One editor Ben Watson reported last week that a passport screening official at Dulles International Airport in Virginia questioned him incessantly while holding on to the document. Watson said that after identifying himself as a journalist, the official asked four times, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou write propaganda, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Tuesday, Morgan urged anyone who has faced such treatment to immediately report it to either the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Professional Responsibility or the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can disagree all we want,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, clarifying that \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisrespect doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean disagreement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little thing in the country called freedom of speech, so anything that we do that would impede that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to hold people accountable. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unacceptable \u00e2\u0080\u0095 100%,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Morgan said. Watson said of the incident that he initially denied the officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claims that he wrote \u00e2\u0080\u009cpropaganda,\u00e2\u0080\u009d then answered affirmatively \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the purposes of expediting this conversation\u00e2\u0080\u009d before he was handed back his passport. Watson has filed a civil rights complaint as a result, though he has yet to receive an update on the matter. He told HuffPost that Morgan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest statement is a step in the right direction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are encouraged by the acting commissioner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks today, and the overall positive and pragmatic responses this incident has generated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Watson said Tuesday over email. On Saturday, a CBP spokesperson told HuffPost the agency is aware of the \u00e2\u0080\u009calleged\u00c2\u00a0inappropriate conduct at Washington Dulles International airport and we are investigating the allegation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Several similar cases of alleged harassment have been reported throughout the past year. British journalist James Dyer\u00c2\u00a0tweeted in August that he was derided as a member of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfake news media\u00e2\u0080\u009d by a CBP agent at Los Angeles International Airport. In February, CBP issued an apology to BuzzFeed News reporter David Mack for an agent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cinappropriate remarks\u00e2\u0080\u009d made at New York City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s JFK Airport. According to the outlet, Mack was targeted with an aggressive line of questioning over his coverage of President Donald Trump.",

      "content": " Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is vowing to hit Turkey with \u00e2\u0080\u009csanctions from hell\u00e2\u0080\u009d if it carries out its plan to invade northern Syria. Delivering his warning in a tweet Tuesday, Graham said congressional action would be \u00e2\u0080\u009cwide, deep, and devastating.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The threat comes just two days after the Trump administration announced it would step aside as Turkey gears up to move into the region, leaving American-allied Kurdish fighters to fend for themselves. Graham has spoken out vociferously against President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision, which was announced Sunday, slamming it as a betrayal of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of local militias battling the self-declared Islamic State. The senator is one of several prominent Republicans \u00e2\u0080\u0095 in addition to foreign policy experts \u00e2\u0080\u0095 who say that if U.S. troops pull out of northern Syria, Turkey would unleash attacks on Kurdish forces, whom it regards as terrorists. The United States partnered with Kurdish forces and other local militias in 2015 to fight ISIS in northeastern Syria. Since then, around 1,000 U.S. troops have been stationed in the area backing the SDF. On Monday, Graham urged Trump during a \u00e2\u0080\u009cFox & Friends\u00e2\u0080\u009d interview and on social media to reconsider his decision, calling it \u00e2\u0080\u009ca disaster in the making\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ca stain on America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also noted that he hopes the potential sanctions against Turkey \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould be veto-proof.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump has not backed down from his decision, but tweeted on Monday that he would \u00e2\u0080\u009ctotally destroy and obliterate\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy if it \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off-limits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Tuesday, Trump defended the policy shift, tweeting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and praising U.S.-Turkey relations. Continuing, he asserted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cany unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, the same day, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said the country would not bow to pressure from the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security is concerned, we determine our own path, but we set our own limits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, according to The Associated Press.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Democratic strategists are increasingly fretful about President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reelection war chest, worried the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign will be able to define any potential nominee before the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominee can assemble the money necessary to fight back. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, along with the Republican National Committee, announced earlier this month they raised more than $125 million, and has more than $156 million on hand. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, because of its partnership with the RNC and state Republican parties, is able to bring in much more from a single donor than the $5,600 haul Democrats can take in. That will change when Democrats settle on a nominee. But the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operatives are worried the Trump campaign will be able to exploit their cash advantage in the coming months, when the Democratic field is squabbling among itself, to damage a potential nominee before they can make a general election pitch. A multimillion-dollar ad buy from the Trump campaign that started last week is helping cement those fears, even as operatives remain skeptical it will deal much damage to former Vice President Joe Biden, its intended target. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you look at what is at his disposal, you see a massive campaign war chest, a right-wing media infrastructure and a White House that he has increasingly weaponized,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who worked for Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 presidential campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPut those all together, and he has the capacity to run the biggest propaganda and disinformation campaign in American history. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the real fear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Adding to the problem: a host of Democratic donors and groups who have promised to spend big on the general election have so far done little to attack Trump before the Democratic nominee is settled. Democrats believe the president, who trails the leading Democratic candidates in way-too-early public opinion polling, is vulnerable on a host of issues, especially health care and the perception Trump does more to help the wealthy than the middle class. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is good that there are a lot of progressive organizations who are starting to make plans for ad and field funding for the general election, but we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t entirely cede the battle to Trump in the meantime and need to be hitting him now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Eddie Vale, a Democratic strategist who previously worked for labor unions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to be starting to make the case against Trump on the economy, health care and immigration now \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like Priorities USA is doing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially in the states, so our nominee isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t starting from scratch after Trump having months of spending domination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another Democratic strategist, who requested anonymity to criticize powerful groups within the party, was blunter: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a number of groups that have made grandiose promises to what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to do counter Trump while we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the primary. So far, most of them haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done more than send their press release.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So far, Priorities USA, the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest super PAC, has spent $2.5 million on digital ads attacking Trump and promoting voter registration, with much of the spending focused on the four states strategists in both parties see as key to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reelection chances: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. The group spent over $190 million on the 2016 election, and plans to spend $100 million before a nominee is selected this time around. But other potential big spenders have been quiet. Democratic operatives have said\u00c2\u00a0former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would spend at least $500 million to defeat Trump. Right now, he has no immediate spending plans. Future Majority, a nonprofit with goals to spend $60 million to improve the Democratic Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brand in key swing states, has spent a fraction of that so far. American Bridge aims to spend $50 million to help Democrats keep down Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s margin among rural voters, but little has gone out the door so far. The Trump campaign launched a $10 million ad buy attacking Biden over unsubstantiated allegations he sought his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business interests in Ukraine, and attempting to defend Trump for allegations he withheld military aid from the Ukranian government to pressure them to reopen an investigation into Biden. (The latter is now the subject of the U.S. House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment inquiry.) The campaign has begun airing the ads in the first four voting states in the Democratic 2020 presidential primary process \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u00e2\u0080\u0095 in an apparent attempt to damage Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chances of winning the nomination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey lost the election, now they want to steal this one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the narrator says in one of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ads. The Biden campaign and other strategists downplayed the direct impact of the buy. Biden allies think there is little chance the ad \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which includes the disclaimer the Trump campaign is funding it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would sway Democratic primary voters who loathe the president. And Democratic strategists also questioned how well-targeted the ad was. It included a national cable television buy, which is usually associated more with attempts to change the media narrative around an event than with winning over swing voters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Trump campaign and the RNC have essentially unlimited funding to do whatever they want to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mark Riddle, the executive director of Future Majority. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the real question is whether or not he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breaking through to anyone beyond his base.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Riddle said he isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as worried about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ad buy as other Democrats, but acknowledges the party might need to respond if Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval ratings move up or support for an impeachment inquiry declines. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we start seeing Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s numbers going up, and his narrative is taking hold, then it might be time to shift something,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Riddle said.

Sanders noted that at some points on the campaign trail he was leading three to four rallies in a single day, adding that \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the last month or two, [I] just was more fatigued than I usually have been, and I should have listened to those symptoms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any message that I hope we can get there, [it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s] that I want people to pay attention to their symptoms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hurting, when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fatigued, when you have pain in your chest, listen to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Oct. 1, the 78-year-old underwent an emergency heart procedure in Las Vegas to treat a blocked artery with two stents, having noticed something was wrong when he experienced chest discomfort. Hours after his release on Friday, Sanders shared a taped statement on Twitter, announcing that he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeeling so much better\u00e2\u0080\u009d and thanking his supporters \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor all of the love and warm wishes that you sent me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meanwhile, Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 campaign has hit the pause button with no scheduled events until his planned appearance at the fourth Democratic debate on Oct. 15 in Westerville, Ohio.",

      "author": "Antonia Blumberg",
      "content": " Two new reports published on Tuesday shed light on the alarm raised in the White House by President\u00c2\u00a0Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has prompted two whistleblower complaints, a House impeachment investigation and widespread concern across party lines. The intelligence official who filed the first of the complaints wrote in a two-page memo that a White House official was \u00e2\u0080\u009cvisibly shaken\u00e2\u0080\u009d after listening in on the call, according to ABC News. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe official, who listened to the entirety of the phone call, was visibly shaken by what had transpired and seemed keen to inform a trusted colleague within the U.S. national security apparatus about the call,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the whistleblower wrote in the memo. The memo noted that the official \u00e2\u0080\u009cdescribed the call as \u00e2\u0080\u0098crazy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098frightening,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and completely lacking in substance related to national security.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The official also told the whistleblower that he or she suspected the administration was taking unusual steps to restrict access to documents pertaining to the call. Subsequent reports have indicated the White House did take \u00e2\u0080\u009cremarkable steps\u00e2\u0080\u009d to prevent Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conversations with foreign leaders from being made available to White House officials. According to the second Tuesday report, at least one National Security Council official and a number of White House aides and lawyers were alarmed after the call and were aware that it might have overstepped the bounds of normal foreign policy. Trump had ordered that almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine be withheld roughly a week before his phone call with Zelensky. During the conversation, Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate unsubstantiated allegations that Biden used his power as vice president during the Obama administration to kill an investigation into a gas company for which his son worked. A National Security Council official alerted White House lawyers about concerns over potential fallout from the call, CNN reported, citing three sources familiar with the matter. As concern mounted at the White House, national security lawyers initially moved to block access to a transcript of the call by storing it in a code-word classified server, a move usually reserved for the most sensitive materials pertaining to national security. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in his negotiations with Ukraine, calling all his conversations with the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaders \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president also dismissed the first whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint because he said it contained only secondhand knowledge. A second whistleblower who is believed to have firsthand knowledge of the allegations has since come forward to speak with the intelligence community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inspector general.",

      "subtitle": "The Labor Department acknowledges in an analysis that its new proposal on tipped workers might accomplish just that.",
      "author": "Dave Jamieson",
      "content": " The Trump administration is trying once again to tweak the rules that govern how tipped workers are paid. This time, their proposal would probably result in servers doing more nontipped work and at a lower pay rate than previously required. On Monday, the Labor Department rolled out a new proposed \u00e2\u0080\u009ctip rule\u00e2\u0080\u009d clarifying how employers can divvy up gratuities among their staffs. While most of the plan had been hashed out last year in a compromise with congressional Democrats, it includes a separate recommendation that has angered worker advocates: the elimination of the \u00e2\u0080\u009c80-20 rule.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In most states, it is legal to pay servers and bartenders a sub-minimum wage, sometimes as low as $2.13 per hour, so long as tips get their hourly rate up to the regular minimum wage.\u00c2\u00a0Under the 80-20 rule, a tipped worker can be required to do nontipped work at the lower rate \u00e2\u0080\u0095 like folding napkins and filling up salt shakers \u00e2\u0080\u0095 so long as it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat up more than 20% of the shift.\u00c2\u00a0If it does, then the worker would have to be paid the full minimum wage \u00e2\u0080\u0095 at least $7.25 per hour, depending on the state \u00e2\u0080\u0095 for that time. The 80-20 rule has been around since the late 1980s. The administration of George W. Bush tried to gut it at the end of his presidency, but the administration of Barack Obama quickly restored it. The Labor Department, now headed by recent Trump appointee Secretary Eugene Scalia, wants to get rid of that explicit 20% time limit. Instead, the rule would simply require that the nontipped work be done \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontemporaneously\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithin a reasonable time immediately before or after\u00e2\u0080\u009d the tipped work. So long as an employer met that vague criteria, there would be no precise cap on the nontipped work if the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal becomes final. For those who support strong workplace regulations, the language of the proposed rule is far too squishy and could lead to abuse. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnfortunately, today, DOL is proposing regulations that make it perfectly legal for employers to take advantage of tipped workers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Judy Conti, with the left-leaning National Employment Law Project, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are extremely disappointed, though not surprised, that DOL is again doing the bidding of corporate America rather than the workers it is supposed to protect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The 80-20 rule is just the sort of regulation that employer groups and the Trump administration would hate, since it requires restaurants and other tipped businesses to keep track of the work employees are doing to avoid lawsuits. The Labor Department says dropping the rule would \u00e2\u0080\u009celiminate this monitoring cost\u00e2\u0080\u009d and save employers money. Under Trump, the agency stopped enforcing the rule last year, but the new proposal would go a step further by doing away with it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a stretch to assume servers and other tipped workers will lose out on the deal \u00e2\u0080\u0095 in fact, the Labor Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own analysis suggests that likelihood. In its proposal, the agency acknowledges workers will spend more time on lower-paying duties: The removal of the twenty percent time limit may result in tipped workers such as wait staff and bartenders performing more of these non-tipped duties such as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccleaning and setting tables, toasting bread, making coffee, and occasionally washing dishes or glasses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Tipped workers might lose tipped income by spending more of their time performing duties where they are not earning tips, while still receiving cash wages of less than minimum wage. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, workers in the back of the house who are paid a full minimum wage could end up hurt by the rule as well, the agency notes. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because employers would have an incentive to shift nontipped work away from those employees to the tipped workers earning a lower pay rate: Consequently, employment of workers currently performing these duties, such as dishwashers and cooks, may fall, possibly resulting in a transfer of employment-related producer surplus from those non-tipped workers to tipped workers who work longer hours. Even though servers could end up doing lower-paying work \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and bussers and dishwashers could lose work hours \u00e2\u0080\u0095 the proposal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authors do see a potential winner in that scenario: Employers that had been paying the full minimum wage to tipped employees performing related, non-tipped duties could potentially pay the lower direct cash wage for this time and could pass these reduced labor cost savings on to consumers. [emphasis added] The proposal did not estimate how much less money servers might earn, or how many fewer hours back-of-the-house workers might have as a result of the proposal. Democrats plan on asking the Labor Department why a projection was not included, according to a spokesperson for Rep. Bobby Scott (Va.), chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor. Democrats and the Trump administration have been at odds over tipped workers for years. The administration has wanted to give employers more leeway in how they can divide up gratuities, steering more of the money to back-of-the-house staffers \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a move that could lower restaurants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 labor costs by transferring some wages, in the form of tips, away from servers. Initially, the administration proposed language that would have allowed employers to do whatever they wanted with tips, including keeping them for the house. After an outcry from liberals and worker groups, the Labor Department under then-Secretary Alexander Acosta agreed to rework the rule. The version released Monday forbids management from keeping gratuities for itself, but Democrats in Congress are not pleased with the repeal of the 80-20 rule that was added to the new proposal. Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said it \u00e2\u0080\u009cappears to betray the compromise\u00e2\u0080\u009d they had struck last year on tips. As for Scalia, who was confirmed late last month, Murray said he \u00e2\u0080\u009cis already proving exactly what I feared: that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll really serve as a Secretary of Corporate Interests.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Jennifer Bendery",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0095 White House legal adviser Steven Menashi, who is also President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominee to a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, is ignoring questions from Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee about what he knew about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his potential 2020 rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Menashi, 40, has been a White House attorney for more than a year, which means he could know details about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump\u00c2\u00a0urged Zelensky to probe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family during a discussion on U.S. military aid to Ukraine. He could also know details about the subsequent whistleblower complaint that corroborated the conversation that took place in that phone call. He could also have been involved in the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparent cover-up of all of it. All 10 Democrats on the committee wrote to Menashi last month with detailed questions about what he knew about that phone call, the bombshell whistleblower complaint and whether he advised Trump on either matter. They gave him until Oct. 7 to respond. He never did. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the committee, says the committee should deny Menashi a vote until he answers their questions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSteven Menashi has left questions unanswered about his work at the White House, including his involvement in the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to the whistleblower complaint,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Feinstein told HuffPost in a Tuesday statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Menashi is seeking a lifetime appointment to the court, so his record must be thoroughly examined. The committee shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vote on his nomination without all of the facts. He must stop evading our questions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on whether Menashi should respond to the senators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 questions. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a great look for Menashi, who already irritated Republicans and Democrats in his confirmation hearing by refusing to answer questions about what issues he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worked on at the White House. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), for one, told HuffPost last month that he is \u00e2\u0080\u009creal doubtful\u00e2\u0080\u009d about supporting Menashi because of the way he disregarded senators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 questions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy thought is, look, if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll treat a United States senator the way he treated us, I wonder how he would treat the people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kennedy said at the time. It only takes one Republican on the committee to vote no to tank a nomination, assuming all Democrats vote no. Other GOP committee members, including Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Thom Tillis (N.C.), have not responded to requests for comment on whether they will support Menashi. Progressive groups, meanwhile, are trying to sink Menashi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nomination over his\u00c2\u00a0long record of opposing and undermining equality for communities of color, women and LGBTQ people. Among other things, Menashi has\u00c2\u00a0denounced women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marches as\u00c2\u00a0sexual assault, opposed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cradical abortion rights\u00c2\u00a0codified in Roe v. Wade,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and spread the Islamophobic myth that Gen. John Pershing executed Muslim prisoners in the Philippines in 1913 with bullets dipped in pig fat. Protesters filled the hall outside his Senate confirmation hearing last month and got arrested as they shouted \u00e2\u0080\u009cTitle IX is on the line!,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a reference to Menashi serving as legal counsel to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos when she rolled back Title IX protections for survivors of sexual assault on campuses. A spokesman for Graham, the committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chairman, did not respond to a request for comment on whether Menashi needs to answer Democratic senators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 questions. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear if or when Graham will schedule Menashi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s committee vote.",

The 18-year-old woman was driving when the suspect, 27-year-old Joseph Schumacher of West Fargo, North Dakota, pulled up next to her in his own vehicle and yelled at her about the bumper sticker, according to a release from the Moorhead Police Department. Wanting to make sure the woman knew where he stood on the political spectrum, Schumacher pointed toward his own pro-Trump bumper sticker while continuing to voice \u00e2\u0080\u009chis difference in national political views,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the statement continued.

A short time later,\u00c2\u00a0cops found Schumacher, searched his car and found a loaded handgun in the center console,\u00c2\u00a0according to The Smoking Gun. Police said a passenger in Schumacher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vehicle confirmed the story told to them by the victim.

      "author": "",
      "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign is on the offensive against a report that questions a compelling piece of her origin story: her account of being pushed out of her first teaching job because she was six months pregnant. Although the reports don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contain evidence that Warren is lying, they show there is no written evidence she was fired from her elementary school job and they open the door to the possibility that she voluntarily resigned to raise a family. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s missing, though, is a crucial fact about the time period when Warren says she was shown the door: In 1971, teaching wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just another profession where women experienced pregnancy discrimination. It was the national model for how employers could systematically discriminate against pregnant workers and get away with it. School districts\u00c2\u00a0around the country followed\u00c2\u00a0plain-as-day policies that terminated pregnant teachers or forced them to take unpaid leave, usually around the fifth month of pregnancy when they were obviously pregnant. A National Education Association survey in 1970 found that\u00c2\u00a0a majority of school districts had such a policy, and that most of those policies came with no guarantee that a teacher would get her job back after giving birth. That placed school teachers on the front lines of the fraught legal and cultural battles for better protections for working women, writes legal historian Deborah Dinner. National women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s groups took up the treatment of pregnant teachers as an organizing cause. Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal advocates recruited teachers as civil rights test cases. The Supreme Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first pregnancy discrimination case, argued in 1973, pitted three pregnant teachers against a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfive month\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy. That case, and the questions it left unanswered, became the basis for the landmark Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. In other words, when a pregnant Warren left her teaching job, pregnancy discrimination against teachers was rampant, controversial and inextricable from the much larger battle on the overall status of working women. The question isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t why her school board would lie about forcing her out \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story of being shuffled out of her first teaching job goes like this:\u00c2\u00a0In 1971, she was a teacher \u00e2\u0080\u0094 her dream job \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at a special-needs school for public school students at Riverdale Elementary in New Jersey. In April, when she was pregnant but not obviously, the school renewed her teaching contract for another year. By the summer, she was six months pregnant \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cvisibly pregnant\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the job was no longer hers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck, showed me the door, and hired someone else for the job,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said at a recent town hall. In some recent appearances, she has dropped the \u00e2\u0080\u009cshowed me the door\u00e2\u0080\u009d line, but she defended her characterization in an interview\u00c2\u00a0with CBS News. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen someone calls you in and says the job that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been hired for for the next year is no longer yours, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re giving it to someone else,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being shown the door,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren said. The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative outlet, cast doubt by noting that Warren had once described her exit differently: \u00e2\u0080\u009c[I] said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this is going to work out for me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a 2007 interview. (Warren told CBS that she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t comfortable opening up about the discrimination aspect until recently.) And it pointed to contemporaneous reports from 1971 that also paint her exit as voluntary. A local news item said Warren was \u00e2\u0080\u009cleaving to raise a family,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while another said the school board hired Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s replacement after she \u00e2\u0080\u009cresigned for personal reasons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of course, what really matters here is whether Warren had a choice to keep her job at all. And to read just those two news items is to miss the reality that in 1971, it was the de facto or actual expectation in the majority of American school districts that a teacher who became pregnant would resign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVoluntary resignations\u00e2\u0080\u009d were many teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 only alternative to automatic dismissal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school district was reportedly no exception. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trudy Randall, a retired Riverdale Elementary teacher, told CBS. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Certainly, by 1971, Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principal would have known that to openly fire her because she was pregnant was to court trouble. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the early 1970s,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the country at large was embroiled in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmajor cultural and legal debate over the rights of pregnant workers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to a history of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism. The American Federation of Teachers denounced mandatory pregnancy dismissals at its annual convention in 1970. By the next year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the year Warren left her job \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the federation and the National Organization for Women were coordinating local name-and-shame campaigns against school boards with retrograde policies. One district that found itself under fire was a school board in New Jersey, the state where Warren had worked. In 1972, the state civil rights commission slapped down a policy forcing teachers to leave school at five months pregnant. An Associated Press story from that time reported the ruling to mean \u00e2\u0080\u009cpregnant teachers can no longer be automatically forced out of New Jersey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s classrooms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Because teaching was one of a few career options reliably available to women, the treatment of pregnant schoolteachers was at the heart of the broader societal clash over pregnant workers.\u00c2\u00a0Schools were also a special battleground because teaching jobs were mostly government jobs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it gave pregnancy discrimination against teachers the sheen of authority. Among the very first federal cases against pregnancy discrimination was brought in 1973, by a Minnesota teacher named Margo Seaman, who sued her school district for forcing her, when she was seven months pregnant, to take a semesterlong leave of absence. Seaman was able to stay in her job but lost her fight for back pay, in no small part because her teacher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s union had capitulated in 1971 to a policy \u00e2\u0080\u009cproviding for permanent \u00e2\u0080\u0098termination\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of a teacher after five months of pregnancy, with no guarantee of reinstatement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And in 1974, the Supreme Court took up its first pregnancy discrimination suit, which the legal professor Nicholas Pedriana\u00c2\u00a0called \u00e2\u0080\u009ca typical early pregnancy discrimination case\u00e2\u0080\u009d: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPublic school teachers who became pregnant were required to take maternity leave beginning in the fifth month of pregnancy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The case,\u00c2\u00a0Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, involved three teachers from two school districts in Ohio and Virginia who were pregnant in 1970 or 1971 and were forced to take many months of unpaid maternity leave with no guarantee of getting their jobs back. In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the five-month rule was arbitrary and unconstitutional. The questions that case left unanswered \u00e2\u0080\u0094 namely, whether pregnancy discrimination was a form of gender discrimination and subject to an even wider array of civil rights laws \u00e2\u0080\u0094 led eventually to the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. At the heart of all of these legal fights and retrograde school board policies were traditional ideas about gender, Dinner writes: the notion that pregnancy, a visible sign of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexual activity, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t classroom-appropriate; that pregnant women couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work without endangering their health and their pregnancies; and that new mothers shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work but focus on their families. Those ideas started to crumble in the 1970s. But they still persist, and, making it all the more difficult to dismiss Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story, they still result in routine pregnancy discrimination against professional women today. Today, the idea of putting a visibly pregnant CEO on the cover of a magazine is still considered trailblazing. Today, the idea that pregnant women place special burdens on their co-workers is still pervasive. Pregnant women often find themselves \u00e2\u0080\u009cmommy tracked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and paid or promoted less than their peers for equivalent work based on the assumption that their futures belong to their families. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPregnancy discrimination remains pervasive, especially for women in low-wage and physically demanding jobs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dina Bakst, co-founder and co-president of A Better Balance, a national legal advocacy organization for women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a key barrier to gender equality in the workplace, often snowballing into devastating economic consequences for women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And it is still prevalent in the teaching profession. Religious schools, for instance, have fought for and often won the legal right to fire pregnant teachers who are unmarried or who conceive using methods, like IVF, opposed by some faiths. Denine Hasan, who is a New Jersey schoolteacher like Warren was, said she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t at all surprised by Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account. Hasan says that she, too, was shuffled out of her position when she became pregnant \u00e2\u0080\u0094 during the 2012-13 school year. Like Warren, she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t outright fired. Instead, she says, she was assigned to a new school, given unprecedented negative reviews and treated with hostility or punished when she asked for medically recommended accommodations for her high-risk pregnancy. Officials informed Hasan, who was not tenured, that her contract would not be renewed when she went on maternity leave. (The Asbury Park School District has not admitted wrongdoing, and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t immediately respond to requests for comment.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I would get pregnant again. Because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just fearful. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen? Am I going to lose my job?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hasan told HuffPost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWomen are always viewed differently than men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIts natural for us to bear children, and then to be put in situations where now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re losing jobs because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emily Peck contributed reporting",

According to the committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report, released Tuesday, an employee of Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Internet Research Agency sent a message indicating that they \u00e2\u0080\u009cuncorked a tiny bottle of champagne\u00e2\u0080\u009d when they found out that Trump had won. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe uttered almost in unison: \u00e2\u0080\u0098We made America great.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0The exchange was highlighted by Bloomberg. Robert Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extensive special counsel investigation laid out a mountain of evidence showing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Like the Mueller investigation, the new report from the Intelligence Committee found that the Internet Research Agency \u00e2\u0080\u009csought to influence the presidential election by harming Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chances of success and supporting Donald Trump at the direction of the Kremlin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the committee, said in a statement Tuesday that Russia is \u00e2\u0080\u009cwaging an information warfare campaign against the U.S. that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t end with the 2016 election\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that their goal was to \u00e2\u0080\u009csow societal discord and erode public confidence\u00e2\u0080\u009d in government. Trump has been publicly skeptical of intelligence community conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election because he believes it takes away from his victory.",

      "author": "Sarah Ruiz-Grossman",
      "content": " California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill Monday aiming to address the issue of Black women dying in childbirth at disproportionately high rates compared to their white peers. The legislation, authored by California state Sen. Holly Mitchell (D), will require hospitals and clinics in the state to implement implicit bias training for all health care providers working in perinatal services. Sponsored by NARAL, Black Women for Wellness and other groups, the bill also requires the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health department to track and publish additional data around pregnancy-related deaths in an effort to better understand the issue. The U.S. has the worst maternal mortality rate among all developed countries. And the risk of pregnancy-related deaths is three to four times higher for Black women than for white women, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most pregnancy-related deaths in the United States are fully preventable \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and they can happen up to a year after a person gives birth, according to a recent CDC report. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlack women do deserve better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Mitchell, who is a Black mother, said in a news release last month. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBias, implicit or explicit, should no longer impact a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to deliver a full-term baby or to survive childbirth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI charge Black women to ask their provider before selecting an obstetrician, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Have you gone through implicit bias training? Because I want to increase the likelihood of my survival when delivering this baby,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. The issue of Black maternal mortality garnered new attention recently after tennis star Serena Williams and singer Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 publicly discussed the difficulties and complications they faced in childbirth. Lawmakers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Cory Booker (N.J.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have also raised alarm about the high rates of maternal mortality in the U.S, specifically for Black women. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe best studies that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen put it down to just one thing: prejudice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren said at a forum in April. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctors and nurses don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear African American women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical issues the same way as they hear the same things from white women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "S.V. Date",
      "content": " Nearly three years and some 7,000 falsehoods into his term and now under threat of impeachment, President Donald Trump continues pushing one of his biggest lies yet: That Joe Biden while vice president intervened overseas on his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSleepy Joe Biden \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump wrote in a statement he posted on Twitter last month. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote Sunday. Yet Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claims about Biden are not only unfounded, but a review of the timeline shows they turn facts and recent history on their head \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a black-is-white, night-is-day reinterpretation to advance Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political goal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty hard to wrap your head around,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Robert Weissman, president of the liberal group Public Citizen, adding that trying to understand Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claims on the topic first requires \u00e2\u0080\u009ca re-read of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Alice in Wonderland.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden had been pushing for anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine since shortly after he became vice president in 2009 \u00e2\u0080\u0095 not as a freelance effort, but as part of the entire U.S. government and its Western allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attempts to improve the business climate for investment there and nudge the country away from Russia. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son Hunter did not join the Ukrainian energy company Burisma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s board until 2014. And the push to increase corruption investigations in Ukraine was likely to hurt Burisma, not help it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because the probes were being thwarted to protect Burisma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s owner when Joe Biden told Ukrainian officials that $1 billion in loan guarantees would be blocked if the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prosecutor general at the time was not fired. That prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was generally regarded as corrupt and unwilling to press cases against politically connected targets. Following the vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultimatum, Shokin was ousted in March 2016. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDonald Trump is so terrified of facing off against Joe Biden in 2020 that he committed an unprecedented abuse of power and threw his presidency into free fall by trying to force Ukraine to spread a universally debunked, right-wing conspiracy theory about him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s melting-down on television and publicly begging other foreign countries to bail his flailing campaign out with lies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet for Trump, attacking Biden while simultaneously trying to enmesh him in a previously separate conspiracy theory that absolves both Trump and Russia from questions about foreign meddling in the 2016 election has become an obsession, one top longtime Trump adviser told HuffPost. Not only is Trump making baseless remarks about it in public and on Twitter, he has dispatched the Justice Department, the State Department and his private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to travel the globe to prove it true. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a one-man wrecking crew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the adviser said on condition of anonymity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why he just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get over it. Everybody wishes he would knock it off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s White House did not respond to HuffPost queries for this story. Authoritarianism expert Ruth Ben-Ghiat, meanwhile, said that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasing willingness to use his executive branch agencies to further his re-election campaign and to block investigations into him has dangerous historical parallels \u00e2\u0080\u0095 such as Italian strongman Benito Mussolini in the 1930s. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMussolini did this before he shut down an investigation that was ruining him by declaring dictatorship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ben-Ghiat, a New York University history professor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe openness of it all is the next stage of declaring you are above the law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d   Trump and his top advisers decided last year that Biden would be his toughest general election opponent in 2020, and Trump long has been frequently attacking him in Twitter statements and public comments. But earlier this year, that desire to hurt Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidacy merged with a sweeping conspiracy theory that Giuliani began pushing that wove together many of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longtime angsts \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a unified Trump grievance theory, of sorts. According to this scheme, as described on various right-wing internet pages and talk radio hosts, Russia did not actually interfere in the 2016 election to help Trump but was only made to look as if it had by forces in Ukraine loyal to former President Barack Obama. They worked to get GOP consultant Paul Manafort elevated to run Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign in the spring of 2016 so they could then reveal his corruption later that summer, forcing Trump to fire him. Proof of all this, according to these conspiracy theorists, will be revealed when the Democratic National Committee server that was hacked in 2016 is found in Ukraine, possibly along with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 33,000 deleted emails. (The theory fails to explain why Obama and his supposed Ukrainian operatives did not publicize the Trump campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s connections with Russian spies before the election, rather than only afterward, thereby allowing him to win.) Not a single part of the conspiracy theory has any basis in fact. But Trump embraced it because, the White House adviser said, it meshes with his unwillingness to accept that Russia helped him win the 2016 election. Not only did Trump bring up the far-fetched theory during the now-infamous July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, but he dispatched Attorney General William Barr to find evidence for it, which Barr has been doing much of this year during unpublicized trips overseas, including one last month to Italy. Ironically, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s readiness to accept Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debunked conspiracy theory as fact is now likely to get him impeached by the House. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he continues to focus on that white whale, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to bring him down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d former Trump homeland security adviser Tom Bossert told ABC News last month. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not only a conspiracy, it is completely debunked\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. The DNC server and that conspiracy theory has got to go, they have to stop with that, it cannot continue to be repeated in our discourse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That debunked theory, of course, was one of the topics during that July 25 phone call \u00e2\u0080\u0095 which wound up triggering the House impeachment inquiry after a whistleblower filed a complaint accusing Trump of soliciting campaign help from Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president. That account was then backed up by a rough transcript of the call that Trump ordered released late last month. Additional whistleblowers are now corroborating concerns about the call, as well. How much those accounts are even relevant at this point is unclear. Trump has repeatedly defended his decision to hold up $400 million in aid to Ukraine and to then ask Zelensky to investigate Biden. Last week on the White House South Lawn, he asked a second country to target Biden and his son. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with \u00e2\u0080\u0095 with Ukraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said before climbing aboard a Marine helicopter on his way to Florida. Democrats are proceeding under the notion that merely asking for that assistance is an impeachable abuse of power. And so far, at least a few Republican senators \u00e2\u0080\u0095 20 of whom would be needed to remove Trump from office \u00e2\u0080\u0095 are giving signals that they might agree. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely inappropriate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said\u00c2\u00a0over the weekend. She added that she would not comment further: \u00e2\u0080\u009cShould the articles of impeachment come to the Senate, and right now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to guess that they will, I will be acting as a juror as I did\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the 1999 impeachment trial of then-President Bil Clinton.   Trump, despite the impeachment inquiry he has sparked, seems undeterred. He continues to repeat his false accusations against Biden, and even had his campaign put $10 million into a TV ad to repeat them on national television. (At least one cable network has refused to run the ad because of its blatant falsehoods.) Yet as galling as Trump critics find the false corruption accusations is the fact that Trump has the audacity to make them. Since taking office, Trump has steered his campaign, his party, other Republican candidates and groups, lobbyists with business before the executive branch and foreign governments to use his hotels and golf courses, from which he personally profits. Currently, he is pushing the U.S. government to host the next G-7 meeting at his own golf resort in Doral, Florida \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which would put tens of millions of American taxpayer dollars into his own pocket, as well. Both actions are a dictionary definition of corruption \u00e2\u0080\u0095 using an official position to enrich oneself \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and Trump is doing them out in the open. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not just the most corrupt president but the most blatantly corrupt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jordan Libowitz, an official with the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Public Citizen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Weissman said that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Orwellian insistence that Americans believe him, rather than the evidence of their own eyes, is even more corrosive to democracy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deeper problem in the corruption of our language, and the corruption of our notion of reality, and the corruption of our idea of truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. And while ethics groups agree that Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work overseas in the years that his father was vice president created at least the appearance of a conflict of interest for his father, Trump, they say, has little standing to criticize it. Not only does his elder daughter, son-in-law and two adult sons continue to benefit financially from Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidency, but Trump himself continues to benefit from projects in countries affected by decisions he makes as president. This week, for example, Trump was informed that Turkey intended to move into northern Syria to attack Kurdish forces who had been critical allies in the U.S. war against Islamic State terrorists in Syria and Iraq. Trump responded by deciding to withdraw U.S. troops from the area and then inviting Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authoritarian ruler, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to visit the White House next month. Trump has a licensing deal with Trump Towers Istanbul that has provided him as much as $7 million over the last three years \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a business arrangement Trump himself conceded was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconflict of interest\u00e2\u0080\u009d before he was elected. Libowitz said Turkish officials had also made 14 visits to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel near the White House \u00e2\u0080\u0095 more than by any other country. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf President Trump wants to talk about corruption, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all for that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut talk of corruption starts at home, or in this case, five blocks from his home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump, nevertheless, appears unfazed by sinking poll numbers and rising public support for his removal from office. On Monday, during a White House photo opportunity, he appeared to lump House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, both California Democrats, into the conspiracy against him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey should really be looked at very strongly because what they did is unthinkable.\u00c2\u00a0 What they did to this country is unthinkable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so important that we get to the bottom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Josephine Harvey",
      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is standing firm in the face of scrutiny, and so are her supporters, who are sharing their own stories on Twitter of when they faced discrimination because of pregnancy. The 2020 presidential candidate tweeted Tuesday to reiterate that she had been edged out of her first teaching job when she became pregnant. She had been responding to unsubstantiated accusations that she had actually voluntarily resigned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. The conservative website Washington Free Beacon on Monday surfaced the minutes from an April 1971 board of education meeting showing a unanimous vote to extend Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s teaching contract, two months before her exit in June. This does not necessarily contradict Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story, which is that her contract was renewed in April but that by June, when she was six months\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pregnant, the principal \u00e2\u0080\u009cshowed her the door.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen someone calls you in and says the job that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been hired for for the next year is no longer yours \u00e2\u0080\u0095 \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re giving it to someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0095 I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being shown the door,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren told CBS News on Monday. The Washington Free Beacon also cast doubt on Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account by noting she had once described her exit from the job differently in a 2007 interview, when she said:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c[I] said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this is going to work out for me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When asked to explain this, Warren told CBS she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t comfortable delving into the discrimination aspect publicly until later in her career. On Tuesday, after Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tweets, people on Twitter shared their own experiences of job discrimination due to pregnancy, or those of their friends and family. Here are some of those stories: Yep. In the late 90s, after 3 years of stellar reviews/promotions, I was suddenly fired within a month of telling my boss I was pregnant. They said I lied when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d called in sick one day (morning sickness), but went to visit family later. I was young+scared, so I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fight it. Do you have a similar story of job discrimination due to pregnancy? Get in touch with HuffPost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Amanda Terkel.",

Earlier Tuesday, the White House refused to cooperate with House Democrats in their impeachment inquiry into Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interactions with Ukraine. Officials in the Trump administration would not comply with lawmakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 requests for documents and interviews involving Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he repeatedly asked him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2020 presidential rivals. Carter described Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refusal to cooperate with the investigation \u00e2\u0080\u009ca departure from custom, and a departure from what American people expect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the main things that Americans are now considering, is the fact that the White House is trying to stonewall and not provide adequate information,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told MSNBC. In the past, Carter has expressed both approval and criticism for Trump and his administration. In June, Carter suggested that Trump was an illegitimate president who actually \u00e2\u0080\u009clost the election and was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, in March 2018, well before Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with Zelensky was made public, Carter said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d prefer if Trump wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t impeached over the special counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election campaign. Carter spoke with MSNBC from Nashville, days after he fell at home and sustained an injury that required stitches on his forehead.",

      "content": "The White House is pushing back against the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump by refusing to cooperate with lawmakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 demands for documents and interviews related to the investigation, setting up a constitutional crisis. The eight-page letter, signed Tuesday by White House counsel Pat Cipollone, also accused Democratic lawmakers of using the investigation to overturn the 2016 election results and demanded they abandon all impeachment efforts. The administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0095 which consisted more of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political attacks than substantive legal arguments \u00e2\u0080\u0095 alleged that Democrats have denied Trump the right to \u00e2\u0080\u009csee all evidence, to present evidence, to call witnesses, to have counsel present at all hearings, to cross-examine all witnesses\u00e2\u0080\u009d and to object to \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe examination of witnesses or the admissibility of testimony and evidence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Trump and his Administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process. Your unprecedented actions have left the President with no choice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter stated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The letter is addressed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.). Those three committees are in charge of the impeachment inquiry. In response, Pelosi said Tuesday that the letter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allegations are \u00e2\u0080\u009cmanifestly wrong\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0and constitute the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest \u00e2\u0080\u009cunlawful attempt to hide\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to pressure foreign governments to intervene in the 2020 elections. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pelosi said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refusal to cooperate at all is almost sure to wind up in court. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe White House says there is nothing wrong with pressuring a foreign government to intervene in a US election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schiff tweeted in response to the Cipollone letter, which also attacked the congressman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey say: they will not cooperate with an impeachment inquiry unless it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on their terms. They mean: the President is above the law. The Constitution says otherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The letter is the latest uptick in the political battle over Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A reconstruction of the call released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pressuring his counterpart to investigate one of his main political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden. The call took place shortly after Trump ordered his aides to block military funding to the country, as detailed in a complaint filed by a whistleblower from the intelligence community. The call prompted Pelosi to finally launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior, although the president has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and moved to delegitimize the effort. House committees have issued multiple subpoenas as part of their investigations, which have already produced bombshell documents.\u00c2\u00a0Officials who received subpoenas include Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Vice President Mike Pence, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Office of Management and Budget acting Director Russell Vought\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf. The House Oversight Committee also subpoenaed the White House for Ukraine-related documents. Just after the White House released the letter Tuesday, the House announced that it had subpoenaed Gordon Sondland, the U.S. European Union ambassador, for both documents and a deposition. Trump blocked Sondland earlier that day from testifying to lawmakers about the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communications with Ukraine. Last Thursday, the chairs of three committees released text messages they obtained from Kurt Volker, who was until last month the U.S. State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s special envoy to Ukraine. The missives appear to show clear instances of the Trump administration pressuring Ukraine for political favors. Axios reported that the White House wants congressional Democrats, particularly those holding vulnerable seats, to go on the record in support of impeachment. Republicans will reportedly also have more sway over the inquiry once it is formalized. Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office has so far resisted those calls. On Oct. 3, she wrote a letter to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reiterating that House committees had the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfull authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction, including impeachment investigations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no requirement under the Constitution, under House Rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pelosi wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe hope you and other Republicans share our commitment to following the facts, upholding the Constitution, protecting our national security, and defending the integrity of our elections at such a serious moment in our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Republicans have thus far stood by Trump and moved to minimize the fallout from the call. GOP lawmakers who have fallen out of lockstep have been immediately castigated by their party. Read the letter below: This article has been updated with Rep. Adam Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response, a House subpoena being sent to a former ambassador, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response.",

      "subtitle": "Some of the women have serious medical issues, and lawyers worry they could die in detention.",
      "author": "Angelina Chapin",
      "content": " Immigration and Customs Enforcement moved more than 700 women, some of whom have critical medical conditions, out of a Texas detention center in September without giving their lawyers any way of finding them, according to immigrant rights attorneys. Starting on Sept. 20, the women being held at the Karnes County Residential Center were sent to other centers around the country so that the facility could be used to detain families. More than two weeks later, their lawyers from the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES) have no idea where the majority of these women are being held, and they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find any updated information in ICE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s online detainee tracking system. The inability to track these immigrants could have fatal consequences if their health continues to deteriorate, according to Andrea Meza, the director of family detention services at RAICES. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really fearful that their conditions could worsen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meza said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want them to be in another ICE press release about death in detention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The situation highlights a common problem for migrants in ICE custody: They can be transferred between facilities with little notice and yet their new locations are not promptly updated in the system. If their existing lawyers and family members can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find them, they may have to go through their cases without legal representation, especially in remote areas where legal counsel is sparse. And those with serious health issues could die if advocates who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where their clients were transferred are unable to fight for their right to medical treatment. An ICE official told HuffPost that \u00e2\u0080\u009cComprehensive medical care is provided to all individuals in ICE custody\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding that staffing includes registered nurses,\u00c2\u00a0licensed mental health providers, a physician and access to 24-hour emergency care. The official acknowledged that the women at Karnes had been transferred to other facilities, but did not explain why their locations were not showing up in the online system. HuffPost reported that while at Karnes, some of the immigrants were allegedly being denied lifesaving care, such as cancer and HIV treatment, and that suicidal patients were not receiving psychiatric counseling. One woman with cancer in her uterus said she had not received medical treatment for more than two months. Another immigrant, who is HIV positive, said she was not getting her medication or being evaluated by a doctor, even as her symptoms worsened. A doctor told HuffPost that anyone with a serious physical illness requires constant medical visits to stop their disease from rapidly progressing. The lack of medical care in immigrant detention facilities is well-established. Seven\u00c2\u00a0immigrants have died in ICE detention centers this year, and six minors have died\u00c2\u00a0in Border Patrol centers, in many cases because they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t receive proper medical help for their illnesses. The online system that tracks ICE detainees is notoriously faulty. While in most cases ICE is not legally required to inform lawyers when their clients are being transferred, that information is supposed to be accessible via the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s online ICE Detainee Locator within roughly 24 hours of a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relocation according to Andrew Lorenzen-Strait, who formerly worked as a deputy assistant director for custody programs at ICE. But according to lawyers who rely on the system to track their clients, the locator is unreliable. Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch, a Texas-based immigration attorney, said the tool only helps her find detainees 50% of the time, in part because names and birthdates are often entered incorrectly, making detainees impossible to search. It can take up to a few weeks for someone who is transferred to a new facility to show up in the system, which means families are often left wondering whether their loved ones have been deported back to life-threatening situations in their home countries, Lincoln-Goldfinch said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think FedEx does a better job of tracking its packages than ICE does of tracking the people it detains,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lincoln-Goldfinch said. Other lawyers have complained that the locator doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t load properly, or that it will show \u00e2\u0080\u009cno results found\u00e2\u0080\u009d for someone who is still in ICE custody. Meza said the latter is happening for roughly 100 of the women who were recently transferred from Karnes, and that another 660 of them show up in the system as still being detained at the facility even though they have been moved. Aside from the medical concerns, Meza worries that these women won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have legal representation if RAICES can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help them find lawyers near the new detention centers, which may be in remote areas, and share the information they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already collected about their cases. With legal assistance, immigrants are five and a half times more likely to not be deported, according to a\u00c2\u00a02015 study from the University of Pennsylvania Law Review. There are a\u00c2\u00a0record number of immigrants currently being held in detention, which is undoubtedly putting strain on a tracking system that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work well to begin with. But in addition to logistical issues that might exist, immigration advocates say the administration has a record of dehumanizing asylum-seekers and is likely not prioritizing a locator that would help lawyers keep their clients in the U.S. Before splitting up families last summer under its zero tolerance policy, the government had no system in place to track the whereabouts of the separated parents and children. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know the whole for-profit prison system is putting money before people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s humanity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Meza. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a matter of time before we see the next death in ICE custody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated a statistic on the value of legal counsel. The fact is that immigrants are five and a half times more likely to not be deported if they have legal assistance.",

      "author": "Sanjana Karanth",
      "content": " Montgomery has elected Steven Reed to become the Alabama capital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first Black mayor, a landmark in a city known for heroic stands and violent clashes during the civil rights movement. Reed, who has been Montgomery County\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probate judge since 2012, won the election with about 67% of the vote in Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayoral runoff against TV station owner David Woods, WSFA-TV reported. Reed will replace Todd Strange, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been Montgomery\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor since 2009 and was not running for reelection. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet the record show that this is what we can do, as a community, as a city, and let this go far beyond Montgomery, let it go far beyond Alabama and let it go far beyond this nation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reed said Tuesday night at his victory party, saying the election showed \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat we can do when we come together in this city and we build around positivity, around opportunity and all the things that tie us together versus those that keep us apart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cTonight isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the end. Tonight is the beginning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Reed, who local media said was also Montgomery County\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first Black probate judge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTonight sent a signal, not just to all of us here in Montgomery, all of us in Alabama; it sent a signal throughout this country about what kind of community we are right now, not what we were.\u00e2\u0080\u009d According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 60% of the population is Black in the city of about 200,000. The Alabama capital was integral to the Black community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voting rights movement, making Reed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s win a fitting milestone in its 200-year history. Among the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marks on the civil rights struggle was the\u00c2\u00a0Montgomery bus boycott of 1955, a nonviolent protest to desegregate the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public transit system, sparked by the arrest of Rosa Parks after she refused to give up her seat for a white man. In 1961, the city became a flashpoint again when a mob attacked Freedom Riders at the Greyhound bus station. Montgomery was also home to Martin Luther King Jr., who grew in prominence as a pastor at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church and helped organize the bus boycott, eventually leading the civil rights movement nationwide that would influence lawmakers to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Montgomery was the final destination on the\u00c2\u00a0four-day march from Selma, Alabama. That same year, lawmakers passed the Voting Rights Act, a year after the Civil Rights Act became law. Several museums and memorials in the city commemorate civil rights history. The Equal Justice Initiative opened the National Memorial for Peace and Justice and the Legacy Museum last year to pay tribute to thousands of lynching victims. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a historic day for our nation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Karen Baynes-Dunning, interim president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights legal organization based in Montgomery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe election of Steven Reed \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 symbolizes the new inclusive & forward thinking South that so many have worked to achieve.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reed will be sworn in Nov. 12, according to The Montgomery Advertiser. The publication said the mayor-elect wants to focus on food deserts and poor water quality in the city, as well as implementing a universal pre-K program and expanding the police force. He received an endorsement from presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), according to WSFA-TV.",

      "content": " Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) is the latest target of President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter rage \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response suggests that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rather tired of it all. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYawn...\u00e2\u0080\u009d Frey began in a tweet reply Tuesday, after the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reelection campaign accused him of \u00e2\u0080\u009cabusing his power\u00e2\u0080\u009d and attempting to \u00e2\u0080\u009cextort\u00e2\u0080\u009d the campaign by \u00e2\u0080\u009cconjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security in an effort to block a scheduled Keep America Great rally\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Minneapolis. The president chimed in by calling the mayor a \u00e2\u0080\u009clightweight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWelcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the mayor politely clapped back. The Trump campaign called Frey a \u00e2\u0080\u009cradical leftist mayor\u00e2\u0080\u009d and accused him of conjuring up excessive security charges to pressure the Target Center, the site of Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planned rally, into effectively trampling on Minnesota residents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 First Amendment rights to gather and yell in support of the president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s city government preemptively informed the Target Center that it would be responsible for $530,000 in security and other costs related to the event. The Target Center attempted to pass the costs on to the Trump campaign under threat of withholding the use of the arena,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the statement said. After another tweet from Trump about how he stands \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrongly & proudly\u00e2\u0080\u009d with \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat Police Officers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Frey told the president that the charges were necessary to pay those officers for their extra labor\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0095 and that Trump could afford it: In a press conference later that day, Frey told reporters that he woke up to a \u00e2\u0080\u009csurprise\u00e2\u0080\u009d that morning when he discovered the president was tweeting about his city and him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wake up every single morning with not a lot of time on my hands because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing things like filling potholes and making sure our city has enough affordable housing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the mayor said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have time with a city of 430,000 people to be tweeting garbage out, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of surprising when the president of the United States, a country with 327 million people, has the time to do this himself, so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where the guy gets the time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Mpls mayor @Jacob_Frey on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter attacks: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing things like filling potholes & making sure our city has enough affordable housing ... I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have time to be tweeting garbage out, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kinda surprising when POTUS has the time to do this himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d pic.twitter.com/Hn1NpoWYMV Frey also fired back at the Trump campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accusation that security for an Obama rally at the same venue in 2009 cost significantly less. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are significant expenses associated with a campaign rally from Donald Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. By contrast, the Obama event focused on health care policy, he said. It was not an election rally. According to the mayor, the security costs for the Trump event were calculated by a standard methodology used to estimate costs of previous major events like the 2018 Super Bowl and Final Four, the Star Tribune reported. The public safety expenses were expected to be around $400,000 and the remainder would be the result of lane closures, traffic control and various other costs. Should the rally go ahead \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and the campaign has said it will \u00e2\u0080\u0095\u00c2\u00a0this won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be the first time the Trump campaign has caused fiscal concerns for local officials. The campaign has an outstanding bill for more than $470,000 from a February rally in El Paso, Texas. Nine other cities across the country have complained that they were not reimbursed for services provided by local police and fire departments, totaling more than $840,000, according to a study by the Center for Public Integrity. El Paso confirmed to ABC News on Tuesday that its bill was still outstanding. Minneapolis seems to have taken note, as an El Paso spokesperson said Minneapolis officials had reached out to them regarding the bill.",

      "content": " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) castigated President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refusal to cooperate with Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0099 impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, saying the White House was trying to make \u00e2\u0080\u009clawlessness a virtue\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pledging to hold the administration accountable. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe American people have already heard the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own words \u00e2\u0080\u0095 \u00e2\u0080\u0098do us a favor, though,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pelosi said in a statement, referencing the whistleblower complaint that led her to formally\u00c2\u00a0open the impeachment inquiry last month. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions threaten our national security, violate our Constitution and undermine the integrity of our elections. The White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the President is above the law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d .@realDonaldTrump, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable. #TruthExposed https://t.co/elMCHdLYlK Her response came just hours after White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent Pelosi and other top Democrats an eight-page letter accusing them of waging a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartisan and unconstitutional\u00e2\u0080\u009d effort to overturn the 2016 election. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Trump and his Administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process. Your unprecedented actions have left the President with no choice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d read the letter addressed to Pelosi, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.). \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump and his team have been embroiled in scandal following the whistleblower complaint, which discussed a July phone call in which the president repeatedly\u00c2\u00a0pressured Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate one of his main political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden. The July call came shortly after Trump ordered his administration to withhold millions of dollars in military funding\u00c2\u00a0for Ukraine. Democrats have cast the discussion as a clear demand for a political favor in exchange for that military funding. Trump has vehemently rejected that characterization, although text messages sent by U.S. officials\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0095 and released by Democrats last week \u00e2\u0080\u0095 appeared to echo the whistleblower complaint and detail concerns within the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own administration after the call with Zelensky. The House has already issued multiple subpoenas as part of its investigations, targeting high-profile officials including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. The White House itself has also been subpoenaed for Ukraine-related documents. In her statement on Tuesday, Pelosi rejected the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claims that the impeachment inquiry was out of bounds, calling those claims \u00e2\u0080\u009cmanifestly wrong\u00e2\u0080\u009d and accusing Trump of \u00e2\u0080\u009csimply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespite the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stonewalling, we see a growing body of evidence that shows that President Trump abused his office and violated his oath to \u00e2\u0080\u0098protect, preserve and defend the Constitution,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pelosi said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. President, you are not above the law,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the speaker continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will be held accountable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "subtitle": "The Democratic presidential hopeful is adopting much of what former candidate Jay Inslee put out.",
      "author": "Alexander C. Kaufman",
      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren released a sweeping climate justice plan on Wednesday morning, vowing to ramp up research on the health effects of pollution and discourage the transfer of public water services to for-profit companies. The 12-page memo marks the Massachusetts senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eighth climate-related proposal since launching a presidential campaign built on an ambitious slate of policy plans at the start of the year. The latest proposal collects much of Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing ideas on improving racial equity and reducing pollution and reframes them in what looks like an ambitious, nearly 5,900-word blueprint on how to implement a Green New Deal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJustice cannot be a secondary concern \u00e2\u0080\u0095 it must be at the center of our response to climate change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren wrote in the memo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Green New Deal commits us to a \u00e2\u0080\u0098just transition\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for all communities and all workers. But we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t create true justice by cleaning up polluted neighborhoods and tweaking a few regulations at the EPA.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The document borrows heavily from the plan laid out by former climate candidate Jay Inslee, who quit the Democratic presidential primary in August to run for reelection as Washington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s governor, including efforts to quantify pollution inequity between communities and apply that data to decisions on where to invest Green New Deal money. Warren also proposes turning the White House\u00c2\u00a0Council on Environmental Quality, a currently sleepy office tasked with coordinating public health policy across federal agencies, into an environmental justice hub. The Warren plan offers fewer wonky details on which agencies should do what work than the Inslee proposal did. But notably included in the senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release are calls to increase research funding at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to overhaul drinking water infrastructure, putting an end to the privatization of water delivery. Under her administration, Warren would \u00e2\u0080\u009cfully fund\u00e2\u0080\u009d the CDC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cenvironmental health programs, such as childhood lead poisoning prevention, and community health investigations\u00e2\u0080\u009d and would \u00e2\u0080\u009cprovide additional grant funding for independent research into environmental health effects.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her campaign declined to share an exact dollar figure. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a relatively novel idea to include the CDC in a campaign climate plan, something the other leading environmental champions in the race have omitted so far. Yet it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely to be popular. In February, representatives from four dozen public health groups sent a letter to House lawmakers pleading for an increase in federal funding for the CDC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ccritically underfunded\u00e2\u0080\u009d lead and climate programs. The CDC is the fourth-most favorably viewed federal agency and has some of the most bipartisan support, a Pew Research Center poll found in September. Yet the CDC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating budget fell nearly $1 million between the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan goes beyond just researching the effects of lead poisoning. Citing the recent lead contaminations in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan, and Newark, New Jersey, she said her administration would \u00e2\u0080\u009cend decades of disinvestment and privatization of our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water system \u00e2\u0080\u0095 our government at every level should invest in safe, affordable drinking water for all of us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ramping up federal spending on water infrastructure is a staple of Democratic campaigns at this point, particularly as Newark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former mayor, now-Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), is running for the presidential nomination. But curtailing the transfer of control of public services from government agencies to private companies is another issue altogether. The private water industry serves 73 million Americans, according to National Association of Water Companies data. For-profit water services put public health at risk, a 66-page paper by University of Louisville law professor Craig Anthony Arnold argues, because the profit motive incentivizes companies to provide better services to customers who pay more and to maintain infrastructure with an eye to the length of the firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contract. Detroit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debt-choked public utility threatened to shut off water to nearly 17,500 households that were behind on bills last year, only to decrease the shutoff rate 70% this year. In the timing of the 2018 shutoffs, just as the city was looking to privatize its utility, the left-wing think tank Centre for Research on Globalization saw\u00c2\u00a0an effort to streamline a troubled facility before selling it off to profiteers. Other cities are actively opposing such privatization. Last November, Baltimore became the first big city in the United States to ban water privatization with an amendment to its charter. Wednesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal did not make clear whether a Warren White House would take explicit steps to discourage municipalities from switching to private water. But the campaign said an influx of federal funding to overhaul water infrastructure should make switching to private water services far less appealing. Income and race are strong indicators of how much pollution exposure Americans can expect to face. Black neighborhoods, on average, have air that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 48% more polluted than that in white neighborhoods, an NAACP report found last year, and Black Americans are 75% more likely to live in neighborhoods abutting industrial sites. The journal Environmental Research published a study last year that determined Black, Hispanic and poor students face the highest risks of inhaling toxic pollutants in crumbling schools across the country.",

      "content": " A video ad that falsely accuses Joe Biden of withholding $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to benefit his son has been viewed on Facebook millions of times since its release last month by President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reelection campaign. Biden, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, has urged Facebook to take the ad down, arguing that it spreads \u00e2\u0080\u009cobjectively false information\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoisons the public discourse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Facebook, which has come under scrutiny for its role in spreading misinformation during the 2016 presidential election, has reportedly refused to pull the video, citing its \u00e2\u0080\u009cfundamental belief in free expression\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009crespect for the democratic process.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The New York Times, which first reported Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s denial of Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request, reported Tuesday that the social media giant had sent a letter to the former vice president, saying the ad did not violate company policies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Katie Harbath, Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head of global elections policy, said in the letter, per the Times. Harbath\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter echoed a similar sentiment expressed last month by Nick Clegg, a former U.K. deputy prime minister who is now a Facebook vice president, who said in a\u00c2\u00a0speech\u00c2\u00a0in Washington that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009crole to intervene when politicians speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Biden campaign slammed Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision as \u00e2\u0080\u009cunacceptable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The dissemination of \u00e2\u0080\u009cobjectively false information to influence public opinion poisons the public discourse and chips away at our democracy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo told CNN in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether it originates from the Kremlin or Trump Tower, these lies and conspiracy theories threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections in America. It is unacceptable for any social media company to knowingly allow deliberately misleading material to corrupt its platform.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Trump ad being contested pushes a conspiracy theory that Biden \u00e2\u0080\u0095 according to a narrator in the clip \u00e2\u0080\u0095 \u00e2\u0080\u009cpromised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While it is true that the elder Biden, then serving as vice president, told Ukrainian leaders in 2016\u00c2\u00a0to fire a top prosecutor if they wanted to get the aid, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no evidence that this demand had anything to do with his son, Hunter. The ad has also run on Twitter and YouTube, both told the Times that the ad complied with company policies. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign told CNN that it \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould not rule out sending similar letters\u00e2\u0080\u009d to other social media sites requesting the ad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s removal from their platforms. On TV, the ad has run on Fox News, which \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like Facebook \u00e2\u0080\u0094 denied a Biden campaign request to block the clip. CNN, however, has refused to run the ad. Explaining that decision, a CNN spokesman said last week that the video \u00e2\u0080\u009cmakes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Facebook has come under fire from the Democratic National Committee, as well as other 2020 presidential hopefuls, for their refusal to block false statements or ads from political candidates. Democratic National Committee CEO Seema Nanda told CNN last week that Facebook was allowing Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009cto mislead the American people on their platform unimpeded.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u00e2\u0080\u0095 who, along with Biden, is considered a front-runner\u00c2\u00a0for the Democratic nomination for president \u00e2\u0080\u0095 criticized Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies in a series of tweets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor instance, Trump and Zuckerberg met at the White House two weeks ago. What did they talk about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added in a subsequent tweet. Warren suggested that Facebook had tweaked misinformation policies to exempt politicians from fact-checking after this meeting with Trump. As Reuters noted, Warren has not offered any evidence to support this claim. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no indication that Zuckerberg or Facebook executives have come to terms with the role their unpreparedness played\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the spread of misinformation during the 2016 election, Warren wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNor have they shown that they understand what needs to be done to prevent another attack in the 2020 election.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Jesselyn Cook",
      "content": " \u00e2\u0080\u009cLEARN THE TRUTH,\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign declared in a Facebook ad that launched last week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJoe Biden PROMISED Ukraine $1 BILLION DOLLARS if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Facebook users were outraged: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat Biden did is what Congress should be investigating,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKillary/Biden/Obama and their dealings for self enrichment needs to be thoroughly investigated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added another. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTruth/facts are all that matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The premise of the still-active ad is false: There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no evidence that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential 2020 presidential rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor general for reasons relating to his son Hunter Biden. But facts like that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t important \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least not to Facebook. Late last month, as Democrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump over his own dealings with Ukraine, Facebook quietly tweaked the language of its misinformation policy, effectively giving political advertisers a public green light to spread blatant lies. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team, which has since been pumping big money\u00c2\u00a0into a barrage of Facebook ads urging people to donate to his \u00e2\u0080\u009cOfficial Impeachment Defense Task Force,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is doing just that: A number of its latest ads have featured calculated falsehoods\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 the kind that are designed to provoke people to click \u00e2\u0080\u009cShare\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pull out their wallets. The strategy seems to be working. Over the past couple of weeks, the Trump campaign has welcomed a flood of new donors helping to bring in millions of dollars, and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval rating recently reached its highest level this year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFacebook is the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s platform of choice for advertising. His supporters are very much on Facebook, and his campaign has spent so much money trying to rally his base to defend him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kyle Tharp, communications director of Acronym, a progressive digital political strategy organization. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the M.O. of the Trump campaign to capitalize on these big, cultural breaking news moments for its own financial gain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Until recently, Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s misinformation policy page stated that ads with \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeceptive, false, or misleading content\u00e2\u0080\u009d were prohibited, but the page has since been updated to state that only ads featuring \u00e2\u0080\u009cclaims debunked by third-party fact checkers\u00e2\u0080\u009d are prohibited, as first reported by journalist Judd Legum in his newsletter Popular Info. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a subtle but important distinction that now makes clear a loophole for politicians, as Facebook \u00e2\u0080\u009cexempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program,\u00e2\u0080\u009d per the site\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg (a former politician).\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Essentially, politicians can officially lie to voters with impunity in paid ads on one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest advertising platforms. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy profiting off politicians selling false statements to the public, Facebook is complicit in the erosion of our civic health, discourse and democracy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gaurav Laroia, senior policy counsel at Free Press, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe company should show some courage and stand up for the truth \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least in its advertising policies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d According to Facebook, its stance on misinformation in political ads is nothing new. The company maintains it has long sold ads to politicians without holding them to a standard of truth, and that it recently updated the language of its policy to make this clear. Although regulations for ads in newspapers and broadcast media are often poorly enforced, news outlets have pushed back against ads containing fake news: CNN recently refused to air two of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign ads, including one that the network said \u00e2\u0080\u009cmakes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, unlike some Facebook ads, those featured in newspapers and on television and radio are subject to public scrutiny by journalists and others. Micro-targeted Facebook ads, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark ads,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which are tailored for specific audiences, can escape such scrutiny because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not always visible to or accessible by the general public. Facebook rolled out a searchable library of ads to address concerns surrounding transparency this year, but the library includes limited information, and researchers and reporters have criticized it for being incomplete. And, as the 2016 election demonstrated, print and broadcast advertising have slipped behind the remarkable reach and impact of their digital counterpart. Facebook in particular played an extraordinary role in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s victory that year, in large part by housing covert disinformation campaigns by Russian operatives and by allowing Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team to engage in micro-targeting and voter suppression tactics. The Trump campaign has long used \u00e2\u0080\u009cmisleading, false and defamatory\u00e2\u0080\u009d messaging in its political communications with voters, both online and offline, Tharp said. But now, with Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public blessing and an unparalleled investment in impeachment-related ads on the 2-billion-user platform, the gloves are officially off. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe way that Facebook prioritizes content delivery makes it so that inflammatory content really works,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tharp noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt spreads like wildfire on the site.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Facebook has had a consistently troubled relationship with the truth. Despite its repeated vows to crack down on fake news, the company has maintained that demonstrably false content is not necessarily subject to deletion on its platform. Earlier this year, it let a video that was maliciously edited to make House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seem drunk go viral under its watch. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deceptive\u00c2\u00a0attack ad against Biden \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is one of multiple anti-impeachment ads the Trump campaign bought to push false narratives about the former vice president \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was debunked by at least two Facebook-approved fact-checkers (this was done independently from Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fact-checking program, however, which does not apply to politicians). The ad has garnered hundreds of thousands of views on the site while Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, celebrates an influx of donations. Facebook did take down an earlier version of that ad \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not because it was peddling a flagrant lie but because it contained a transcription of Biden saying the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cson of a bitch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which violates Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ad policy against profanity. (The new version of the ad censors the text to say\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cb*tch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d) Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rising dominance as a news source also lends legitimacy to the ads it hosts, even though advertisers have been relieved of any obligation to accuracy. Sixty-seven percent of its users are exposed to news on the platform, and 43% use it to seek news out, according to a Pew Research Center study published last year. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy to accept politicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 money for ads promoting fake news is especially beneficial for Trump: He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a master at spreading lies to benefit himself politically, and his presidency has demonstrated just how vulnerable American democracy is to disinformation on Facebook. The platform provides an ideal environment for incendiary, clickbait falsehoods by rewarding them with unwavering impunity. By paying Facebook millions of dollars to run an onslaught of anti-impeachment ads \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including ones promoting blatant lies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign \u00e2\u0080\u009chas been able to really adeptly take advantage of [the impeachment news] for fundraising purposes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tharp. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis election is going to be one in the margins, and whoever can really engage their base is going to have the advantage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Illustration by Paul Ryding for HuffPost Saudi government officials killed Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi and then cut up his body with a bone saw, leaving his remains in a still unknown location, a little over a year ago. Their boss, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, will soon host some of the richest and most powerful people in the world to talk about how great his country is at an event dubbed \u00e2\u0080\u009cDavos in the Desert,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he can still count President Donald Trump as a friend, even after the CIA concluded that he likely ordered the murder. Despite global uproar last year, justice has been at best delayed in the Khashoggi case. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThough little progress has been made until now, it does not have to remain this way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Khashoggi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fianc\u00c3\u00a9e at the time of his death, Hatice Cengiz, wrote in the Post in late September. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI continue to hope the United States decides to stand for what is right. In the meantime, I will continue seeking justice for Jamal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and hope that people and governments the world over will join me in my quest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Saudi Arabia and its de facto ruler, the prince colloquially known as MBS, have used that borrowed time to shore up their image on the world stage. High-profile backing from Trump has helped. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the less flashy work that has counted even more. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s people like the ones below \u00e2\u0080\u0095 let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call them the Saudi Seven \u00e2\u0080\u0095 whom Cengiz and human rights groups will have to confront if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any hope for accountability. Khashoggi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s murder \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoes beyond religion, language or geography,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a matter of humanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These are the people who have made it possible so far for Saudi Arabia to remain a member of the international community in relatively good standing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 instead of a government shunned for the brutal murder, within another country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s borders, of a citizen who sought refuge abroad. On April 18, 2018, Brad Klapper ended a career of more than a decade in journalism and became a paid agent for the government of Saudi Arabia. Klapper left his job as a national security editor at The Associated Press to become a senior vice president for media relations at the lobbying firm Qorvis, which the Saudis hired after 15 of their citizens helped to kill more than 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001. Within months, Klapper was helping the Saudis respond to their biggest public relations problem since the 9/11 attacks: the murder of a fellow journalist, Khashoggi. Qorvis is likely the most important node in Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sprawling network of influence in the United States. The firm stuck with the kingdom even as, particularly following the Khashoggi killing, similar companies have said they will no longer represent Riyadh, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been rewarded for it. The company earned close to $19 million from the Saudis in the six months after the murder, an amount lobbying expert Ben Freeman of the Center for International Policy said is more than half of what the Saudis normally spend across all their agents in a whole year. Qorvis also gained three new contracts linked to Saudi government money in the spring of 2019. At a challenging time for the company and its client, Klapper is a rare and valuable asset: Someone who influential journalists, lawmakers and government officials know from long experience, which makes them likely to treat outreach from him differently than that from other Saudi mouthpieces. He spent 13 years at the outlet that revealed the Saudis \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and Qorvis \u00e2\u0080\u0095 were secretly paying U.S. veterans to lobby against a bill supported by the families of 9/11 victims, after all. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Saudis have amassed quite the collection of folks who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone through the revolving door in all the places of power in D.C.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Freeman said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving folks like that on your payroll really opens a lot of doors that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be open for the Saudis and can really transcend having a toxic reputation which I think the Saudis do now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Former elected officials seeking roles like Klapper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have to wait one year before they can lobby their erstwhile colleagues, a period during which the relationship can adjust to a new normal. There aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t similar regulations for the press \u00e2\u0080\u0095 though the ethical dilemmas for reporters leaving the industry are clear, especially when it comes to working for a client accused of orchestrating the murder of a Washington Post employee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a journalist and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seen as somebody who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working for a reputable outlet and doing objective work and you cross over to work for a foreign dictatorship doing work that is not objective, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth having a cooling-off period so people know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing: this is somebody who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working to push a Saudi agenda,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Freeman said. Klapper and Qorvis did not respond to requests for comment. The story about Saudi Arabia that the crown prince wants the world to focus on has little to do with human rights or journalists. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that the kingdom is trying, he would say successfully, to make its economy less reliant on selling oil and therefore better prepared for the future. This narrative is aimed at winning investment from the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wealthiest people \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and it relies heavily on institutions they trust. Chief among the Saudis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 allies in the world of global finance is HSBC, the British bank, and at the center of its support to the kingdom over the past year is a man named John Flint. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHSBC has arguably become Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most important bank as the kingdom tries to turn the page on the killing of Mr. Khashoggi,\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Wall Street Journal reported in April. The story noted that the bank is Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest foreign investor in financial services and some of its former employees now hold powerful jobs in the government. Flint was HSBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive until this past August. He followed the lead of other top bankers in skipping a marquee conference in Saudi Arabia soon after Khashoggi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s murder. But he was clear that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the relationship to end:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand the emotion around the story but it is very difficult to think about disengaging from Saudi Arabia, given its importance to global energy markets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Flint said weeks after the murder. He returned to Saudi Arabia in April and publicly praised the kingdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial policies. Keeping HSBC and other powerful banks like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup close helps MBS argue all is well and his country and his economy aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be derailed by one pesky assassination. And the benefits flow both ways: those companies ensure they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re well-positioned to compete for the potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in fees they could earn off Saudi maneuvers like privatizing a segment of the state-owned oil company Aramco. So the relationship persists, even as officials like Flint come and go, a vital bulwark against the campaign to isolate the kingdom over its atrocities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur participation reflects 70 years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 presence in Saudi Arabia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Rob Sherman, a spokesman for HSBC, wrote in an email to HuffPost.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThrough our shareholding in [the Saudi British Bank] and our partnership in HSBC Saudi Arabia, we are the biggest international bank, employing more than 4,000 staff to support our customers as the country implements its economic reform and social development agenda.\u00e2\u0080\u009d HuffPost attempts to contact Flint were unsuccessful. On Sept. 10, MBS sat down with a nine-member Christian delegation that included Johnnie Moore of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evangelical advisory board and the U.S. government commission on religious freedom; Christian media executive Wayne Pederson; and former GOP gubernatorial candidate John Kenneth Blackwell. He had met with a similar group within the year. A large portion of the credit, it appeared, went to the headliner: Joel Rosenberg, a prolific author writing primarily for a Christian readership who runs an Israel-focused nonprofit called the Joshua Fund. In a press release, Rosenberg said the group was \u00e2\u0080\u009cstunned\u00e2\u0080\u009d to hear only two American elected officials had visited the kingdom in the past year and called out MBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile there are challenges in the U.S.-Saudi relationship, we urge more congressional leadership to come here, see the sweeping and positive reforms that the crown prince is making, and ask him candid questions directly, rather than sniping at him from Washington.\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Khashoggi went unmentioned in the statement. So did the Saudis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 brutal military campaign in Yemen. Unlikely friends like Rosenberg have become key to MBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pitch that he is an essential reformer for Saudi Arabia. The prince has prioritized reducing the kingdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decadeslong support for a hardline interpretation of Islam that international observers see as linked to terrorism and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suggested he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fan of religious tolerance \u00e2\u0080\u0095 shifts that nicely align with his geostrategic interest in strengthening ties with the U.S. and courting Israel in the Saudi squabble with Iran. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Saudis have our number as far as the Americans and know that the evangelical community is politically salient, coherent, very important for the current administration and important for Republicans since the 1980s,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Annelle Sheline, a fellow at Rice University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Baker Institute who studies how Arab monarchies treat religion. For MBS, who wants to tweak the Saudi posture in the world for reasons that include his kick to move past oil, testimonies from Rosenberg and those in his network are part of a long game. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to result in some groundswell of evangelical enthusiasm for the kingdom, particularly given the way MBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk of the need for changing the practice of Islam can be interpreted as justifying American suspicions that many Muslims are just a few mental leaps from radicalization \u00e2\u0080\u0095 but they provide a new shield against international criticism. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUntil MBS took over, there was awareness within the Saudi political establishment that their major audience was other Muslims around the world, so there was the importance of maintaining the image of Saudi Arabia as this perfect Islamic society, whereas MBS is far less concerned,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with that logic, Sheline said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aware of the economic constraints that the kingdom faces and ... although Saudi has pursued religious soft power among other Muslims, MBS knows that that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay the bills.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evidence of that turn doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist just in stage-managed photo opportunities; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in policy choices like making clear that the struggle of the Palestinians is low on MBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list of priorities and arresting scores of clerics. And the hypocrisy of it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hard to find either: as it speaks of religious diversity, the Saudi government continues to mistreat the sizeable minority of its citizens who follows the Shia branch of Islam (not least because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seen as agents of largely Shia Iran), to work with fundamentalists claiming to wage war in the name of Allah in Yemen and to criminalize the public practice of any religion but Islam. But it sells. Larry Ross, who accompanied Rosenberg on the trip, told HuffPost the group went as \u00e2\u0080\u009cambassadors of reconciliation in the name of Jesus\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pressed MBS on \u00e2\u0080\u009chard, direct questions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d starting with the Khashoggi matter. The prince updated them on the status of the Saudis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 investigation, Ross said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a result of what we heard and observed, our delegation came away with a better understanding of how to pray for the crown prince and his majesty, the king, and their nation at this critical juncture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross wrote in a follow-up email. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat includes wisdom and courage in tough decisions that need to be made to protect the safety and security of the Saudi people and residents of the kingdom, especially in the wake of horrific drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities two days after our delegation departed Jeddah for home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Saudi government did not pay for the delegation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trip, he said. Media coverage of Saudi Arabia is a longtime fixation for MBS. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of what he sought to gain control over in his infamous shakedown of Saudi elites at his capital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ritz Carlton hotel and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the issue his former aide Saud al-Qahtani, who the kingdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own prosecutors say was involved in plotting the Khashoggi killing, spent much of his time trying to influence. So as the Saudi leadership has sought to defuse international criticism, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s invested in getting out its version of events and its arguments for why the world should forget Khashoggi or the question of punishment for Riyadh. Although lobbyists and business partners are key to the Saudis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 global strategy, messaging is perhaps most vital at home and in its immediate neighborhood, where the killing of one of the best-known Arab journalists resonated widely. The kingdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cprimary regional spin artist\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the state-funded television channel Al Arabiya, Adam Coogle of Human Rights Watch told HuffPost in an email. That operation gained a powerful face just months after Khashoggi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s murder: Mohammed Khalid Alyahya, a Saudi pundit who spent some time working at think tanks in Washington and has now become the editor-in-chief of Al Arabiya English. Under Alyahya and his colleagues, Al Arabiya is following MBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead in redefining and reasserting Saudi identity by rallying Saudis and their sympathizers to see the Khashoggi moment not as a chance to challenge tyranny but as a time to stand defiant in defense of the regime. That involves promoting the Saudis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 investigation of the murder, which a top United Nations expert has deemed insufficient, and material like a statement this week from Khashoggi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son expressing loyalty to MBS. And it includes public fights with journalists who are skeptical of Saudi narratives, like Alyahya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recently suggesting New York Times correspondent Farnaz Fassihi was unfairly soft on the kingdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regional rival Iran. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe post-Khashoggi regional propaganda strategy in my opinion has not been to try to launder Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image, but rather to portray all negative press attention as a conspiracy against Saudi Arabia and make Saudi the victim and target of unfair Western attacks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Coogle wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of an appeal to nationalism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alyahya did not respond to requests for comment. MBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk of redrawing the Saudi economy is a siren song for the bevy of large companies that claim expertise in just that kind of ambitious overhaul. Consulting firms have gained unprecedented power in Saudi Arabia since his rise to power. The most overlooked of them is the one with the most pull in Washington: Booz Allen Hamilton, the giant firm that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s known as one of the biggest contractors for the U.S. government and a key force in national security. Although consulting firm McKinsey & Company has drawn fire for inspiring\u00c2\u00a0and helping implement the prince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic policies, Booz Allen under president Horacio Rozanski has quietly provided key support for some of the most aggressive and controversial parts of MBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agenda. That includes posting \u00e2\u0080\u009cdozens\u00e2\u0080\u009d of U.S. military veterans in the kingdom, according to The New York Times, negotiating with Riyadh to train Saudis in cyber skills that experts believe could be used for offensive operations and advising on the Saudi humanitarian effort in Yemen, which aid groups see as designed to justify the kingdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued bombing of the country. (The cyber contract was terminated before any work was undertaken and Booz Allen is not involved in the fighting in Yemen, per a company spokesman.) The relationship continued after the Khashoggi killing \u00e2\u0080\u0095 adding to the veneer of normalcy MBS needed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiven the Kingdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent actions, your firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued business relationships with this government appear to be inconsistent not only with American values but with your stated principles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wrote to the heads of Booz Allen, McKinsey and the Boston Consulting Group the month after the murder, requesting details on their work in Saudi Arabia. Consulting firms and not-for-profit organizations working with the Saudis have become adept at compartmentalizing their work and avoiding feelings of responsibility for repression, by emphasizing that they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the final decision-makers, wrote Calvert Jones, a University of Maryland professor who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s studied the consulting industry in the region, in an email. They often assess that the downsides of those relationships aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that large relative to the gains even after incidents like the Khashoggi killing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see ethical and [public relations] costs as being all that significant a balance to this aspect of the calculus, because of the larger strategic relationship\u00e2\u0080\u009d that has continued between the kingdom and the West, she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cConsistent with U.S. foreign policy, we have worked in Saudi Arabia and the region for decades,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Booz Allen spokesman told HuffPost via email. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMuch of that work has been performed under contract by the U.S. government, supporting our national interests. Like many other U.S. companies, we have also worked directly with Saudi Arabia on a range of transformation and modernization projects to bring greater stability to the region and promote the growth of a more vibrant, educated and empowered society. In our most recent quarterly financial filing, we reported that our entire global commercial business represents about 3 percent of our total revenue. A minority of that comes from business in the Middle East. In any region and with any client, we will decline any work that is inconsistent with our values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The spokesman did not respond to a query about whether the firm responded to Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter. Less than six months after the Khashoggi killing, MBS played at being a global statesman with a trip through Pakistan, India and ultimately China. It was a signal that he still had friends \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and none of those pals matter quite as much as President Xi Jinping. By securing a warm and very public Chinese reception, the Saudi prince triggered the anxieties of officials in America and its allies who have historically been worried about losing partners like Saudi Arabia to U.S. competitors like China and Russia. At the same time, he underscored to important friends in the business world that he could withstand Western pressure should it come, reminding them that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Beijing, not Washington, that is the biggest source of Saudi income. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Asia trip cast MBS in a different light and demonstrated that key world powers are perfectly willing to do business with him rather than treat him as a pariah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, told The Diplomat. Perhaps because of the importance of that message amid global calls to punish him as a serial violator of human rights, the prince repaid his hosts with an extraordinary gift: an outright endorsement of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own tyranny. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina has the right to carry out anti-terrorism and de-extremization work for its national security,\u00e2\u0080\u009d MBS said, per Chinese television. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s code for Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy of holding nearly 2 million of its own citizens in internment camps for the crime of being born to Muslim families \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a blessing for that approach from the man set to inherit one of the most important jobs in the Muslim world, the position of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The unsavory alliance has a simple ideological foundation: Neither MBS nor Xi is particularly interested in seeing regular human beings, their own citizens or those of other nations, as worthy of basic dignity. Each is happy to reinforce the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conviction that governments are within their rights to suddenly and without due process round up those within their power, whether they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re royal family members or ethnic and religious minorities. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all the better if they can couch that approach in language that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been internationally accepted as legitimizing all kinds of violence and injustice over the last two decades. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s model for economic growth \u00e2\u0080\u0094 economic liberalization with domestic repression,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dorsey said. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. The war in Yemen had already left Congress torn over Saudi Arabia before Khashoggi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s murder, with many Democrats and some Republicans loudly saying the kingdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repeated war crimes in a campaign it was carrying out with American support showed a rethink was essential. At the end of last year came a double whammy for the Saudis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 defenders on Capitol Hill: the shocking and gruesome treatment of Khashoggi, and the flip in control of the House. Suddenly, Democrats, who by that point had become unanimously opposed to continued U.S. assistance in Yemen and interested in other penalties for Riyadh, had the ability to get their proposals through one chamber. The hurdle was, and remains, the GOP-controlled Senate. There, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) has historically been friendly to the kingdom and hawkish toward its nemesis Iran. He has the added consideration of Trump, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been clear that he is interested in neither downgrading American ties with MBS nor considering legislation that could (as has already been the case four times) force him into embarrassing vetoes on behalf of an unpopular foreign country. McConnell has yielded to pressure on some Saudi-related legislation (just as Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration gave in to Khashoggi concerns to some degree by imposing human rights sanctions on a small group of Saudis). But today he and his lieutenants on the Senate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foreign relations and armed services committee, Sens. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), have stymied proposals to pressure MBS by cutting off some military backing and forcing greater transparency into and penalties for the writer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assassination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a trio of tyranny in the U.S. Senate when it comes to accountability for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the disastrous war in Yemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kate Kizer, the policy director at the peace group Win Without War, told HuffPost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSenators McConnell, Inhofe and Risch have done all they can to shield Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Saudi patron \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 With the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawlessness becoming more blatant by the day, these three senators should see the writing on the wall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As lawmakers soon try to finalize must-pass defense spending legislation by reconciling ideas from the House and the Senate, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll become clear whether McConnell and his allies think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for them to have that change of heart yet. Spokespeople for McConnell, Risch and Inhofe did not respond to requests for comment. This story was updated with additional information about Booz Allen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business relationship with Saudi Arabia.",

      "author": "Kevin Robillard",
      "content": " Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, said in an interview posted Tuesday she will not hold big-money fundraisers at any point during her presidential run. Warren had previously said her plan to bypass the standard grip-and-grin fundraisers with expensive tickets only applied to the primary. But in an interview with CBS News, Warren said she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do high-dollar fundraisers during the general election if she wins the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nomination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren told CBS News. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, for me this is pretty straightforward. Either you think ... electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible. Or you think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about a grassroots let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-build-this-from-the-ground-up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments, first highlighted by The New York Times, represent a shift. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy presidential primary campaign will be run on the principle of equal access for anybody who joins it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote in a February\u00c2\u00a0Medium post announcing her decision not to hold fundraisers during her primary campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not believe in unilateral disarmament,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told MSNBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chris Hayes at the time. The decision to extend that policy to the general election could put her at a financial disadvantage when running against President Donald Trump, whose campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million during the third quarter of 2019. But she said Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big cash hauls would not deter her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to do the big-dollar fundraisers. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just not going to do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren told CBS. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whole notion behind this campaign is that we can build this together. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a statement, Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communications director, Kristen Orthman, said that the candidate would continue to attend fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee, state and local parties, and other Democratic candidates, and that those fundraisers would be open to the press. She also said that Warren \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like almost every other Democratic candidate for president \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would continue to turn down donations from federal lobbyists and political action committees. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo special access or call time with rich donors or big dollar fundraisers to underwrite our campaign. Our campaign is and will continue to be a grassroots campaign \u00e2\u0080\u0095 funded by working people chipping in a few bucks here and there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Orthman wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs we have said from the beginning and has been our practice throughout the primary, Elizabeth will also continue to do everything she can to build our party infrastructure and strengthen Democratic candidates up and down the ballot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Orthman also promised \u00e2\u0080\u009ca more comprehensive campaign finance plan in the coming weeks to permanently break the stranglehold that the money-for-influence racket has on our politics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, which raised nearly $25 million in the third quarter, has relied so far on online donations. She and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have been able to out-raise the majority of the other contenders for the Democratic nomination while relying almost exclusively on online fundraising. But raising money for the general election is a different exercise. While Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rivals for the nomination are limited to $2,800 donations in the primary, recent court rulings have turned presidential fundraising for the general election into a much more expensive game, where fundraiser attendees can give a combined total more than $300,000 to the presidential campaigns, national party committees and various state parties.\u00c2\u00a0Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pledge means that she could still attend fundraisers that raise large sums for the Democratic National Committee and state parties, but she would not be able to give special access to high-dollar donors at those events. Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director on then-President Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reelection campaign, said Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision meant \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Democratic Party just went bankrupt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Presidential nominee is not just responsible for fundraising for his/her campaign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are the de-facto head of ... the Democratic Party and for all 50 State Parties. The Democratic Party cannot raise the money they need without the candidate doing every [thing] he/she can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the Democratic Party just went bankrupt.... \n\nThis is a colossally stupid decision not just for Democratic chances to win back the White House but for all Democrats up and down the ticket if she sticks to it. https://t.co/V52Z4881S6 End Citizens United, a Democratic group named after the infamous Supreme Court decision and dedicated to limiting the influence of money in politics, praised Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision. \u00e2\u0080\u009cElizabeth Warren has been unafraid to take on our rigged political system in her campaign and put forward bold ideas to take on the corporate special interests and Big Money donors that dominate our politics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tiffany Mueller, the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHer commitment to small-dollar fundraising sends a powerful message to the American people about who she will fight for as President.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren, along with Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, is in the top tier of candidates competing for the Democratic nomination. Sanders has bypassed high-dollar fundraisers throughout his career, though he has held a few events open to both large- and small-dollar donors during his current presidential bid. Biden has raised much of his campaign war chest through traditional high-dollar fundraisers. Some Biden allies, most notably former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, have attacked Warren\u00c2\u00a0for attending high-dollar fundraisers in the past. The Warren campaign has pointed out that her decision to skip fundraising events has freed up the candidate to spend more time with rank-and-file voters, including her now-famous selfie lines. The head of Priorities USA, the Democratic Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest super PAC \u00e2\u0080\u0095 which can collect and spend unlimited amounts of money, provided it does not coordinate directly with a candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign \u00e2\u0080\u0095 said that Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement would not impact its plans. Both Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reelection campaign and Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 campaign helped the group raise money with high-dollar fundraisers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFull speed ahead for Priorities USA,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guy Cecil, the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chairman and chief strategist, wrote on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already up & running ads holding Trump accountable in key states & will be through November next year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) brushed off claims that his presidential campaign wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t being transparent when the presidential hopeful was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nonsense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sanders, 78, said of the criticism, according to NBC News. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what people think campaigns are. You know we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dealing with all kinds of doctors, and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on, really.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sanders said his campaign acted \u00e2\u0080\u009cabsolutely appropriately\u00e2\u0080\u009d by not rushing to alert the media after he was hospitalized. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo the first thing that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to do is understand what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on and not run to The New York Times and have to report every 15 minutes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told reporters Tuesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, this is not a baseball game. So I think we acted absolutely appropriately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When the Sanders campaign announced that the senator was hospitalized last week, they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t specify Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exact condition. The campaign noted only that Sanders had\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cexperienced some chest discomfort\u00e2\u0080\u009d and underwent an emergency heart procedure for a blocked artery. Two and a half days later, Sanders was released from the hospital. At that time, his campaign issued a statement in which his doctors revealed he had a myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack. The episode has thrust Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 health into the spotlight as one of the oldest candidates running for president. Critics have raised questions about whether he should campaign aggressively, but his staffers remain energized to move forward. Before his heart attack, the senator promised to release his medical records before the Democratic primaries begin. He told reporters Wednesday that he would release those records \u00e2\u0080\u009cat the appropriate time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Politico. Sanders also said he had no intention of slowing down his campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sanders said Tuesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love doing rallies, and I love doing town meetings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "A counterterrorism analyst with the Defense Intelligence Agency was arrested as he arrived at work on Wednesday morning and is facing two federal charges for leaking classified information to two journalists, including one with whom he had a romantic relationship. The arrest marks a continuation of the Justice Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aggressive crackdown on whistleblowers and leakers, which ramped up during the Obama administration and has continued under President Donald Trump. Henry Kyle Frese, 30, faces two counts of willful transmission of national defense information. John Demers, the Justice Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national security chief, said in a statement that Frese was \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaught red-handed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Frese has worked at the DIA as either a contractor or employee since January 2017, and reported to a DIA location in Reston. Federal authorities used a wiretap to obtain portions of Frese\u00e2\u0080\u0099s text messages and phone calls. The indictment does not name the two journalists Frese allegedly communicated with, but both are identifiable based on the prosecutors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 description of the journalists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tweets and news stories. The first news article referenced in the indictment was a 2018 story about China quietly installing anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems on outposts in the South China Sea. That story was sourced to individuals with knowledge of U.S. intelligence reports. The indictment also referenced a 2019 news article co-authored by the two journalists about the Chinese military conducting anti-ship ballistic missile tests in the South China Sea. The latter report was sourced to U.S. officials with knowledge of the issue. Neither journalist immediately responded to requests for comment.

      "subtitle": "Civil rights groups say voters in a Georgia city will be intimidated from casting a ballot if they have to go to the police station to do so.",
      "author": "Sam Levine",
      "content": " Officials in one Georgia city are intimidating voters by moving the polling location for an upcoming municipal election to the local police station, civil rights groups said this week. The city council in Jonesboro, Georgia, which is about 18 miles south of Atlanta, decided to move the polling location to the police station in September because the old location, a firehouse museum, was not usable because of construction. But in two letters this week, civil rights groups in the state said the change to a police station, rather than a more neutral location, would make people scared to come out and cast their ballots. The move, the groups said, could violate sections of the Voting Rights Act that prohibit voter intimidation and discriminatory election practices. \u00e2\u0080\u009cForcing voters to cast their ballots under the steely gaze of armed law enforcement officers all but amounts to government-sponsored voter intimidation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in a letter sent Tuesday to city and county officials. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not-so-distant past, law enforcement officers harassed, arrested, and beat Black people for trying to vote.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Choosing the police station as a polling location is particularly alarming because of the relationship between law enforcement and African Americans, who make up more than 60% of the Jonesboro population, a coalition of civil rights groups wrote in a separate letter on Monday. They noted that the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s police chief resigned last year amid controversy over the department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treatment of a Black Lives Matter protester. They also pointed out the county had an ordinance that inflicted a hefty fine for a trivial offense:\u00c2\u00a0allowing law enforcement to fine people up to $480 for sagging pants. Even people who have unpaid parking tickets could be dissuaded from showing up at the police station to vote, argued Julie Houk, an attorney with the Lawyers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the groups that signed the letter. The groups, which also included The New Georgia Project, The Georgia Coalition for the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Agenda, and the state chapter of the NAACP, asked the city to rescind its decision to put the polling place in a police station. The controversy underscores how voting rights groups are scrutinizing polling place changes and closures in Georgia and elsewhere, arguing they are a form of voter suppression. Since 2012, more than 1,688 polling places have been closed in places with a history of voting discrimination, according to a report by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. In some cases, officials decide to close polling locations without giving careful analysis or justification for the closures. These actions could be a stealthy way to discourage would-be voters and influence election results. Before 2013, the Voting Rights Act mandated that places like Georgia with a history of discrimination could not close or change a polling location without some oversight from the federal government. If officials wanted to make a voting change, they had to show the federal government it would not be discriminatory. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down the provision, freeing officials to make changes without having to show the changes aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t discriminatory. During a Sept. 3 city council meeting, Jonesboro city council members adopted the proposal to switch the polling station to a police station without much discussion. When they opened up the floor for a public hearing, there was no one present from the public to speak about it. The city council is nearly all-white. Jonesboro city manager Ricky Clark, Jr. said officials chose the polling locations because they believed it would be the most convenient for voters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Chambers of the Police Department where the polling place will be located is the exact location where all Council Meetings of the City of Jonesboro take place, which makes it the most comfortable and familiar location for residents of the City of Jonesboro who will be coming to vote,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Clark wrote in an email. He added that the police department provided adequate parking and space, something that City Hall \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a location that will be used for early voting \u00e2\u0080\u0095 could not. Clarke did not respond to inquiries about whether the city had considered polling places other than the police station. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGovernment officials have been saying since the Jim Crow era that when they move a polling place it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because of convenience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sean Young, the legal director of the ACLU of Georgia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor centuries that has been a pretext for discriminatory voter intimidation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not unheard of to place a polling location in a police station, said Amber McReynolds, the former top election official in Denver, Colorado. But she added election officials should choose where to put the polling locations in consultation with the community. Even if voters are familiar with the police station, going to vote is different than attending a city council meeting, said Houk. She added that Jonesboro is the county seat and there were other government buildings, schools and churches where officials could have put the polling location. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEspecially in the south, many people of color have strong memories of the use of law enforcement in suppression the Black vote, leading up in particular to when the Voting Rights Act was adopted and since then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA city council meeting doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the same sort of standing, in my view, as say a polling place, where people are going in there to determine whether these elected officials should be continued in their roles.",

      "content": " A woman has accused President\u00c2\u00a0Donald Trump\u00c2\u00a0of grabbing her vagina without her consent and forcibly kissing her at his Mar-a-Lago resort in the early 2000s, according to a book excerpt published Wednesday. Karen Johnson told journalists Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy in their new book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that the president assaulted her while she was attending a New Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago with her husband and a relative. The book, excerpted by Esquire\u00c2\u00a0Wednesday morning, also reportedly includes 43 new accusations of sexual misconduct against Trump. The excerpt does not detail the 42 other allegations. Johnson told Levine and El-Faizy that she was shocked when the infamous \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccess Hollywood\u00e2\u0080\u009d tape was released a month before the 2016 election. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen he says that thing, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Grab them in the pussy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that hits me hard because when he grabbed me and pulled me into the tapestry, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where he grabbed me \u00e2\u0080\u0095 he grabbed me there in my front and pulled me in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Johnson told the authors that she was walking to the restroom at Mar-a-Lago shortly after midnight when Trump grabbed her from behind a tapestry and began kissing her without her consent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was grabbed and pulled behind a tapestry, and it was him. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a tall girl and I had six-inch heels on, and I still remember looking up at him. And he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong, and he just kissed me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says in the book. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was so scared because of who he was.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Johnson, who was in her late 30s at the time, said her husband and relative had gone home earlier because her husband, who had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feeling well. She said that Trump pursued her after the incident \u00e2\u0080\u0095 calling her constantly and inviting her to visit him in New York. Johnson said she rebuffed him each time and eventually he stopped calling. The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for comment. Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 20 women. The accusations against the president range from sexual harassment to groping and even rape.\u00c2\u00a0The president and his administration have repeatedly denied all of the accusations, tweeting that women he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know were making \u00e2\u0080\u009cfalse accusations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In 2017, then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u00c2\u00a0suggested that\u00c2\u00a0all of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accusers were lying.

      "content": " Prominent politicians and others are tweeting their celebration of Steven Reed, who was elected on Tuesday to become the first Black mayor of Montgomery, Alabama. In November, Reed will be sworn into office in a city that is known as both \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe cradle of the Confederacy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the birthplace of the civil rights movement. He won a runoff election against TV station owner David Woods, who is white. Former Tallahassee, Florida, Mayor Andrew Gillum quickly recognized Reed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historic accomplishment on Twitter. Gillum made history in his own state last year, becoming the first Black nominee for governor in Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe South continues to transform itself, one day at a time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gillum wrote on Tuesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday we celebrate a capable & committed leader, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just so happen [to] become the first Black Mayor in Montgomery\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history. Congratulations Mayor-elect, @stevenlouisreed!!! Onward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic candidate for president, congratulated Reed on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongratulations, Mayor-elect @stevenlouisreed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA historic first for Montgomery, and a hopeful step forward for everyone working to further the movement that crystalized in your city nearly half a century ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reed won 67% of the vote in the runoff, according to unofficial returns. He will replace current Mayor Todd Strange, who did not seek reelection. The mayor-elect \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a graduate of Morehouse College, a historically Black men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s college, and Vanderbilt University, where he earned an MBA \u00e2\u0080\u0095 has made political history in Alabama before. He became Montgomery County\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0first Black probate judge when he was elected to office in 2012. Montgomery, the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital, was the site of a number of key moments in the civil rights movement. It was home to the historic 1955-1956\u00c2\u00a0bus boycott, famously sparked by Rosa Parks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 refusal to give up her seat for a white man. It served as the destination of the\u00c2\u00a01965 marches from Selma, Alabama, which protested discriminatory voting practices that disenfranchised Black voters. Ava DuVernay, who directed the acclaimed 2014 movie \u00e2\u0080\u009cSelma\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0095 which looks at Martin Luther King Jr.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in those historic marches \u00e2\u0080\u0095 weighed in on Reed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love Montgomery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome of my best memories in life happened there. With my family. And my father. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be so proud of this election outcome. A new era for The Gump. Congrats, Mayor Reed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And celebratory messages for Reed from other Democratic politicians running for president continued to pour in: On Wednesday, Reed tweeted his gratitude to \u00e2\u0080\u009ceveryone who voted\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the runoff election. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m grateful for the support we received from so many people who believe we can have a brighter future for our city, state, & country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m honored to be your next Mayor of Montgomery, AL.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Igor Bobic",
      "content": " President Donald Trump\u00c2\u00a0has\u00c2\u00a0tapped former Rep. Trey Gowdy\u00c2\u00a0(R-S.C.) to serve as outside counsel during the House impeachment inquiry, which is focused on the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appeals to foreign governments to investigate one of his political rivals ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Gowdy knows a thing or two about congressional investigations. The former South Carolina congressman chaired the House Select Committee on Benghazi from 2014 to 2016, probing the 2012 terrorist attack on an American diplomatic compound in Libya that left a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead. Republicans turned to Gowdy at the time to give the Benghazi investigation a sheen of credibility amid accusations that it was a partisan fishing expedition against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was readying a campaign for president. Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, was held in high regard by his colleagues as one of the most skilled questioners and legal experts in Congress. (In 2018, after saying he would not seek reelection to Congress, Gowdy made news \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and angered the president and his allies \u00e2\u0080\u0095 when he challenged Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that the FBI had spied on his 2016 campaign.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like jobs where facts matter. I like jobs where fairness matters. I like jobs where, frankly, where the process matters. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just about winning and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just about reaching a result,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gowdy said last year upon announcing his retirement. As chair of the Benghazi committee, Gowdy maintained he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t simply out to torpedo Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential chances and pointed to the panel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interviews with 81 witnesses and its review of 75,000 additional pages of documents from the Obama administration. Clinton herself sat for an 11-hour hearing in 2015 in which she was grilled extensively over the Libya attack. Now, as part of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal team, Gowdy will be working to defend a president who is refusing to comply with all congressional requests for information, testimony and documents\u00c2\u00a0relating to the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment inquiry. (Not that the White House is being any more responsive to congressional requests for information relating to matters outside that inquiry.) In a scathing\u00c2\u00a0eight-page letter\u00c2\u00a0addressed to Democratic leadership on Tuesday, White House counsel Pat Cipollone made clear that the administration would refuse to cooperate with what he called a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartisan and unconstitutional\u00e2\u0080\u009d investigation. But Gowdy appeared to hold the opposite opinion about the value of Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0099 oversight powers in 2012. After the Obama White House invoked executive privilege over some documents during the Fast and Furious investigation, the congressman blasted the Obama administration for doing the same thing the Trump administration seems to be doing now. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe notion that you can withhold information and documents from Congress no matter whether you are the party in power or not in power is wrong. Respect for the rule of law must mean something, irrespective of the vicissitudes of political cycles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gowdy said at the time. (The Obama administration eventually released thousands of pages of Fast and Furious-related documents under court order.) Gowdy isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only former Benghazi committee member now defending Trump in the impeachment investigation. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also served on the Benghazi panel, as a Kansas congressman, and pressed the Obama administration to cooperate in that inquiry, demanding documents and testimony from dozens of government officials. This week, however, Pompeo helped block Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a central player in the Ukraine controversy, from testifying before Congress.",

      "subtitle": "Yes, this sort of discrimination happened in the 1970s, when Elizabeth Warren was a teacher. But it still happens today.",
      "author": "Amanda Terkel",
      "content": " On Monday, a conservative news outlet published what some took to be damning evidence that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is a liar: Documents showing that Warren resigned from her public school teaching job in 1971, despite her story on the presidential campaign trail that she was fired or pushed out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the end of the first year I was visibly pregnant, and the principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck, showed me the door, and hired someone else for the job,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in June. What exactly happened became the subject of intense interest after the documents went up. Warren stood by her account, and teachers who worked at the school backed her up on what conditions were like for pregnant women. Additionally, all the historical evidence of the lack of protections for women at the time make clear that not only is there no evidence Warren was lying, but also that her experience was shared by many other women who were working in teaching or other professions. CBS News pressed Warren on whether she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cfired\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cforced to resign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d trying to get the terminology right. But the exact wording is almost beside the point. Discrimination \u00e2\u0080\u0095 whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s against pregnant women, members of the LGBTQ community, people with disabilities or so many others \u00e2\u0080\u0095 doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always come with a clear-cut firing that lists the exact reason. Warren may have \u00e2\u0080\u009cresigned,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but it was clear that that was her only course of action. Employers now, just as they could then, can make workplaces so inhospitable for an employee that they essentially have no choice but to resign on their own or start looking for another job. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still discrimination; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cconstructive discharge\u00e2\u0080\u009d and can be considered the same as termination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe employer doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to actually fire somebody and leave their fingerprints on the adverse actions, so they make the circumstances of the job so unpleasant that [the employee is] left with no option other than to quit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lisa Banks, an attorney with Katz, Marshall & Banks who specializes in employment law. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe rarely have a smoking gun anymore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmployers tend to be savvy enough not to state outright the discriminatory motives for their termination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emily Peck, a senior reporter at HuffPost, said that in the 1970s, her mother used a wheelchair while working as a social worker at a college. Officials decided to move her office up a flight of stairs. There were, however, no elevators in the building. She also \u00e2\u0080\u009cresigned\u00e2\u0080\u009d her position. HuffPost solicited stories of workplace discrimination on Twitter and heard from scores of people who were either outright fired or chose to resign after their workplace became unbearable. Many requested anonymity or that their first names be used so that they could speak freely. Maggie said that she received praise while working at a medical supply company \u00e2\u0080\u0095 until she told her supervisor that she was pregnant. Almost immediately, she had a performance review and received dismal ratings, despite the top marks she had been getting previously. Maggie quickly began looking for a new job. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hard to see where the boss/owner was going,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was still super early in my pregnancy so plenty of time to come up with a reason to let me go. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmployers can make your life so terrible that people feel forced to resign because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being to set up to fail. Anybody who you want to set up \u00e2\u0080\u0095 you can create that paper trail, and people can tell that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening to them, so often they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll resign rather than have a termination on their record,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jenny Yang, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who served on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 2013 to 2018. Another woman working for a restaurant group heard a new chef make racist remarks. She notified her bosses, and a few days later, she \u00e2\u0080\u0095 not the chef \u00e2\u0080\u0095 was fired. They claimed she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cno longer a good fit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sacha said that when she became pregnant in 1999, she informed her boss at a tech company that she was pregnant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe VP warmly congratulated me and rolled right along into how my next project would be recruiting and training my replacement. I was so stunned, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure what happened next. Was I fired? Did I resign? I have no idea what HR records would reflect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Yang said that while she was at the EEOC, it would have about 3,500 pregnancy discrimination charges a year, and in two-thirds of those cases, women would allege that they were fired as a result of their pregnancy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo even today, it is very common that women experience termination when their employer learns of pregnancy. And sometimes, surprisingly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fairly obvious. Other times it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost employers know better than to say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pregnant, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re firing you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Debra Pickett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case played out far more publicly than most. In 2006, she was a prominent columnist with the Chicago Sun-Times, planning her return from maternity leave. (It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even maternity leave, which she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get back then \u00e2\u0080\u0095 it was disability leave, combined with some unpaid time off.) She wrote about current affairs, mixed with pieces about culture and her personal life \u00e2\u0080\u0095 billed as what life was like for a single woman living in Chicago. Even on leave, she continued to write her column. But during that time, she, not surprisingly, started writing about her new baby as well. Editors moved her column from the coveted spot on A2, in the news section, to the features/lifestyle section. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was a young, single Chicagoan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said features editor Christine Ledbetter at the time. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was the mantra for the column. She morphed into what she morphed into. If she chose to write about her boyfriend and her baby, those are Lifestyles topics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The final straw, for Pickett, was an assignment she was given for when she came back: to go out and breastfeed her baby in public. A photographer would come along, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d take note of the public reaction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was laughable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told HuffPost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn lots of ways, defined and undefined, it was clear to me my position was shifting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be asked to travel, even though I would have. Things were being taken off the table.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pickett resigned. She recognized that she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fired, demoted or given a pay cut. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was better to just make a graceful exit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat really felt like the only option that I really felt like I had.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This issue of discrimination is now before the Supreme Court as well. On Tuesday, the nine justices heard arguments over whether federal law forbids job discrimination on the basis of real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity. The Civil Rights Act forbids firing someone for race, color, religion, sex or national origin. The question is whether \u00e2\u0080\u009csex\u00e2\u0080\u009d encompasses sexual orientation and gender identity protections. In 29 states, there are no sexual orientation or gender identity workplace protections. Congress has failed to pass legislation that would explicitly write protections for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community into federal law. One in 10 LGBTQ workers have left a job because the environment was not accepting, according to a report by the Human Rights Campaign. One in 5 searched for a new job, and another 1 in 5 have stayed home from work because their place of employment felt unwelcoming. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOverall, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty damn common for LGBTQ people to face significant obstacles for being LGBTQ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d HRC spokeswoman Charlotte Clymer said. One man told HuffPost that for three years, he was a prominent anchor on a local TV morning show. But as people at the station started learning he was gay, things quickly began to change. The breaking point came one evening, when a co-worker saw him at a gay bar. The next morning, his bosses informed him that he was off the morning show and demoted, with a pay cut, to a nighttime reporting position. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re called in and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re told, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re off your show, and you say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 They say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to go in a different direction.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But the ratings are good, so why? And they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say, but you know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "CASA GRANDE, Ariz. (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 While President Donald Trump plays defense on impeachment in Washington, Republicans are taking the fight to Democrats in the states. Dozens of shouting and flag-waving Trump supporters gathered Tuesday at the Casa Grande field office of Democratic Rep. Tom O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Halleran, who has signaled support for an impeachment inquiry, to protest Democratic efforts to remove the president from office. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNancy Pelosi is pursuing a hyperpartisan witch hunt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward said, shouting over the chants and whistles of a handful of Democrats launching a counterprotest. Democrats can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win at the ballot box so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fixated on beating Trump through impeachment, she said. Behind her, Democrats chanted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDump Trump! Dump Trump!\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Republicans shouted back, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUSA! USA!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Arizona desert town of 55,000 is the latest front in the political war over the effort to try to remove the president from office. As Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 subpoenas fly, the Republican effort to exact political pain on those pushing the impeachment probe is just getting started. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are making hurt from Maine to California for these Democrats that want to impeach the president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rick Gorka, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign. The national party has drawn up a list of more than 60 target races for the House, Senate and governor where Democrats are running in districts or states carried by Trump, aiming to make impeachment a central theme in those races. The effort highlights how impeachment, while perilous to the president, can be a political boon to the GOP, whose voters remain largely steadfast in support of Trump. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initially resisted efforts to begin impeachment proceedings because of middling public support for trying to remove Trump and a belief it could put moderate Democrats in a tough spot. Republicans contend that despite some movement in national surveys toward support for impeachment, there are dozens of Democrats who have been made more vulnerable by the impeachment inquiry. Already, the RNC has devoted more than $2 million to an ad buy accusing moderate House Democrats of voting \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith the radicals for endless investigations of President Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promising millions more will follow. Phase one of the counter-impeachment campaign, Gorka said, has been focused on the two-week congressional recess, with a more sustained effort coming to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake sure that pressure stays on them in D.C. and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re home on weekends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cUntil they end this impeachment madness, they are going to be hearing and feeling the pressure from us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the local press conferences come in. The retail-style events are designed to energize the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core of supporters and draw attention to lawmakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stances on impeachment. Similar rallies are being scheduled across the country. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStop the impeachment!\u00e2\u0080\u009d more than a dozen Trump supporters chanted Tuesday outside Jared Golden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s district office in Lewiston, Maine. And hundreds of Trump backers demonstrated against Pelosi on Friday as she attended a fundraising event in Greenville, South Carolina. The local events are planned by the RNC, state parties and the GOP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s House and Senate arms, while the White House and the Trump campaign train most of their fire on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s would-be Democratic opponents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDemocrats know they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t beat President Trump at the ballot box, so they want to deny Americans the opportunity to vote to reelect him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn fighting against that, the campaign follows the lead of the president and the White House. The RNC is also an excellent partner and we all are working well in concert together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d David Bergstein, the Democratic National Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s director of battleground state communications, said Democrats want to make sure voters are well informed of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009crecord of broken promises\u00e2\u0080\u009d ahead of the 2020 election. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA distraction campaign won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t erase Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record: he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spiked health care costs, his tax scam will raise taxes on tens of millions of working families in order to give his rich friends another handout \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been caught asking foreign governments to interfere in our elections, which is un-American,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bergstein said in a statement. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Halleran is a former Republican legislator who switched parties and was elected in Arizona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sprawling and mostly rural 1st Congressional District, the most competitive in the state. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being aggressively targeted by Republicans who see Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popularity with rural voters as a liability for him. Trump narrowly won the district in 2016. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Halleran has offered tepid support for the House impeachment probe, saying after the release of a whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint that \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe must pursue this official inquiry and promptly complete the investigation so that Congress has all of the facts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said he would decide how he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d vote on impeachment after seeing the results of the inquiry. The GOP is glossing over any nuance in his position. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStop the madness that we have seen from the Democrat Party again and again and again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ward said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEver since November 2016, they have gone crazy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump supporters in the crowd said the real misconduct was committed by Democrats. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whole impeachment thing is a huge smokescreen covering for the sins they committed in the past,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tony Gregorio, a 72-year-old retiree from nearby Maricopa. ___ Miller reported from Washington.",

Mission accomplished, at least in the shortest of short terms. When on Wednesday Turkey attacked the Kurds, America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longtime battlefield allies, U.S. troops had evacuated from harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way. But hardly anyone was cheering the latest result of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unpredictable foreign policy. From Iran to North Korea, China, Iraq, Afghanistan and Venezuela, nearly all of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foreign policy priorities remain works in progress nearly three years into his presidency. All have been punctuated by abrupt shifts that have frustrated and alienated friends and allies, confused foes and rivals and left the impression that \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica First\u00e2\u0080\u009d really does, as critics say, mean America alone. But none has produced such speedy or potentially damaging consequences. High-profile summits with North Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kim Jong Un followed threats of \u00e2\u0080\u009cfire and fury.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Offers to open a dialogue with Iran followed the imposition of harsh sanctions. Both efforts have yet to produce definitive outcomes. Negotiations with the Taliban aimed at withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan have been hit with fits and starts. The trade war with China continues apace. Venezuela remains a morass with Nicolas Maduro still in power despite attempts to dislodge him. No such delay with Turkey, Syria and the Kurds. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s determination to pull American troops out of the Middle East opened the door to the Turkish incursion just 72 hours after the White House announced the U.S. would pull back from the Turkey-Syria border and not stand in the way. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis clearly has an immediate, sequential consequence that very few of the other decisions he has made have had,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aaron David Miller, former U.S. diplomat and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has had a direct and negative impact, although how catastrophic remains to be seen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Wednesday, Trump himself called Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military assault a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad idea\u00e2\u0080\u009d that the U.S. did not \u00e2\u0080\u009cendorse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d U.S. officials held out hope that the attacks could be limited. But the start of combat along the border marked what may be the failure of a high-risk, complex strategy supposedly designed to prevent just such an outcome. Officials familiar with the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategy say it was drawn up to try to reconcile the harsh realities of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insistence on withdrawal and Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insistence on attacking. One official described the choice the administration faced as either getting into a shooting war with Turkey, a NATO ally, or standing down and pressing Turkey hard to limit its operation with threats to punish it economically if Erdogan should go too far. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abrupt decision a few days ago to remove the American shield \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just a few dozen soldiers but, crucially wearing U.S. uniforms \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that was keeping the Turks away has been met with widespread condemnation from supporters as well as the usual critics. Condemnation from normally reliable Republican Trump allies on Capitol Hill has been notably fierce. The Kurds have accused Trump of a gross betrayal. U.S. officials acknowledge that but also say it was unavoidable in the face of Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s determination to go after the Kurds, whom Turkey accuses of being terrorists and a severe threat. Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and many national defense experts, say the move has placed U.S. credibility as well as the Kurds and regional stability at great risk. By all accounts, the Kurds were the most effective force in fighting the Islamic State in the region. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it makes it less likely that others will want to work with the United States in the future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank with hawkish views on the Mideast. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe foreign policy is not clear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rahim Rashidi, a Kurdish journalist based in Washington. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is difficult to tell who is a friend, who is an enemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The argument that the unpredictable and volatile Trump was following through on a plan put to him by experts is implausible to many, particularly his critics, who see the president as impulsive and concerned more about his own image than in U.S. national security. Democrats and Republicans alike denounced Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first announcement as reckless and self-defeating, and the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to clean it up put Trump into the role of both good cop and bad cop with the Turks. Mindful of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pledges to eventually withdraw all American forces from Syria and Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasingly vocal threats to fight the Kurds, the U.S. plan was to present Erdogan with a stark choice: either cooperate with its NATO ally at minimal cost to ensure Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security from legitimate threats it faces from the Kurds or go it alone with an invasion and bear all the consequences. After initially opting for cooperation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which meant the U.S. persuading the Kurds to move away from the border and withdraw emplacements and heavy weapons, and bringing the Turks into joint air and ground patrols and intelligence sharing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Erdogan became insistent on going ahead with an incursion. According to the officials, Trump called his bluff in their Sunday phone call. Faced with almost universal criticism, the administration scrambled on Monday to regain the upper hand. Trump threatened in a tweet to \u00e2\u0080\u009cobliterate\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy if it hit the Kurds hard and twice repeated the threat in person at White House appearances. At the same time, U.S. officials were telling the Turks through military, diplomatic and intelligence channels that any major operation against the Kurds would cause major damage to U.S.-Turkey relations. On Tuesday, Trump shifted tack. After consultations between the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon, he tweeted a friendly message to Erdogan, praising the two nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 relationship and confirming that he had invited the Turkish leader to visit Washington in November. What some saw as scattershot incoherence was, in fact, the next stage of the plan: an offer to reward Erdogan for holding back on the Kurdish operation. Critics don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buy it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, goody goody, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to invite you to come visit the White House, and whatever domestic value that has for Erdogan in Turkey, this is really dangerous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday.",

      "author": "Matt Fuller",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Perhaps more than any time in his historically unhinged presidency, Donald Trump is coming apart \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and the limitations of Congress to constrain the president are on full display. Trump is facing an\u00c2\u00a0increasingly serious challenge, with Democrats more determined than ever to impeach him and Republicans finally showing signs of discomfort. In the\u00c2\u00a0latest poll, 58% of Americans now support an impeachment inquiry, with even 1 in 5 Republicans backing the move. Support for impeachment is also\u00c2\u00a0still growing. Nearly every day since the public learned of a whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint about a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, there has been another bombshell discovery that leaves GOP lawmakers struggling to defend Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions. Trump himself seems to have settled on a strategy where he and his administration completely refuse to cooperate with Congress. On Wednesday, he ordered the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, not to testify before the House Intelligence Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation into the July phone call with Ukraine. And later in the day, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s White House counsel sent a letter to House leaders telling them that the president wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t comply with their \u00e2\u0080\u009cunauthorized impeachment inquiry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While Trump throws a legal temper tantrum over the investigation into Ukraine, he has also made one of the rashest foreign policy decisions of his presidency: pulling U.S. troops out of northern Syria,\u00c2\u00a0opening the way for the Turkish military to attack the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Kurdish allies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis incident maybe more than any other exposes this lie that there are adults in the room that are controlling him and reining him in and containing his awful impulses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) told HuffPost this week. Huffman expressed concern that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no one to stop Trump from \u00e2\u0080\u009cflailing\u00e2\u0080\u009d because Congress really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do much to check this president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongress has a limited set of tools for this situation. Impeachment and whatever spotlight we can shine on these things through investigation and oversight is about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Huffman added that Congress could try to contain certain behavior through legislative language in an upcoming spending bill to keep the government open, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just going to ignore it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a former constitutional law professor, told HuffPost on Wednesday that he really only saw impeachment as the remedy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cImpeachment is the people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last line of constitutional defense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Raskin said. Raskin did bring up the possibility of removing Trump through the 25th Amendment, which deals with the vice president becoming the president in certain circumstances \u00e2\u0080\u0095 like health-related emergencies. But the congressman noted it was a higher bar to meet than impeachment and would require the cooperation of Vice President Mike Pence. Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) also expressed concern that, short of an impeachment that may not result in his removal from office, Congress had limited tools to tame Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really no legislative way to constrain him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yarmuth said. He also brought up not appropriating certain funds, but said that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work. Trump has shown a willingness to ignore how Congress appropriates money and spend it as he sees fit, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also shown he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willing to just shut down the government. Yarmuth also brought up the 25th Amendment, but suggested the only cure was impeachment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we can move the needle even a little bit from where it is now, I think there will be Republican senators who will think twice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Yarmuth thought it came down to polling for a lot of GOP senators, who will vote on whether to remove Trump from office if he is impeached by the House. But he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior would really play a factor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf behavior hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t moved them by now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably not going to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Yarmuth mentioned Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent actions, between the Turkey decision and even a\u00c2\u00a0tweet\u00c2\u00a0where he cited his \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat and unmatched wisdom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are not things that a sane person does,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yarmuth said. The budget chairman also raised questions about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motives for pulling out of Syria, in appeasement to Turkey. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe one thing that scares me about this is he obviously has financial interests in Turkey and is doing something that clearly would be what Putin would want him to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yarmuth said, referring to Trump Towers Istanbul and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who also supports pulling U.S. troops out of Syria. The decision to pull out of Syria is particularly troubling because it goes against almost all U.S. strategic interests and leaves Kurdish allies extremely vulnerable. Trump decided to pull out after a call this month with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and very little input from his advisers. Raskin charged that Trump was only \u00e2\u0080\u009cwaging war on Congress\u00e2\u0080\u009d by refusing to cooperate with the impeachment investigation as a way to distract from his \u00e2\u0080\u009ccraven surrender to authoritarians and despots all over the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a terrifying situation to have a guy who wraps himself in the rhetoric of \u00e2\u0080\u0098America First,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 then tries to turn the American presidential election into a sewer of foreign interference and sabotage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Raskin added that Trump was only a nationalist when it comes to questions of race and ethnicity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen it comes elections and financing his campaigns, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a globalist right up there with Vladimir Putin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Republicans themselves are struggling to explain Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Syria decision \u00e2\u0080\u0095 or better yet, to influence it. One of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staunchest defenders, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.),\u00c2\u00a0tweeted\u00c2\u00a0Wednesday that a Turkish military advance into Syria would halt progress that Kurdish allies had made against ISIS in the region. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTurkey should stop immediately and continue to work with the US to secure the region,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCarthy wrote. Short of ineffectual tweets, however, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much Congress can do. McCarthy can try to convince Trump that Turkey is already going back on its word. Turkey is\u00c2\u00a0already launching military strikes\u00c2\u00a0against Kurdish forces that are close to Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s borders. But it really comes down to Trump, in his great and unmatched wisdom. Lawmakers just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a good answer when it comes to controlling Trump. When we asked Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) what Congress could do, his answer was: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI support impeachment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amash added that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if there were other remedies, because, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never served with a speaker who runs the place properly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Amash left the Republican Party in July, in part, due to the GOP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obedience to Trump, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been opposed to most of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legislative agenda as well.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cShort of articles of impeachment, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know what Congress can do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) told HuffPost on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can go to the courts, but the courts are just sort of a delay tactic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Khanna added that Trump obviously had no respect for Congress, and that his plan with impeachment and the Ukraine investigation was simply to \u00e2\u0080\u009cstonewall and obstruct.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the most vulnerable place he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been in his presidency,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Khanna said. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a true and scary statement. The Trump we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen thus far has been one who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faced no real threat of removal from office. Now, with some Republicans starting to crack \u00e2\u0080\u0095 in the words of Huffman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are a lot of new cracks, and maybe even some fissures\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Trump could act even more desperately. Ironically, because Congress has so few tools to address a president acting unilaterally and irrationally, Democrats may have an easier time convincing Republicans that impeachment and removal from office is the only answer. When HuffPost contacted Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office for comment on how Congress could respond to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior, a spokeswoman said \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe only remedy\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the one outlined in the Constitution: impeachment.",

      "content": " A jury on Wednesday convicted a\u00c2\u00a0racist former New Jersey police chief\u00c2\u00a0who allegedly slammed a handcuffed Black teenager\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head into a metal doorjamb on one count of lying to the FBI, but said they were deadlocked on federal civil rights and hate crimes charges. Former Bordentown Township Police Chief Frank Nucera was the first law enforcement officer to face a federal hate crimes charge in more than a decade. Nucera was recorded by his own officers as he went on racist rants against nonwhite citizens and declared then-candidate Donald Trump the \u00e2\u0080\u009clast hope for white people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nucera thought that Black people should \u00e2\u0080\u009cstay the fuck out of Bordentown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d compared them to ISIS and animals, said they had \u00e2\u0080\u009cno value\u00e2\u0080\u009d and should be mowed down by a firing squad. Nucera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal team conceded that Nucera used \u00e2\u0080\u009cugly, embarrassing, disgusting words,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but contended that there was no firm evidence he hit Timothy Stroye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head against a doorjamb while the Black 18-year-old was handcuffed, despite the fact that two Bordentown Township police officers testified that Nucera did just that. Justice Department prosecutors, Nucera attorney Rocco Cipparone told jurors in his opening statement, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwant you to turn criminal justice into social justice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Monday, the fourth day of deliberations, jurors hearing the case in Camden told U.S. District Judge Robert Kugler they were deadlocked on the charges against Nucera. But they continued deliberating on Monday afternoon after Kugler asked them to keep trying to reach a verdict. The case against Nucera came to fruition a few months after Trump\u00c2\u00a0joked about slamming handcuffed suspects\u00e2\u0080\u0099 heads\u00c2\u00a0in a speech before police officers. During the Trump administration, the Justice Department has backed away from investigating patterns of police misconduct in law enforcement organizations.",

      "author": "Nick Visser",
      "content": " A bipartisan group of lawmakers said Wednesday they were deeply concerned that the NBA had kowtowed to China after the organization apologized for an executive\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments supporting protestors in Hong Kong. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is outrageous that the NBA has caved to Chinese government demands for contrition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the group, which included Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), wrote in a letter addressed to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNBA players have a rich history of speaking out on sensitive topics of social justice and human rights inside the United States, and the NBA takes pride in defending their right to do so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet while it is easy to defend freedom of speech when it costs you nothing, equivocating when profits are at stake is a betrayal of fundamental American values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The letter was also signed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). The lawmakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 statement comes less than a week after the Houston Rockets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 general manager, Daryl Morey, posted a tweet in support of the democracy protests in Hong Kong, reading: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The short-lived note prompted widespread anger in mainland China, where Communist Party leaders have ignited nationalist sentiment to encourage opposition to demonstrations\u00c2\u00a0related to Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s autonomy. Morey quickly deleted the message and issued an apology, but within days China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s state broadcaster said it would stop showing Rockets games in the country and sponsors began suspending their contracts with the NBA. The team has been wildly popular in China, in large part because it drafted Yao Ming in 2002. The Washington Post noted that the NBA has since become the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most popular sports league. The NBA, which makes hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue in China, scrambled to contain the fallout. In a statement, the league said it recognized \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A separate message in Chinese went further, saying the NBA was \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely disappointed\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Morey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cinappropriate remarks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The response prompted its own backlash in the U.S., and lawmakers quickly lambasted the NBA for failing to defend free speech. Many called out Silver, the league\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commissioner, for trying to have it both ways while attempting to batten down the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business interests. The lawmakers on Wednesday urged the NBA to take action to defend the rights of its players and staff, including steps to support their ability to express their opinions \u00e2\u0080\u009cno matter the economic consequences.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They also urged Silver to call China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bluff and refuse to air NBA activities in the country until government-owned broadcasters end their own boycott. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour statements come at a time when we would hope to see Americans standing up and speaking out in defense of the rights of the people of Hong Kong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the lawmakers wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have more power to take a stand than most of the Chinese government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s targets and should have the courage and integrity to use it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read the full letter below:",

      "author": "Sara Boboltz",
      "content": " President Donald Trump on Wednesday addressed the transatlantic controversy over a U.S. diplomat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife who allegedly\u00c2\u00a0fatally hit a British motorcyclist while driving on the wrong side of the road and who subsequently fled the U.K. Emphasizing that Anne Sacoolas, who is married to diplomat Jonathan Sacoolas, made a mistake, Trump said his administration is \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoing to speak to her ... so there can be some healing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He did not provide further details. The family of motorcyclist Harry Dunn, 19, has been pleading with American leadership to waive the diplomatic immunity afforded to Anne Sacoolas due to her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position. Dunn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother, Charlotte Charles, told Sky News that her son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Aug. 27 death had left the family \u00e2\u0080\u009cutterly broken.\u00e2\u0080\u009d British Prime Minister Boris Johnson brought up the subject during a Wednesday call with Trump, fulfilling a pledge to do so\u00c2\u00a0that he made earlier in the week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA terrible accident occurred,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump told reporters gathered in the White House. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe person driving the car \u00e2\u0080\u0095 they know it was, and they have that on camera \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a young man was killed on his motorcycle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump continued, without elaborating on any apparent video evidence.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSounds like instantly killed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. The president then seemingly admitted that he has also driven on the wrong side of the road in a foreign country. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe woman was driving on the wrong side of the road \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and that can happen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose are the opposite roads, it happens. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say it ever happened to me, but it did. When you get used to one system and then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all of a sudden on the other system where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re driving, it happens. You have to be careful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some British politicians have joined the chorus of British citizens demanding Sacoolas be brought back to the U.K. for police questioning. Trump ventured that\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cfrankly a lot of Americans feel the same way\u00e2\u0080\u009d about the situation and want to help the Dunn family heal. He did not address the status of Sacoolas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 diplomatic immunity. When British police spoke with Sacoolas after the collision, she told them she had no plans to leave the country, the authorities said. Police attempted to proceed with their investigation through the proper channels by applying for a diplomatic immunity waiver with the U.S. Embassy, which would allow them to question their suspect. The embassy, however, immediately relocated the Sacoolas family to the U.S. and denied the waiver request. Per the 1961 Vienna Convention, diplomats and their close family members are not subject to the foreign laws, and the U.S. State Department said it rarely waives the privilege in cases like this. Although there was some confusion this week over whether Sacoolas qualifies for diplomatic immunity, HuffPost confirmed her status with the U.K.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Foreign Office. In a statement this week, the family said Dunn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother would like to meet Sacoolas and \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive her a hug.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe made a mistake that night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the family said of Sacoolas. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all make mistakes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

The Trump camp has been pushing a conspiracy theory for months about Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alleged corruption in his dealings with Ukraine. They claim Biden, during his tenure as vice president, withheld $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to compel the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firing of a top prosecutor in order to protect his son, Hunter Biden. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that Biden, following a foreign policy position of the Obama administration, urged Ukrainian leaders to oust the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no evidence that he did it to help his son. Despite the facts, the Times still disseminated this conspiracy theory, Bedingfield said. She pointed specifically to a\u00c2\u00a0widely criticized\u00c2\u00a0article\u00c2\u00a0published in the paper on May 1 that said in its headline that Biden was facing \u00e2\u0080\u009cconflict of interest questions\u00e2\u0080\u009d regarding Ukraine that were \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeing promoted by Trump and allies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The story, written by reporter Ken Vogel and freelance writer Iuliia Mendel, described how Biden had appealed to Ukrainian leaders for Shokin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ouster and how his son Hunter Biden had a \u00e2\u0080\u009cstake in the outcome\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that had been in Shokin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009csights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vogel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Mendel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story included a line stating that \u00e2\u0080\u009cno evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing\u00e2\u0080\u009d for Shokin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dismissal. However, as The Washington Post\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Erik Wemple pointed out at the time, that caveat comes 19 paragraphs into the story. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn those first 19 paragraphs is a knot of details bound to be mangled by cable-news hosts and pundits in the coming months,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wemple, the Post\u00e2\u0080\u0099s media critic, wrote in a column. In her letter to Baquet, Bedingfield pointed out that the Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reporting had promptly been challenged by Bloomberg News, which said the investigation into Burisma had been \u00e2\u0080\u009cdormant\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the time Biden was discussing Shokin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future with Ukrainian leaders. Bedingfield also noted that Mendel, one of the co-authors of the Times story, joined the Ukrainian government as a spokesperson for the president of Ukraine\u00c2\u00a0just weeks after the article was published. Conservative author Peter Schweizer gets top billing in the New York Times today! pic.twitter.com/dqcNamHKuc Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign also took issue with an op-ed critical of the Bidens published in the Times on Wednesday by author Peter Schweizer, who was lambasted by Bedingfield as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscredited, right-wing polemicist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schweizer \u00e2\u0080\u009chas been one of the top people pushing the claim that Biden abused his office,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Darcy wrote in CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Reliable Sources newsletter,\u00c2\u00a0adding that Schweizer \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a senior contributor at right-wing site Breitbart \u00e2\u0080\u0095 previously pushed the debunked conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton benefiting from a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpay-for-play\u00e2\u0080\u009d scheme involving uranium reserves. Government Accountability Institute President @PeterSchweizer revealed the Joe and Hunter Biden corruption scandals in Ukraine and China over a year and a half ago. The Establishment Media is finally catching up\u00e2\u0080\u0094and blocking and tackling for the Bidens. https://t.co/HIg2vxW4Vb In response to the Biden campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter, the Times defended its coverage of Biden and his son as \u00e2\u0080\u009cfair and accurate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Times\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cwill continue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy to sit down with Biden advisers anytime to discuss news coverage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a spokesman told Darcy, adding that Schweizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s op-ed had been published in the Opinion section of the newspaper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere their mission is to invite intelligent discussion on a range of opinions and ideas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bedingfield\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dressing-down of the Times follows two other letters sent this week by the Biden campaign to Facebook and Twitter. In those letters, Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team criticized the companies for allowing a Trump campaign video ad that pushes the Biden-Ukraine conspiracy to run on their platforms \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and urged them to block the clip. Facebook has refused to remove the ad, citing a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfundamental belief in free expression\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009crespect for the democratic process.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Twitter has yet to respond publicly to the request. The dissemination of \u00e2\u0080\u009cobjectively false information to influence public opinion poisons the public discourse and chips away at our democracy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo said in a statement about the ad to CNN. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether it originates from the Kremlin or Trump Tower, these lies and conspiracy theories threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections in America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ducklo added.

Trump didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t provide the title of the article he referenced, though journalists noted that conservative opinion writer Kurt Schlichter recently published a column that noted the Kurd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absence during D-day. Trump announced Sunday that the U.S. military would stand aside as Turkey moved forward with plans to invade northern Syria rather than defend the area alongside the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces. Defending his decision to abandon the Kurds, a major shift in U.S. policy, Trump suggested that the Kurds were only defending their land and said that the U.S. has spent \u00e2\u0080\u009ca tremendous amount of money\u00e2\u0080\u009d to help Kurdish forces. Trump also told reporters:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith all of that being said, we like the Kurds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turkey moved forward on the Kurdish forces in Syria by launching airstrikes and firing artillery on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported. At least seven civilians and one Kurdish fighter were reportedly killed during the attacks. In response to the strikes, Trump denounced Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offensive and said that the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Earlier this week, he threatened to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctotally destroy and obliterate\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy if the country took any action that was \u00e2\u0080\u009coff limits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Travis Waldron",
      "content": " The fight to improve compensation and labor rights for college athletes has reached the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, thanks to the only candidate who was a major college athlete himself. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who played college football at Stanford University, on Thursday unveiled a sweeping plan that his campaign called an effort to \u00e2\u0080\u009cend exploitation in sports,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for college athletes, professional cheerleaders\u00c2\u00a0and women in sports at the professional and amateur levels alike. As part of his plan, Booker pledged to back legislation in Congress that would allow all college athletes to earn money from their names, images and likenesses. That would provide a federal solution to an issue that has roiled major college sports for a decade, ever since former UCLA basketball player Ed O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Bannon sued the NCAA for similar rights to profit from the money his name and image generated for his school and others. Such legislation would expand on a bill California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed into law last week. That law requires California schools to allow athletes to profit from their names, images and likenesses \u00e2\u0080\u0095 through product endorsements and advertisements \u00e2\u0080\u0095 starting in 2023, making it the first state to guarantee college athletes such rights. For Booker, though, the name, image and likeness issue could only mark the beginning of his efforts to reshape college sports. Part of his detailed plan calls for establishing a federal commission that would oversee sports in the U.S., a promise likely to set off alarm bells at the NCAA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Indianapolis headquarters. As president, the document states, Booker \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould instruct federal antitrust agencies to use all of the enforcement tools at their disposal, including investigations and weighing in on key cases with [friend of the court] briefs, to crack down on practices that exploit and harm athletes in college and professional sports.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That pledge \u00e2\u0080\u0095 if Booker were to follow through on it \u00e2\u0080\u0095 could drastically alter the landscape of college sports, and send the NCAA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anachronistic version of \u00e2\u0080\u009camateurism\u00e2\u0080\u009d the way of the Wing-T\u00c2\u00a0formation used in old-fashioned football games. A number of lawyers, athletes and reformists have long seen antitrust law as the best legal avenue for winning wholesale change to the NCAA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s model\u00c2\u00a0and providing the compensation and labor rights for the athletes that lawmakers like Booker increasingly believe they deserve. Their basic argument \u00e2\u0080\u0095 that the NCAA and its member schools have illegally conspired to artificially suppress the market value of college athletes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 labor \u00e2\u0080\u0095 has found a receptive audience in federal courts, which have repeatedly found the NCAA in violation of antitrust laws. But judges have also stopped short of overhauling the NCAA, and have instead relied on piecemeal changes that leave amateurism altered but largely intact. Federal law enforcement agencies like the Department of Justice and FBI have also been loathe to use antitrust law against the NCAA, even when the opportunity has presented itself. The government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent landmark case against alleged corruption in college basketball, for instance, offered a prime opportunity for the federal agencies to go after the NCAA on antitrust grounds. Instead, they effectively took the side of the NCAA and its member universities and merely played whack-a-mole against the black market the NCAA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own rules has created. Booker, though, seems willing to change that calculus. The DOJ has threatened the NCAA with antitrust scrutiny before, and the mere possibility that the feds might be serious has led to immediate rule changes to benefit athletes. No major antitrust cases face the NCAA at present, but labor lawyers who have argued the biggest previous cases on the amateurism issue haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t closed the door on future legal action. A president ready to back an antitrust fight, or even lead one, against the NCAA could hasten the sort of large-scale reform that many see as inevitable. That sort of reform, to the NCAA and other powerful governing bodies that oversee sports in the U.S., is central to Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broader plan to alter the world of athletics as president. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fight he sees as linked to the larger discussions of economic exploitation, gender discrimination and social justice causes that have been central to the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe systemic problems in sports are issues of economic justice and fairness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Booker said in a statement. As a football player at Stanford, Booker \u00e2\u0080\u009cwitnessed firsthand how college athletics uses free and cheap labor to extract value from young people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly Black men, who make up a disproportionate share of athletes in revenue-generating sports \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to the tune of billions of dollars in profits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his campaign said in releasing his plan. As president, Booker would establish the U.S. Commission on Integrity in Sports and have it address many of the most controversial and exploitative practices that have drawn attention and scrutiny in recent years. Issues tackled by the commission would include wage theft, unfair labor practices, health concerns, gender discrimination and the sexual abuse of athletes that has been widespread in U.S. Olympic programs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor too long, we have allowed exploitative practices in professional and college sports to fester \u00e2\u0080\u0094 somehow treating sports as different from our broader economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut sports at these levels is a multi-billion dollar business. Just as we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept collusion, wage theft, and a massive gender pay gap in any other industry, we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept them in sports.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A litany of government departments \u00e2\u0080\u0095 including Labor, Education, Health and Human Services, and Justice \u00e2\u0080\u0095 as well as numerous congressional committees are charged with overseeing youth, amateur and professional sports in the U.S. Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commission would seek to bring them together under one umbrella, allowing current and former athletes, policy experts and academics, lawmakers and government officials to jointly oversee and reform the NCAA, the U.S. Olympic Committee and other national governing bodies in the sports world. Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan takes special aim at college sports, with compensation and labor rights at center stage. He would charge the commission with making recommendations for providing college athletes the right to unionize \u00e2\u0080\u0095 as Northwestern University football players tried, unsuccessfully, to do in 2015 \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and devising a compensation model for the athletes. But Booker also wants the commission to address other key issues college athletes have raised, in areas where studies have shown the NCAA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies inadequate. His plan would work to improve access to quality health care for athletes, particularly those suffering concussions and brain injuries; enhance their opportunities to cover medical costs stemming from sports-related injuries; give athletes more transfer rights between schools, and prod the NCAA to improve their educational outcomes. The plan calls on the NCAA and member schools to annually report data \u00e2\u0080\u009crelating to athletes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 educational outcomes, health and safety, freedom to choose their desired course of study, and other key measures of athletes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 well being\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the Department of Education. Along with its focus on college athletics, Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan promises action on other topics that have emerged in women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sports in recent years, including the U.S. women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national soccer team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equal pay battle against the U.S. Soccer Federation, the wage and hour complaints cheerleaders have filed against NFL and NBA teams, and the sexual abuse scandals that have rocked USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee. Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan also would strengthen compliance requirements for Title IX, the 1972 gender equity law, to boost opportunities for women in scholastic sports. Booker also said his support for legislation to provide federal employment protections to LGBTQ+ people would bolster efforts to prevent discrimination against them in sports. And he would crack down on potentially collusive anti-worker efforts to suppress protests from Black NFL players like former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.",

In the statement, attorneys Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid wrote that the whistleblower, who remains anonymous, has \u00e2\u0080\u009cnever worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said the person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire government career has been spent in \u00e2\u0080\u009capolitical, civil servant positions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Both the White House and Republican lawmakers have latched on to a Aug. 26 letter written by the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, in which he wrote that the whistleblower had \u00e2\u0080\u009csome indicia of an arguable political bias \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 in favor of a rival political candidate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d CNN later reported that that \u00e2\u0080\u009cindicia\u00e2\u0080\u009d was that the whistleblower is a registered Democrat, but that news has only inflamed Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to attack the person. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn light of the ongoing efforts to mischaracterize whistleblower #1\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alleged \u00e2\u0080\u0098bias\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in order to detract from the substance of the complaint, we will attempt to clarify some facts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the pair wrote, later noting that: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whistleblower is not the story. To date, virtually every substantive allegation has been confirmed by other sources.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president has moved to cast the complaint and the House impeachment inquiry as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoup\u00e2\u0080\u009d and another \u00e2\u0080\u009cwitch hunt\u00e2\u0080\u009d meant to overturn the 2016 election. He furthered those claims Wednesday on Twitter, writing that the whistleblower had a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconflict of interest\u00e2\u0080\u009d and questioning why \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis scam\u00e2\u0080\u009d was moving forward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it is important to find out who that person is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said Wednesday, according to\u00c2\u00a0Politico. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know why a person that defrauds at the American public should be protected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Atkinson himself, however, vetted the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint and determined that the claims \u00e2\u0080\u0094 centered on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were \u00e2\u0080\u009curgent and credible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A reconstruction of the call released by the White House confirmed that there were several instances of Trump pressuring Zelensky to investigate his top political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden. Bakaj and Zaid wrote Wednesday that the whistleblower had come into contact with presidential candidates but noted that their client worked in the executive branch and had met individuals \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom both parties in their roles as elected officials \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not as candidates.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whistleblower voluntarily provided relevant career information to the [inspector general] in order to facilitate an assessment of the credibility of the complaint,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote. The Washington Post reported this week that House Democrats are trying to determine what steps they can take to protect the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity, including masking the person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice and appearance from Republican colleagues when the person testifies. A person familiar with those discussions told the Post that some Democrats are worried Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies in Congress could leak the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity.",

      "author": "S.V. Date",
      "content": " ST. PAUL, Minn. \u00e2\u0080\u0095 President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wednesday featured explanations for his failure to protect Kurdish allies in Syria, new questions about an impeachment inquiry centered on his dealings with Ukraine and, to cap it off, fresh accusations of sexual misconduct. A thousand miles west of Washington, though, none of that seemed to matter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president has empowered women like no other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Second Lady Karen Pence, explaining that she understood a lot of women might be \u00e2\u0080\u009con the fence\u00e2\u0080\u009d about voting for Trump next year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe cares about meeting them where it counts: in their pocketbooks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Look at the job rate for women. You have to vote for Donald Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The wife of Vice President Mike Pence was headlining a \u00e2\u0080\u009cWomen for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u009d discussion with Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter-in-law Lara Trump and Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany on the eve of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planned Minneapolis rally Thursday. Trump in his 2\u00c2\u00bd years in office has been bleeding support from women voters \u00e2\u0080\u0093 particularly suburban, college-educated women who have historically favored Republicans. Wednesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event was among a series his campaign is planning to try to reverse the trend. Nancy Vergin, 66, was among the 250 or so women who came out to hear the trio at a meeting room at a train and bus depot in St. Paul. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur president has been exemplary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, sporting a Trump T-shirt, Trump pendant, Trump earrings and a red Trump safety vest adorned with both the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake America Great Again\u00e2\u0080\u009d slogan of 2016 and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep America Great\u00e2\u0080\u009d one for 2020. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe how much he has accomplished.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally Thursday will be his first since the House began its impeachment inquiry after the Ukraine scandal broke, which revealed that the president had asked a foreign leader to investigate his top political rival. And it comes as a new book reportedly adds dozens of names to the list of women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. His campaign has been looking for states it might win in 2020 that failed to swing his way in 2016, particularly in the event Trump loses Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, three states that gave him the presidency with a combined 77,744-vote margin. Minnesota, New Hampshire and Nevada top that list, although his campaign officials claim that New Mexico is also a possibility. Karen Pence told the St. Paul audience that they should remind friends and neighbors who were uneasy about supporting Trump because of his language and behavior that he treats his daughter Ivanka well. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe respect he has for his daughter, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amazing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pence said. And Lara Trump said their best argument was probably what the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tenure has already done for women. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you think that things are going better for you than they were, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all you need to know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A dozen miles away on the opposite side of the Mississippi River, Lindsay Nelson is precisely the sort of woman the Trump campaign is hoping to win over. The 30-year-old IT consultant was walking past the Target Center arena after work Wednesday and not planning to attend Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally there Thursday. She was, however, planning to vote for Trump after not having voted at all in 2016. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the changes in the economy have been really good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, adding that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not bothered by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controversial words and deeds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a game. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a gimmick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nelson conceded, though, that she may be an anomaly, at least in her social circle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of the women I know don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the way I do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": " Progressive Christian leaders are calling for a national day of prayer this Sunday to show support for a fair and open\u00c2\u00a0impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Ukraine. Over 100 leaders from evangelical, mainline Protestant, and historically black congregations, among others, have signed a letter\u00c2\u00a0pledging to pray on Oct. 13 that the impeachment probe led by House Democrats shines \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe light of truth\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJesus taught us that only the truth will set us free,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rev. Adam Russell Taylor, executive director of the Christian organization Sojourners, told HuffPost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe deflection, lies, and conspiracy theories promulgated by the Administration and the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most loyal Congressional allies represent an assault on truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis perilous moment calls for bold action from both religious and civic leaders who must put country and the common good over partisanship, the pursuit of truth over lies, and morality and accountability over fear and short-term political calculation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Taylor said. The impeachment inquiry is looking into allegations, backed up by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own words, that the president sought political favors from Ukraine to help his 2020 reelection campaign. Trump has called the congressional investigation a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwitch hunt\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the White House announced\u00c2\u00a0Tuesday that it will not cooperate with the probe. The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close evangelical advisers have issued dire warnings about the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts. Texas pastor Robert Jeffress suggested that America will face a \u00e2\u0080\u009cCivil War-like fracture\u00e2\u0080\u009d if Trump is ultimately removed from office, while evangelist Franklin Graham predicted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cour country could begin to unravel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the Christians who signed up to support this Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day of prayer believe that an impeachment inquiry is a moral necessity, according to a letter released Tuesday by Red Letter Christians, a religious movement that is helping to organize the event. The idea for a national day of prayer arose organically last week at a Red Letter Revival event in Goldsboro, North Carolina, according to\u00c2\u00a0Rev. Peter G. Heltzel, a professor at New York Theological Seminary who helped put together the letter.\u00c2\u00a0Heltzel said that attendees at the social justice-focused event, which was planned as a counter-rally to the Greenville stop on Graham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cDecision America\u00e2\u0080\u009d tour, were appalled by the \u00e2\u0080\u009chypocrisy of the religious right\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the impeachment issue. Leaders like Graham are mistakenly leading American evangelicals to believe that their loyalty to the president comes before their loyalty to Christ, said Heltzel, who identifies as evangelical. But Christians are called to \u00e2\u0080\u009cseek first the kingdom of God and God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s justice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this current moment, with the impeachment inquiry, Jesus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim that he is the way, the truth and the life is also a call to prophetic holiness, in the sense of both speaking truth to power and demanding that authorities are truthful in their words and actions as they govern,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heltzel said. Members of Congress invited to attend local congregations for National Day of Prayer for Impeachment Inquiry. #PrayForTruth pic.twitter.com/ZC6kgpxdNy On Sunday, organizers of the national day of prayer are asking Christian leaders to read the letter out loud to their congregations. Participants are also inviting their local congressional representatives to attend services so that the congregation can pray for them. The letter insists that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is not a matter of partisanship, but of deepest principle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nonetheless, many of the signatories are heavyweights in the progressive Christian community \u00e2\u0080\u0095 including Rev. Dr. William Barber II and Rev. Liz Theoharis, leaders of the Poor People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Campaign; Rev. Jim Wallis of Sojourners;\u00c2\u00a0Bishop Gene Robinson, the first openly gay Episcopal bishop;\u00c2\u00a0Rev. Traci Blackmon of the United Church of Christ; and Lisa Sharon Harper, writer and activist at FreedomRoad.us. Sister Simone Campbell, a Catholic social justice activist known for her work with Nuns on the Bus, told HuffPost that she signed the letter because the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cundermining of truth and civility\u00e2\u0080\u009d shocks her conscience. She said that the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cobsession with winning\u00e2\u0080\u009d makes her doubt that he will ever focus on the needs of the American people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis behavior on the part of the administration with regards to Ukraine evidences their lack of concern for the people of this nation. They only care about winning an election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Campbell said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWinning is about power, not the common good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m joining faith leaders from across the nation today to pray for House leadership & the impeachment inquiry. Please invite your Congressional rep to church this Sunday & pray for them. #PrayForTruth https://t.co/Wv9xFj3sd4 Since winning about\u00c2\u00a081% of the white evangelical vote in 2016, Trump has depended on white evangelical leaders to defend his more controversial policies and rhetoric. Roughly 7 in 10 white evangelicals told the Pew Research Center\u00c2\u00a0in March that they approve of the way Trump is handling his job. Part of the impetus behind the letter was to counter the idea that all evangelicals are unquestionably loyal to the president.\u00c2\u00a0Rev. Laura Sumner Truax, senior pastor of Chicago\u00e2\u0080\u0099s LaSalle Street Church and a self-described \u00e2\u0080\u009cprogressive evangelical,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weary of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cbragging\u00e2\u0080\u009d about evangelicals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 support and upset that people like Graham and Jeffress are seen as spokespeople for the group. Truax said she signed the letter because she wanted to show that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a broad network of people of faith whose religious beliefs have led them to a very different opinion of the president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not willing to hold him accountable to the oath of office he swore in 2017, our silence comes at the expense of the most vulnerable, of those whose truth will no longer be honored,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. The pastor said that her congregation plans to read the letter, pray for Trump and pray that their representatives will seek the truth \u00e2\u0080\u009cwherever it may lead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

The young girls asked Trudeau \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy did you paint your face brown?\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the latest episode of TV personality Jessi Cruickshank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Facebook Watch show \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew Mom, Who Dis?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trudeau replied to what appeared to be a question he expected: Oh, um, it was something I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have done because it hurt people. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not something that you should do, and that is something that I learned. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it back then, but I know it now, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry I hurt people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut did you paint your nose and your hands brown?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the girls responded. Trudeau said: U-hum, yeah. And it was the wrong thing to do, and I had a good conversation with my kids around taking responsibility for mistakes and making sure that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always sticking up for each other and not teasing each other, and being respectful towards each other. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry that I hurt you as well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trudeau added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry that I hurt kids who get to face teasing and discrimination because of the color of their skin. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not right in this country, or anywhere around the world. We all have to work together to make sure it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen, okay?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Check out the clip here: The Liberal leader, currently running for reelection, was engulfed in controversy last month with the resurfacing of old video and photographs of him wearing offensive makeup on various occasions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is something absolutely unacceptable to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in one of the multiple apologies\u00c2\u00a0he issued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is something that people who live with the kind of discrimination that far too many people do \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because of the color of their skin or their history, or their origins, or their language or their religion \u00e2\u0080\u0094 face on a regular basis.\u00c2\u00a0And I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that from the layers of privilege that I have and for that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m deeply sorry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "subtitle": "The Democratic presidential contender aims to revamp health care, tackle HIV/AIDS and overturn the transgender military ban.",
      "author": "Amy Russo",
      "content": " Democratic White House hopeful\u00c2\u00a0Pete Buttigieg on Thursday unveiled a sweeping plan to overturn institutionalized discrimination against the LGBTQ community through legal protections, affordable health care and ending President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transgender military ban. Buttigieg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy rollout, titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecoming Whole: A New Era for LGBTQ+ Americans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d proposes nearly two dozen initiatives aimed at tackling inequality of marginalized groups from the classroom to the workplace. Its prime objectives include securing passage of the Equality Act, which would remedy the gap in federal civil rights laws by explicitly banning discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation. The bill, passed by the House in May but stalled in the Senate, seeks to balance the scales for the LGBTQ+ community in all parts of public and commercial life, including housing, employment, credit, education and government-funded programs. The Trump administration\u00c2\u00a0opposes it. The plan by Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, would add a third, non-binary gender option, \u00e2\u0080\u009cX,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the U.S. passport program, following a wave of states that have updated their\u00c2\u00a0driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s licenses to include the new category. He also vows to rescind the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s restriction on transgender military service, which took effect in April. The policy bars any openly transgender or transitioning person from enlisting, and discharges those already in the military who openly identify themselves as such. According to a Public Religion Research Institute poll conducted the month the rule was implemented, 63% of Americans supported transgender military service. Those agreeing included 47% of the Republicans surveyed \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a 10% uptick from the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s findings in August 2017. On health care, the\u00c2\u00a0Medicare for All Who Want It plan Buttigieg previously unveiled would provide coverage of gender-affirming treatments and surgical procedures, which currently may not be covered depending on the type of insurer and the state in which a patient is enrolled in coverage. Though the Affordable Care Act outlaws health insurance discrimination based on gender identity, legal fights have ensued at state and local levels over the matter. Included in Buttigieg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care proposal would be coverage of pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, the drug that protects high-risk individuals from contracting HIV. Data released earlier this year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that in 2017, only 35% of gay and bisexual men at risk of HIV were using PrEP, a number the agency said was \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo low.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Overall, according to the federal government, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof the estimated 1 million Americans at substantial risk for HIV and who could benefit from PrEP, less than 1 in 4 are actually using this medication.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A major complication is that PrEP, branded as Truvada and manufactured by Gilead Sciences, can cost up to $2,000 per month. The federal government has attempted to obtain patents for the drug, spurring a challenge in August\u00c2\u00a0by Gilead. Buttigieg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Becoming Whole initiative sets a goal of ending\u00c2\u00a0HIV/AIDS by 2030. While that goal has also been adopted by Trump, in 2018, the president fired all members of his HIV/AIDS council\u00c2\u00a0who hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already resigned in protest of his health policies, virtually shuttering operations for more than a year. New staffers were not announced until March. Further signaling a lack of attention to the epidemic, the White House Office of National AIDS Policy has been inactive, having had no director since Amy Lansky stepped down in 2017. Buttigieg pledged to revitalize the office as president. The release of his expansive list of initiatives comes as he prepares to join eight other Democratic presidential candidates Thursday night for CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s LGBTQ town hall in Los Angeles; others slated to appear include former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren\u00c2\u00a0of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris\u00c2\u00a0of California. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was scheduled to participate in the forum, but canceled after suffering a heart attack last week. He is expected to return to the campaign trail soon.",

Moore just threw up a hand and said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although The Washington Post has documented more than 12,000 false or misleading claims by Trump since he took office, many of the people working with the president won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t acknowledge a single one of them. Kayleigh McEnany, press secretary for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2020 reelection campaign, told CNN over the summer that Trump never lies.\u00c2\u00a0Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, insisted in July that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe president doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make things up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even Fox Business host Stuart Varney said that\u00c2\u00a0Trump has never told a lie to the American people. Later in the same segment, Moore claimed that Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009cprobably\u00e2\u0080\u009d has a 180 IQ and boasted of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cbreadth of knowledge about world affairs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want a guy who says it like it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Moore said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd sometimes, does he stick his foot in his mouth? Yeah.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Hasan wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let the IQ comment go. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a man who thinks wind turbines cause cancer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Hasan said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThinks you can stop a hurricane with a nuclear weapon. Thinks you need ID to buy a box of cereal. Thinks England and Great Britain are the same thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Moore said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not here to defend everything Donald Trump says.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See more of their exchange below: Stephen Moore, Trump adviser: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe should stop saying things that are untrue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMe: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut he does say things that are untrue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMoore: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe does.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMe: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a liar?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMoore: [laughs] I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m never gonna say that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n*NEW* highlight from my @AJHeadtoHead interview:pic.twitter.com/X2Yo5rXQw9",

      "content": " Democratic presidential candidate\u00c2\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00c2\u00a0released a wide-ranging LGBTQ policy plan on Thursday morning, vowing to enact measures and funnel resources toward fighting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender expression. In a 12-page memo, the Massachusetts senator outlined dozens of ways a Warren administration would \u00e2\u0080\u009cfight for LGBTQ+ equality in solidarity with the leaders and organizers who have been at the helm from the very beginning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The measures include things like working to pass the Equality Act, which would extend civil rights protections to LGBTQ people, and amending the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to ensure it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be used to discriminate against LGBTQ people. Warren said she would reverse the Trump administration policy that bans transgender people from serving in the military, as well as appoint a special envoy to the State Department to oversee LGBTQ human rights. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have opposed the Trump Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shameful ban on transgender service members from the start, and I will reverse it on Day One,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the senator wrote in her plan. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan highlights the recent murders of transgender people in the U.S., most of them trans women of color, and states \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is time for a president to say their names and honor their memory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The senator included a number of measures aimed at reducing violence against trans women of color, including reversing the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal to allow homeless shelters to deny transgender people access to their services. Warren released the plan ahead of her participation in a Thursday town hall hosted by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign that will focus on issues affecting the LGBTQ community. The senator is also expected to join the Las Vegas Pride Parade on Friday. Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan comes on the heels of a sweeping climate justice proposal Warren released on Wednesday and which reads as an ambitious blueprint of how to implement a Green New Deal. Like her LGBTQ plan, Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climate proposal looks at addressing the intersections of multiple issues \u00e2\u0080\u0095 in this case how race and privilege play into conversations about the environment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJustice cannot be a secondary concern \u00e2\u0080\u0095 it must be at the center of our response to climate change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren wrote in the memo.",

      "author": "Lee Moran",
      "content": " Second lady Karen Pence faced fierce backlash on Twitter after she reportedly praised President Donald Trump for how he treats young women. Pence, who is married to Vice President Mike Pence, on Wednesday told a \u00e2\u0080\u009cWomen for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u009d discussion in St. Paul, Minnesota, that she liked Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s respect for his daughters and claimed he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d \u00e2\u0080\u009cempowered women like no other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0according to The New York Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099 White House correspondent Katie Rogers. Tonight, in Minnesota, state the campaign really wants to win, @SecondLady is on stage praising POTUS. She says she likes how he treats young women and sees the respect he has for his daughters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a mom, I was all in\u00e2\u0080\u009d after seeing how he interacted with her daughter, Charlotte. In closing, @SecondLady tells the crowd to go out and talk to a friend in support of the president, and to pray for him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid to get on your knees.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Critics were quick to call out Pence for praising Trump. They reminded her of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long history of insulting women,\u00c2\u00a0his comments boasting of sexual assault on the now-infamous 2005 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccess Hollywood\u00e2\u0080\u009d bus ride, and the raft of sexual misconduct and assault allegations\u00c2\u00a0against the president. Man, the Pences must really be worried Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either going to dump Mike from the ticket or try to bring Mike down with him if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeached. https://t.co/mV6B41RGYo I guess @secondlady missed the interview where @realDonaldTrump bragged about walking in on semi-naked contestants in the teen Miss USA pageant. You know, the recording all of America heard when it was replayed during the campaign. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how he treats young women. https://t.co/Lm2397NVyz Interesting thing to say the same day 43 more allegations of sexual misconduct against him are published: https://t.co/8twW2BOYrE https://t.co/7A0YMsmT2N This is quite a departure from how Karen Pence felt about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treatment of women back in 2016, according to @TimAlberta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reporting in \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican Carnage\u00e2\u0080\u009d https://t.co/KaZvPmXYJD This is weird on a few different levels https://t.co/9aERs1cdwH Karen loves to bury her head in the sand. How clueless can you be? Or she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as evil as the rest of them.

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve skipped the high-profile Sunday TV shows and avoided driveway chat sessions with reporters. Few who are typically eager to defend the president have appeared at all on television this month. White House officials close to President Donald Trump are pulling off a disappearing act, remaining largely absent from public view \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in the middle of the storm over impeachment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe invited the White House on to answer questions on the show this morning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jake Tapper explained to his viewers on Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cState of the Union.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u00b3They did not offer a guest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a well-worn strategy in the Trump White House: Senior officials conveniently manage to be elsewhere when major controversies engulf the building. The frequent absences of Jared Kushner, the Republican president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son-in-law and senior adviser, and presidential daughter Ivanka Trump during moments of consequence have long been a running joke among their detractors. Their detours included a trip to Florida during the partial government shutdown. Plenty of others have jumped town during tense moments. As Trump struggled with mounting Republican defections over his decision to declare a national emergency to pay for the stalled border wall, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t at the Capitol cajoling his former colleagues or in the West Wing making calls. Instead, he was in Las Vegas for an annual friends and family getaway. More recently, embattled national security adviser John Bolton scheduled a trip to Mongolia while Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in North Korea, a gesture that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit well with Bolton, who would leave the administration a few months later. Indeed, knowing \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen to be out of town\u00e2\u0080\u009d was one of the top nuggets of advice that Kevin Hassett, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former top economic adviser, said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d received from a predecessor and had to offer his successor. The White House did not respond to questions about the tactic Wednesday. But even when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in Washington, many of the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most visible officials have been staying out of public view, letting the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indignant Twitter feed and his frequent commentary drive the public conversation. That includes White House spokesman Hogan Gidley, a frequent guest on Fox News shows and the gaggles with reporters that often follow on the White House driveway. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, an aggressive defender of the president, has not made an appearance on the driveway since a highly contentious Sept. 27 gaggle in which she berated reporters and dismissed a question about whether the White House was organizing an impeachment war room. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the only person out here taking your questions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Conway noted then. She did, however, appear at an event with first lady Melania Trump, speaking with teens and young adults about their experiences with electronic cigarettes and vaping. Appearances have come instead from lower-profile staffers, including the vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief of staff, Marc Short; the acting director of Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought; and economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who tried to stay out of the controversy. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s said repeatedly that questions about Ukraine and the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to dig up damaging information about former Vice President Joe Biden are way out of his lane. Adding to the vacuum is the continued lack of White House briefings. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham has yet to hold one. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprising that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not using the many levers on the most powerful communications platform in the world, which is the White House,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joe Lockhart, who served as press secretary during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton . He said that the White House is losing out on effective platforms to try to drive its message. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody is vouching for him or validating him and filling in the blanks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lockhart said of Trump. Many aides to the president have grown reluctant to speak out on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf for fear the president will then contradict them. Instead, they allow the president to set the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message on his Twitter feed and vigorously defend himself. But one of the reasons Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment strategy was effective, Lockhart said, was that the president almost never talked about the impeachment drama. He relied on his lawyers, his communications staff and outside allies to make the case for him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be his own defender,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lockhart said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president should be focused on doing the job of the president.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But unlike Clinton, Trump has another tool at his disposal: a massive and well-funded campaign operation that has vigorously defended the president on Twitter and cut a series of ads that paint the impeachment inquiry as nothing more than a Democratic \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoup\u00e2\u0080\u009d aimed at overturning the results of the 2016 election. Another ad released Wednesday focuses on allegations against Biden and his son Hunter, which the president and his allies have been pursuing despite lacking evidence of any wrongdoing. Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communications director, said the campaign team speaks with its counterparts at the White House every day and work in tandem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt all times we take our lead from the White House,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president is our boss, and we are an extension of him. We make all of our decisions accordingly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ___ Follow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj",

In the wide-ranging interview, Conway predicted the likelihood of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment is \u00e2\u0080\u009cpretty much 100%,\u00e2\u0080\u009d gave Attorney General Bill Barr an \u00e2\u0080\u009cF\u00e2\u0080\u009d grade and lamented the GOP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lacking of a voice of reason. Conway also took aim at the people who continue to serve and support Trump, remaining silent in face of things they disagree with. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the mysteries to me about this era,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Conway said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, I get there are people who are not in a position to say or do anything there because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re junior or they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not in a financial position of comfort. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re vulnerable in some fashion. But there are people whose livelihoods don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t depend on this. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are people, for example, who are no longer running for reelection in Congress. There are people who are independently wealthy. There are people who can just go back to the private sector,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead of making all these political calculations, although I think the calculation they should be making is he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be gone at some point and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a reckoning and history isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be kind to people who said nothing or stood up for Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.

A year later, the Maine Republican is boasting about her key role in securing his spot on the bench to raise money for her 2020 reelection campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSupreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is yet again under attack by the Far Left,\u00e2\u0080\u009d stated a Collins fundraising email sent Sept. 19. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Far Left is so determined to further their political agenda, they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hesitate to ruin someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life in the process.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile Justice Kavanaugh is in their crosshairs, they are also targeting me. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I need your help right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the email continued with a link to donate to her campaign, which she has not yet formally announced. Kavanaugh was sworn in as Supreme Court justice on Oct. 6, 2018, just hours after the Senate voted to confirm him 50-48. Less than two weeks earlier, Christine Blasey Ford testified before Congress that Kavanaugh, when they were both teenagers in high school, sexually assaulted her at a party. She said he locked her in a room, climbed on top of her and attempted to remove her clothes as his friend watched. Kavanaugh and the friend laughed as he pinned her down and covered her mouth so she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scream, Ford testified. She was able to escape but the alleged assault caused emotional stress for years, Ford said.\u00c2\u00a0Another woman, Deborah Ramirez, accused Kavanaugh of thrusting his penis in her face during a college party. Kavanaugh has vehemently denied any allegations of sexual misconduct. Collins was generally considered one of three swing votes in Kavanaugh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confirmation.\u00c2\u00a0The others were Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who voted \u00e2\u0080\u009cpresent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Joe Manchin (W.Va.), the only Democrat to vote in favor of Kavanaugh. After several days of hemming and hawing, and hundreds of sexual assault survivors and their allies converging on Capitol Hill to protest Kavanaugh, Collins announced on the Senate floor that she would cast her vote in his favor, thereby cementing his seat on the Supreme Court. Her vote drew instant outrage from women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights activists and Maine Democrats who had previously supported Collins, a self-proclaimed pro-choice moderate they believed would break from the rest of the Republican Party on Kavanaugh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confirmation. Within weeks, a crowdfunding campaign raised millions of dollars toward whoever would nab the Democratic nomination in the race to unseat Collins in 2020. Several Democrats have announced campaigns, including Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon; attorney Bre Kidman; and Betsy Sweet, a women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights lobbyist and a former Maine gubernatorial candidate. Two independents \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Tiffany Bond and Danielle VanHelsing \u00e2\u0080\u0095 have also launched bids. Despite the backlash, Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pivotal vote also proved lucrative to her own campaign. She raised more money in the months following Kavanaugh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confirmation than she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raised in any other quarter her entire career, though the vast majority of the contributions came from out-of-state donors. In another recent fundraising email, Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 campaign lamented the culture created by the \u00e2\u0080\u009cradical left\u00e2\u0080\u009d that made Republican students \u00e2\u0080\u009cafraid\u00e2\u0080\u009d to express their views on college campuses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis fear comes from the same type of bullying the left sent my way after my vote for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the email sent Sept. 16. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease donate today to help me fight back against the radical left.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A direct mailer, also sent by Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 campaign in September, dubbed her vote to confirm Kavanaugh as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe right thing to do\u00e2\u0080\u009d and warned that \u00e2\u0080\u009cfar left extremists\u00e2\u0080\u009d were out for revenge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCasting that vote unleashed a hornets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nest of stinging attack ads and more are on the way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the campaign wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m asking for your help ... I really need it now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To compliment her campaign mailers,\u00c2\u00a0Collins attended a lavish fundraiser on Oct. 2 in Orange County, California, that hailed her as the \u00e2\u0080\u009chero of the Kavanaugh confirmation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked about the fundraising technique, a spokesman for her campaign told HuffPost in an email: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOpponents raised $2 million to try and buy Senator Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 vote, and they have since raised at least $2 million more off \u00e2\u0080\u0098the Kavanaugh vote,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 so this line of criticism doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even pass the straight face test.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her Democratic challengers are also shining a light on her Kavanaugh vote, hoping to mobilize the Mainers still feeling betrayed by Collins a year later. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSusan Collins still says she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t regret her vote to confirm him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d stated a fundraising email for Gideon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign sent Oct. 6. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe even said she was \u00e2\u0080\u0098sad\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that her support for Kavanaugh cost her votes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sad too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the email continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSad that we have a Senator who puts Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump before Mainers.\u00c2\u00a0But we have a chance to change that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This story has been updated with comment from Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 campaign.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Two associates of President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani are in law enforcement custody and have been indicted on federal campaign finance charges for allegedly making fraudulent straw donations and funneling foreign money to support Trump and Republican Party candidates. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who helped Giuliani investigate allegations against Joe Biden and his son Hunter, are accused of illegally funding American political campaigns.\u00c2\u00a0The Wall Street Journal, which first\u00c2\u00a0reported\u00c2\u00a0the arrests, said that Parnas and Fruman had donated to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign as well as a pro-Trump super PAC. The charges emerged from the Southern District of New York, but a Justice Department spokesman said the duo would appear at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, at 2 p.m., before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael S. Nachmanoff. U.S. Attorney Geoff Berman said at a press conference Thursday that Parnas and Fruman both had one-way international tickets when they were arrested, and that the investigation is ongoing.\u00c2\u00a0Giuliani had lunch with the duo at the Trump International Hotel just hours before their scheduled flight, according to the Journal. Separately on Thursday, House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry into Trump\u00c2\u00a0issued subpoenas to Parnas and Fruman\u00c2\u00a0demanding documents related to their work with Giuliani. Before the two were arrested, House investigators had requested that Parnas appear for a deposition Thursday, and Fruman for one on Friday, but their counsel said Tuesday that they would decline. The indictment alleges that Parnas and Fruman committed to raising more than $20,000 for a sitting U.S. congressman, and that Parnas \u00e2\u0080\u009cmet with Congressman-1 and sought Congressman-1\u00e2\u0080\u00b2s assistance in causing the U.S. Government to remove or recall the then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongressman-1\u00e2\u0080\u009d is former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), who sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking for Marie Yovanovitch to be removed as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine after his meeting with Parnas, according to the Texas Observer. Parnas and Fruman are alleged to have concocted a straw donation scheme to hide their political contributions and give in excess of the campaign contribution limits. A $325,000 donation to the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action was made in the name of Global Energy Producers LLC, a shell corporation purporting to be engaged in the liquified natural gas business, according to the indictment. Donations made to Republican Party candidates in Parnas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 name were actually funded by Fruman, prosecutors allege.\u00c2\u00a0It is illegal to make a campaign contribution in someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name.\u00c2\u00a0These donations included maximum $2,700 contributions to Sessions and House Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Prosecutors say the illegal foreign donations made through Parnas and Fruman went to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoliticians and candidates for federal and state office.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The indictment refers to specific donations to two Nevada state Republican Party politicians. State campaign finance records show the only two Nevada candidates to receive such contributions were gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt and attorney general candidate Wes Duncan. The Nevada contributions were allegedly made as part of a failed attempt to secure licenses for a legal cannabis business venture. The foreign donor \u00e2\u0080\u0095 who is only identified as Foreign National-1 and described as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cRussian citizen and businessman\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0095 allegedly wanted to remain anonymous due to \u00e2\u0080\u009chis Russian roots and current political paranoia about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The campaign finance allegations against Parnas and Fruman were first flagged to authorities by the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit campaign finance watchdog, in a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission in July 2018. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe public is now learning just how dangerous dark money can be in U.S. elections, including the potential for illegal foreign funds, which DOJ says were used here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trevor Potter, Campaign Legal Center president and former counsel to Sen. John McCain, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact that these two individuals were working with Giuliani and Ukrainian government officials to alter U.S. policy in that country will obviously be relevant to the impeachment investigation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The indictment also names businessmen David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin as defendants. All four defendants are U.S. citizens. Parnas and Kukushkin were born in Ukraine, while Fruman was born in Belarus. Read the indictment below.

This has \u00e2\u0080\u009cshocked, embarrassed and angered me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrible. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s despicable. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough words... I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m embarrassed by it and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m saddened for the Kurdish people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shimkus later clarified in a statement that while he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009casked that my name be removed from [the Trump] campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s official list of supporters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he will nevertheless \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinue to support the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s domestic policy agenda.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump on Sunday abruptly announced a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, in a widely condemned decision\u00c2\u00a0that caught his own officials off guard.

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " Rep. Nita Lowey, an influential New York Democrat, announced on Thursday that she will not seek reelection next year after 16 terms in Congress. Her retirement creates a power vacuum in one of the Empire State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe blue seats that could benefit progressive lawyer\u00c2\u00a0Mondaire Jones.\u00c2\u00a0Jones, who is 32, African American and gay, had already launched a primary challenge against the 82-year-old Lowey in July. There were some signs earlier that Lowey was trying to cover her left flank. She endorsed an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump in late July, three weeks after Jones, an impeachment proponent, entered the race. (Lowey cited special counsel Robert Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony before Congress as the factor that pushed her to embrace another investigation.) For his part, Jones had blasted Lowey, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, for backing a February spending bill that granted the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency $1.4 billion in new funding. He also faulted the congresswoman for past votes in support of the Iraq War and a 1996 law that barred the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage, as well as her opposition to the Iran nuclear deal. But on Thursday, Jones was gracious. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a trailblazer for women and minorities such as myself, Congresswoman Lowey set an example and has made it easier for people like me to run for office,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in a statement. Jones, the son of a struggling single mother in Rockland County, New York, rose from a childhood on public assistance to earn degrees from Stanford and Harvard Law. He quit his job as an attorney in the Westchester County Law Department to run for Congress, where he hopes to focus on the unmet challenges of middle- and working-class families in the increasingly diverse suburbs north of New York City. He told the regional news outlet City & State\u00c2\u00a0that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now one of the millions of Americans without health insurance, which adds a personal element to his support for a single-payer health care program like \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedicare for All.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need bold, progressive leadership in Congress: guaranteed health care, a Green New Deal, student debt forgiveness, and a full restoration of the State and Local Tax Deductions (SALT) for families in Westchester and Rockland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jones said in his Thursday statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been an openly gay, black member of Congress \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because people like me don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t usually get anywhere close. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to make history.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jones, who has rejected corporate PAC donations, raised over $218,000 in the third quarter of 2019. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over $100,000 more than middle school principal Jamaal Bowman, who launched a primary challenge to Rep. Eliot Engel (D) in June in a neighboring district.\u00c2\u00a0And nearly two-thirds of Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099 haul came in increments of less than $200. Although it is generally easier for a newcomer to prevail in a contest for an open congressional seat, Jones is likely to face a more competitive field in Lowey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absence. The district includes Chappaqua, the wealthy Westchester suburb where Bill and Hillary Clinton live, prompting immediate speculation that Chelsea Clinton, their daughter, might jump into the race. New York state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins represents parts of Westchester County as well. Her backing could give a contender an instant leg up in the Democratic primary. On its face, New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 17th Congressional District looks like challenging terrain for any progressive Democrat. It is home to some of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wealthiest suburbs, as well as its most insular ultra-Orthodox Jewish enclaves. Jones, a churchgoing Baptist, has taken steps to portray himself as less radical than some other primary challengers to Democratic incumbents. He is not endorsed by Justice Democrats, the upstart group whose support helped propel Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to an upset win in the June 2018 primary. A spokesperson for Justice Democrats didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t respond to a question as to whether Jones had sought their endorsement. In addition,\u00c2\u00a0Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099 focus on restoring the state and local tax deduction is a nod to the more affluent suburban voters of New York who lost out in the 2017 Trump tax cuts. Kristen Zebrowski Stavisky, chairwoman of the Rockland County Democratic Party, called Lowey one of the \u00e2\u0080\u009creal female trailblazers\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Congress. The veteran lawmaker played an outsize role in helping Democrats retake the House in last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election, Stavisky said. (Lowey contributed $410,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from her own war chest in the 2018 election cycle, according to official election filings.) Stavisky said she has no plans to endorse a candidate in the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary, although she described Jones as \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely impressive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099 progressive beliefs and status as an openly gay person of color, she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009care all Democratic values that we hold dear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s congressional primary is due to take place on June 23, 2020, nearly two months after the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voters cast ballots in the presidential primary. The story has been updated to note Lowey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endorsement of an impeachment inquiry and to include Stavisky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments.",

      "content": " With the House likely to impeach Donald Trump in the coming months, the focus in Washington is quickly turning to the Republican-controlled Senate, which would serve as the jury in a hypothetical trial of the president. Republican senators have been extremely cautious about the steady drip of revelations surrounding Trump and his conduct with foreign leaders, including his July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine and his public call for China to investigate Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Those facing competitive reelection fights next year, like Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Joni Ernst of Iowa, have refused to answer questions as to whether the president should be able to ask foreign countries for dirt on his political rival, pointing instead to an ongoing Senate Intelligence Committee investigation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what is accurate at this point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ernst told a reporter Wednesday who tried three times to get an answer from the senator about the appropriateness of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requests to foreign leaders. But other GOP senators who are under less political pressure at home and are more likely to break with Trump are willing to concede the president erred by asking foreign governments to target his potential 2020 opponent. They just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough of a transgression to force him out of office. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inappropriate for the president to be talking with foreign governments about investigating his political opponents, but impeachment would be a mistake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is retiring next year. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) took the same line,\u00c2\u00a0telling The Columbus Dispatch that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot appropriate for a president to engage a foreign government in an investigation of a political opponent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he, too, said he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t view it as an impeachable offense. Neither senator identified what consequence Trump ought to face for his actions, however. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), meanwhile, said Trump ought to be judged in the 2020 election, the same election Trump is encouraging foreign governments to interfere in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is, I think, latitude in our system to have errors of judgment and inappropriate actions remedied through the political process. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called an election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told The Philadelphia Inquirer. Polls have shown a remarkable shift in public opinion on the question of impeachment. Though different wording in each poll can affect results, they do show an increase in voter support for an impeachment inquiry at the very least. On Wednesday, a\u00c2\u00a0Fox News poll found that a majority of voters (51%) support Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment and removal from office, an increase from their previous survey \u00e2\u0080\u0095 suggesting the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to spin his phone call with the president of Ukraine as \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect\u00e2\u0080\u009d is not panning out. Trump still has plenty of defenders in the Senate, though. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), for example, maintains Trump did nothing wrong in his phone call with the leader of Ukraine. Graham is far more upset with the president over his abrupt decision to pull U.S. forces out of Syria \u00e2\u0080\u0095 abandoning the Kurds, whom the U.S. supported in the fight against the Islamic State, to a Turkish military invasion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s putting the nation at risk, and I think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s putting his presidency at risk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Graham\u00c2\u00a0told Axios\u00c2\u00a0about the move on Wednesday. While Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Syria announcement has elicited more anger from Senate Republicans than any of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous controversies (at the worst possible time for him as House Democrats press on with their impeachment inquiry), few Republicans have suggested any repercussions. But that changed Thursday, when Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), who is not seeking reelection, announced he was withdrawing support from Trump over Turkey. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m heartbroken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shimkus said in an\u00c2\u00a0interview with radio station KMOX. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn fact, I called my chief of staff in D.C. and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Pull my name off the I support Donald Trump list.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ... It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrible. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s despicable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

In a series of tweets, Trump said the network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pollsters \u00e2\u0080\u009csuck\u00e2\u0080\u009d and falsely claimed he has \u00e2\u0080\u009cNEVER had a good Fox News poll\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 despite regularly tweeting about favorable Fox News polls.

But Vice President Mike Pence stammered and dodged the question four times at a Wednesday press event in Waukee, Iowa. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the White House transcript of Pence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exchange with NBC News reporter Vaughn Hillyard: Q: But were you ever aware, Mr. Vice President, that interest in the Bidens \u00e2\u0080\u0095 that interest in investigating the Bidens was at least in part of the reason for aid to Ukraine being held up? Were you ever aware?

Let me very clear: The issue of aid and our efforts, with regard to Ukraine, were, from my experience, in no way connected to the very legitimate concern the American people had about corruption that took place, about things that happened in the 2016 election in Ukraine or about \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Q: But were you aware of others in the administration having those conversations? THE VICE PRESIDENT: \u00e2\u0080\u0095 about the issue that former Vice President Biden had his son on the board of a major energy company in Ukraine at a time that Vice President Biden was running the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts in Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 I think the American people have a right to know what was going on.

If Pence did know that Trump had pressed Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president to dig up dirt on Biden, that would mean he knew that Trump had potentially committed a federal crime and done nothing about it. It is illegal for anyone, including the president of the United States, to solicit anything of value from a foreign national that relates to a U.S. election. Federal Elections Chair Ellen Weintraub recently reiterated this point on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Weintraub said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is illegal for any person to solicit, accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a US election.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Watch the video above to see Pence dodge the question about what he knew.",

The article went on to say that she \u00e2\u0080\u009cshelled out $80 for a haircut and $180 for lowlights\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that a\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c20% tip would have added $52 to the bill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear why hair maintenance would be news. The outlet also clearly does not understand how much it costs for a woman to get her hair done in America, as it quoted the president of Americans for Limited Government, Richard Manning, calling Ocasio-Cortez \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Eva Peron of American politics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe preaches socialism while living the life of the privileged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manning said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing wrong with spending money to make yourself look better, especially as a personality who depends upon visual mediums for her power. But it is a bad look to spend hundreds of dollars to get your hair done to make a video decrying income inequality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Democratic socialist publication Jacobin tweeted about the article, quipping that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sad to see democratic socialists like Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo things like buy winter coats and get haircuts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Thursday morning, Ocasio-Cortez responded to Jacobin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s missive about the article with some statistics about poverty in America and how the policies of democratic socialists are not to blame. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just mad we look good doing it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote, accompanied by a hair toss emoji. Many people on Twitter were incredulous that the cost of the New York congresswoman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s haircut was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnews\u00e2\u0080\u009d: The Washington Times piece also notes that the 29-year-old \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould have saved roughly $100 for the same hairstyle at the government-subsidized Capitol Hill barbershop.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHer high-dollar hairdo stands in stark contrast to that of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator from Alabama who is a regular customer at Senate Hair Care Services,\u00e2\u0080\u009d reads the piece, which explains that the barbershop serves \u00e2\u0080\u009cmembers of Congress and the public\u00e2\u0080\u009d and charges $20 for a men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cut. Anyone who has ever been to a hair salon can tell you that a men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s haircut almost always costs less than a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, which the article does acknowledge, even though it undercuts the main point of the piece.

Two whistleblowers within the intelligence community with knowledge of the July 25 call have filed complaints against the president, alleging that Trump inappropriately pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into interfering in U.S. politics. John Bolton replaced McMaster as the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national security adviser in April 2018 after reports suggested that the chief of staff John Kelly and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, both of whom have since resigned from their positions, were preparing to move McMaster out of his post.

      "content": " The chairmen of three House committees announced Thursday that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve subpoenaed Energy Secretary Rick Perry as part of their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The subpoena demands Perry turn over several documents concerning the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communications with Ukraine and Trump pressuring the foreign power to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political rivals. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRecently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stark message to the Ukrainian President,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese reports have also raised significant questions about your efforts to press Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company to benefit individuals involved with Rudy Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s push to get Ukrainian officials to interfere in our 2020 election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter to Perry said. Perry must comply by Oct. 18. The former Texas governor became publicly entangled in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ukraine scandal last week after sources familiar with the situation spoke to Axios. They said that during a conference call with House Republicans on Friday, Trump said Perry arranged his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a lot of people know this but, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even want to make the call,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump reportedly said, according to three sources. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to. Something about an LNG [liquefied natural gas] plant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Department of Energy spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said the subpoena is \u00e2\u0080\u009ccurrently under review by DOE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of General Counsel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The White House did not immediately return HuffPost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for comment. Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subpoena is the latest the committees have issued as part of their impeachment inquiry. Others include those sent to the White House, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Vice President Mike Pence, the Pentagon and the budget office. Perry has denied reports in recent days that he plans to resign as energy secretary.",

      "author": "Arthur Delaney",
      "content": " City water systems face stricter standards under a new regulation from the Environmental Protection Agency, but they still won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to replace lead pipes. Utilities will have to do a better job of testing for lead in people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drinking water, according to the updated version of the Lead and Copper Rule \u00e2\u0080\u0095 the same regulation that failed to stop the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, in 2014. Bad water treatment decisions spiked the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water with lead that year, resulting in confirmed higher lead levels in Flint children. The government didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t admit the crisis until late in 2015. The new regulation has found some critics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Lead and Copper Rule is a step backwards and a slap in the face to the children in Flint,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said in a statement. Lead is a brain-damaging neurotoxin. It also happens to be a pliable metal that is handy for making pipes. It has been mostly banned from use in plumbing materials, but millions of buildings across the country still get water from old lead service lines that could last for decades more. In recent years, public health experts have learned that even tiny amounts of exposure can be dangerous. Many water regulation experts say the only way to make sure drinking water is safe from lead is to force cities to get rid of their lead pipes altogether. But digging up lead pipes is expensive. Flint has only done so thanks partly to a $100 million infusion from the federal government in the wake of the crisis. In a draft of its proposed regulation, the EPA said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cdue to the financial and practical challenges of wide-spread replacement of lead pipes around the country, it is important to use our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resources wisely, and thus target actions where they are most needed and can provide the most good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Instead of replacing pipes, both the current and proposed new rule tell cities to add chemicals to their drinking water to make it less corrosive and form a protective coating on the inside of service lines. The new regulation will make more cities conduct corrosion control testing. It would also require cities to take an inventory of their pipes, since many were laid so long ago utilities aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even sure where they are. And for the first time the rule will require utilities to check for lead in schools and daycares, which have been exempt even though children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brains are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday, the Trump administration is delivering on its commitment to ensure all Americans have access to clean drinking water by proposing the first major overhaul of the Lead and Copper Rule in over two decades,\u00e2\u0080\u009d EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement Thursday. Under the current rule, utilities have to replace 7% of their lead pipes annually if samples taken from people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taps exceeds a certain threshold. The new rule would require them to replace only 3% of pipes annually if they exceed the threshold \u00e2\u0080\u0095 which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t getting stricter. Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech civil engineering professor who worked with Flint residents to blow the whistle on the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water lead, said he thought the relaxed standard might actually lead to a better outcome. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoing 7% out of the blue was just considered so unthinkable that many utilities said they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather cheat and pretend their water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Edwards said. (Flint, for instance, avoided taking samples from enough homes that were known to have lead pipes.) Edwards believes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unrealistic to expect the kind of public investment it would take to fix the problem nationally. If the Flint water crisis didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it happen, what would? \u00e2\u0080\u009cLead pipes are going to be there for my lifetime and my children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifetime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou get the water you pay for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Sanjana Karanth",
      "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden told LGBTQ rights figure Judy Shepard on Thursday that passing the Equality Act would come \u00e2\u0080\u009cfirst and foremost\u00e2\u0080\u009d if he won the presidency in 2020. Shepard, whose son Matthew Shepard was murdered in 1998 for being gay, asked Biden at CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s LGBTQ town hall\u00c2\u00a0in Los Angeles how the former senator and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate would reduce hate crimes against LGBTQ people and other marginalized communities. Biden stressed the importance of passing the Equality Act, which cleared the House earlier this year. It would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to also ban discrimination \u00e2\u0080\u009con the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal is to provide anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people in areas such as places of employment on a national level. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll change a whole range of things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matthew Shepard was a 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming when he was killed, and his death became one of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most high-profile hate crimes against LGBTQ people. Judy Shepard and her husband, Dennis, founded the Matthew Shepard Foundation, an LGBTQ nonprofit that runs education and advocacy programs. Biden also said that his administration would track down hate groups and that he believes the correct interpretation of the Civil Rights Act includes LGBTQ people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a civil rights issue. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s covered by, in my view \u00e2\u0080\u0095 the court may not agree \u00e2\u0080\u0095 this is a civil rights issue protected by the Civil Rights Act,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we should be focusing on how to enforce that. My Justice Department \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and I guess any one of the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Justice Department \u00e2\u0080\u0095 will, in fact, do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Supreme Court is currently divided on\u00c2\u00a0whether the Civil Rights Act, or Title VII, protects LGBTQ people from employment discrimination. A key part of the law bans job discrimination based on sex, though some courts in recent years have read the language to include discrimination against LGBTQ people as part of sex discrimination. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answers to Judy Shepard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question were applauded, though the presidential candidate later caused a bit of discomfort in the audience after describing his first public statement supporting same-sex marriage in 2012 as when he \u00e2\u0080\u009ccame out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor example, when I came out and ... ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden said before catching himself and restarting with: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I publicly stated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cComing out\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a term often used to describe when someone chooses to publicly identify as LGBTQ.

      "content": " MINNEAPOLIS \u00e2\u0080\u0095 Jason Munson gets all his news either directly from the president or from the conspiracy theory website Infowars. He likens Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign rallies to religious revivals. He says Trump is the first Republican he has voted for with enthusiasm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the other presidents who were Republicans? They were all a bunch of pussies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the 49-year-old construction worker who spent Wednesday night at the Target Center arena to be sure to be as close to Trump as possible the following night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI get goose bumps just thinking about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The good news for Trump was that the 20,000-seat arena was packed close to capacity Thursday night with Jason Munsons from all over Minnesota. The bad news was that his cult-like followers, while a significant percentage of the Republican voting base, are likely not enough to flip the state that Trump narrowly lost in 2016 into his column next year. Even worse: Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions and words that most appeal to rally audiences actually turn off key groups whose support Trump would need to take the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 10 electoral votes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098base\u00e2\u0080\u0099 represents 40% of everyone who voted for him in \u00e2\u0080\u009916,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said former Illinois Congressman Joe Walsh, who is challenging Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat guy at the rally represents 30% of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s base.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Priorities USA, the Democratic super PAC working to defeat Trump, does not include Minnesota on its list of targeted states for next year, which includes Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida. Instead, the state is on its \u00e2\u0080\u009cwatch\u00e2\u0080\u009d list of must-win states that could become competitive, sandwiched between Colorado and Virginia. That level of relative confidence is perfectly OK with Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communications director. He rattles off the statistics: 20 paid staff in Minnesota already, compared with just one during the 2016 campaign, with the goal of hitting 100 by next autumn. The expectation of spending \u00e2\u0080\u009ctens of millions\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Election Day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a not a head fake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told HuffPost on Thursday. Matt Fuehrmeyer, for one, takes the Trump camp at its word. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to treat Minnesota like a state that we have to fight for to beat Donald Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the onetime aide to former Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota. He said that, although Democrats are focused on winning back the three longtime Democratic states Trump won in 2016 that gave him the presidency, they cannot afford to take Minnesota for granted, even if it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t voted Republican in a presidential race since Richard Nixon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reelection in 1972. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDonald Trump can lose Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania but win Minnesota and get reelected,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Munson, from the town of St. Michael, about 45 minutes northwest of Minneapolis, had plenty of company Thursday evening by way of devotion to Donald Trump. Jill Simons, a 46-year-old pediatrician, came from Edina, about 20 minutes southwest of the Target Center. She said she is not bothered by his asking Ukraine to investigate political opponent Joe Biden: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he has a right to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dustin Kluge, a 21-year-old Air Force airman who came to the rally wearing a \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpace Force\u00e2\u0080\u009d T-shirt that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign has been selling since last year, said Trump was justified in asking a foreign government for help since all politicians do it. Nancy Vergin, who drove three hours from her home in Benson near the South Dakota border, called the House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 impeachment inquiry \u00e2\u0080\u009cstupid\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said she knew it would not succeed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win at the ballot box.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During 102 minutes of remarks, Trump hit those themes and more, and in the tone that his fans love. On Joe and Hunter Biden: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHunter, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a loser. Why did you get $1.5 billion, Hunter? And your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On a protester in the stands: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo home to Mommy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On accepting refugees in the United States: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are keeping extremists, criminals and terrorists the hell out of our country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On the news media: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are very dishonest people. You understand that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On his border wall: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat sucker is going up. It is the strongest. It is the finest. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steel. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hardened concrete. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deep. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a thing of beauty. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to keep criminal aliens out of our country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose district encompasses the Target Center: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongresswoman Omar is an America-hating socialist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump even suggested that a backlash against Omar would help him win the state next year: \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is a big reason that I am going to win, and the Republican Party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tom Craft, a 37-year-old information technology consultant who most certainly was not attending the Trump rally, is not buying it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any chance he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to win Minnesota,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding that he understands why so many cultural conservatives support him because he grew up in the rural, central part of the state. But even Republicans he knows in the city and suburbs who gave him a shot in 2016 have had enough of all the chaos. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delusional.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As she introduced Second Lady Karen Pence at a \u00e2\u0080\u009cWomen for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u009d gathering in neighboring St. Paul on Wednesday, state Republican Party chairwoman Jennifer Carnahan reminded the 250 or so who turned out that Democrats have won Minnesota in every presidential election since 1976 \u00e2\u0080\u0095 but that Trump came within 45,000 votes of winning without even trying very hard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have an incredible opportunity in 2020 to turn that tide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Doing so would be a major step toward delivering Trump a second term. Trump won 36 more electoral votes than he needed in 2016, but 46 of them came thanks to a total victory margin of 77,744 votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan \u00e2\u0080\u0095 an average margin of 0.6%. Since then, a slowing economy caused in large part by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade war has put those states in jeopardy for him. If he loses all three, and every other state goes the same way it did in 2016, Trump would fall 10 votes short of an Electoral College victory. And while the Trump campaign is also pushing hard in other states it narrowly lost \u00e2\u0080\u0095 New Hampshire and Nevada \u00e2\u0080\u0095 neither of them by itself would be enough to put Trump over the top. Minnesota would. Murtaugh said the Trump campaign fully intends to win Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Minnesota would simply remove all doubt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we win Minnesota, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lights out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of course, Trump received only 2,000 more votes in Minnesota in 2016 than Mitt Romney did in 2012. The difference between former President Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy victory and Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s narrow win was a drop-off of nearly 200,000 Democratic votes. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, between 2016 and now, Minnesota has already had a statewide election: the midterm a year ago, when Democrats comfortably won both U.S. Senate seats and the governor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s race. They also easily unseated two Republican House members in the Twin Cities suburbs while losing two open Democratic House seats \u00e2\u0080\u0095 one by just 1,315 votes \u00e2\u0080\u0095 in rural areas. The main factor energizing Democratic voters in the suburbs has been Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s erratic behavior and untempered language, characteristics that Trump appears to see as a positive feature and continues to exhibit, particularly at rallies. Democratic pollster Peter Hart estimated that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hardcore base, those who will stick with him no matter what, probably represents no more than 9% of the total electorate. Hart said that appealing to that slice made sense in a crowded primary, such as Trump faced in 2016, but is counterproductive in a general election. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHard to get a majority with that approach,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hart said. The Trump campaign tacitly acknowledges that with its \u00e2\u0080\u009cWomen for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u009d series of discussions, which pushes a quieter message that essentially tells women alarmed by Trump to ignore him and instead focus on things like the unemployment rate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so easy sometimes to be a Trump supporter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lara Trump, wife of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son Eric, at the Wednesday gathering. Both she and Karen Pence told their audience in St. Paul that touting the strong economy might be the best tactic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a president that cares about your pocketbook,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pence said.",

It was triggered when Minneapolis demanded $530,000 to cover security costs for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign rally. The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign has developed a reputation for not reimbursing cities for security costs incurred as a result of his rallies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even as his campaign raises record amounts of money. At least 10 cities have complained that the campaign has not paid them for police and fire department costs, totaling more than $840,000, according to a study this summer by the\u00c2\u00a0Center for Public Integrity. The Trump campaign owes $569,000 to El Paso, Texas, for a rally there in February, local station CBS-4 TV reported earlier this month. The money represents 15% of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total debt. Earlier this week, Trump slammed Frey as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cRadical Left Mayor\u00e2\u0080\u009d out to squelch free speech. Frey replied that Midwesterners \u00e2\u0080\u009cpay our bills\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign can afford to pitch in. Yawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors. https://t.co/v1cXvoD9uR Someone tell the President of the United States that he can afford to help pay for the extra time our officers will be putting in while he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in town. https://t.co/bXITaPdW4E Frey reiterated in a tweet Thursday that city residents shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be stuck with the tab for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign rally. My position remains unchanged: Minneapolis taxpayers should not have to bear the brunt of operating costs resulting from the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit. https://t.co/qo80JKG23o",

      "author": "Nick Visser",
      "content": " A group of 17 former Justice Department special prosecutors who investigated the Watergate scandal said Thursday that they believe President Donald Trump has committed multiple impeachable offenses, drawing clear parallels between Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior and that of the late President Richard Nixon. In a\u00c2\u00a0Washington Post op-ed, the group wrote that there is already \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompelling\u00e2\u0080\u009d evidence that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions warrant impeachment. They pointed to public statements made by the president and the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s summary of his call\u00c2\u00a0with the leader of Ukraine, both of which are driving the House of Representatives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 impeachment inquiry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Constitution establishes impeachment as the proper mechanism for addressing these abuses; therefore, the House should proceed with the impeachment process, fairly, openly and promptly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the group wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refusal to cooperate in confirming (or disputing) the facts already on the public record should not delay or frustrate the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance of its constitutional duty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read the full commentary\u00c2\u00a0here. The Watergate prosecutors repeatedly compared Trump to Nixon, who resigned after the House Judiciary Committee adopted three articles of impeachment against him: one for obstruction, one for abuse of power and one for contempt of Congress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn our considered view, the same three articles of impeachment could be specified against Trump, as he has demonstrated serious and persistent abuses of power that in our view satisfy the constitutional standard of \u00e2\u0080\u0098high crimes and misdemeanors,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d the op-ed reads. House Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry\u00c2\u00a0last month following a whistleblower complaint about a call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. Also last month, the White House released a reconstruction of that conversation, during which Trump repeatedly pressed his counterpart to investigate a top political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden. The call took place days after Trump ordered his administration to withhold millions in American military aid that Congress had appropriated for Ukraine. Trump has denied stalling the funding in exchange for a political favor, but critics say his demand for a Biden investigation in the context of that withheld aid represents a clear quid pro quo. The members of the Watergate team also pointed to\u00c2\u00a0text messages released by the chairs of three House committees last week that appear to show Trump administration officials pressuring a Ukrainian official for political favors in exchange for cooperation from the U.S. government. The former prosecutors wrote that recent efforts by the White House to stonewall Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquiries should not deter lawmakers, arguing that any impropriety by the president \u00e2\u0080\u009crequires firm and resolute action.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Constitution provides for the elected representatives of the people to resort to impeachment in extraordinary circumstances showing that this drastic remedy is necessary to restrain, and possibly remove, a president who has engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the group wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLawmakers should not allow any refusal by the president to cooperate in its process to frustrate the performance of its constitutional duties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has enlisted parts of the U.S. government and key allies in the pursuit of unproven or disproven conspiracy theories, some incubated in the dark and anonymous corners of the internet. Text messages between U.S. diplomats, a whistleblower complaint and a series of public statements by Trump and other officials in recent days offer the clearest view yet of the extent to which the president has used the government to chase accusations that secret forces have been plotting against him. Much of that evidence has surfaced because of an impeachment inquiry led by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Some of the evidence that has emerged shows that: - State Department envoys in Europe offered Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president a White House visit if he promised to investigate a discredited theory suggesting Russia did not interfere in the 2016 election that put Trump in office. A whistleblower complaint by an intelligence officer suggested Trump also held back nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine as additional leverage, which Trump has denied doing. - The Justice Department is now investigating its own probe into Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meddling in the 2016 election and allegations that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign colluded with Moscow. Attorney General William Barr and another senior department official traveled to Europe in recent months to investigate the theory that the FBI investigation, first launched during the presidential campaign in 2016, was actually a plot to stop Trump from becoming president. The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tendency to say untrue things, particularly on Twitter, has caused headaches for his administration before. Until now, however, the government had largely taken pains to distance itself from such statements. As recently as last year, the Justice Department argued in a series of court cases that when it came to national security, the president did not necessarily know what he was tweeting about. Here are the three cases in which Trump has publicly advanced views of uncorroborated conspiracies behind episodes damaging his presidency. The White House declined to comment on the cases: Investigations by U.S. intelligence, law enforcement, Congress and outside researchers have all concluded that Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government was to blame for hacking Democratic Party organizations and leaking stolen emails at politically opportune moments in 2016. Russia has denied involvement, although U.S. investigators even named the Russian officers who were sitting at the keyboard during the breaches. But another view has taken hold in on some right-wing websites. In that telling, the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the DNC hired to investigate the hack, falsely accused Russia, and spirited the hacked email servers to Ukraine as part of a coverup. As early as March 2017, an unnamed poster on the fringe website 4chan wrote that \u00e2\u0080\u009cRussia could not have been the source of leaked Democrat emails released by WikiLeaks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Other posts incorrectly said CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is Ukrainian (he is a U.S. citizen born in Russia). Trump referenced that view during a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, mentioning CrowdStrike by name, and saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe server they say Ukraine has it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ahead of that call the U.S. special representative to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, suggested in a text message to a Zelenskiy aide that Zelenskiy might score a White House visit if he promised to \u00e2\u0080\u009cget to the bottom of what happened\u00e2\u0080\u009d in 2016, a reference to the election meddling. CrowdStrike said in a blog post that its finding of Russian involvement was supported by U.S. intelligence and that it never took possession of the hacked servers. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, said officials in the administration tried to dissuade Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not only a conspiracy theory. It is completely debunked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said on ABC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos\u00e2\u0080\u009d last month. Russian involvement in the 2016 election produced an investigation like few others in U.S. history, focused on whether Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign had colluded with the Kremlin to win. Another theory, endorsed by Trump, holds that the probe was actually an elaborate effort by U.S. officials and foreign spies to deny him the presidency. The FBI opened its Russia probe in 2016, after an Australian diplomat reported that a Trump campaign aide named George Papadopoulos had boasted that Russia had obtained email \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirt\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Hillary Clinton, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic opponent, weeks before the hack of the Democratic National Committee became public. Papadopoulos told the FBI that he learned that from a Maltese academic, Joseph Mifsud. Papadopoulos has alleged that Mifsud was actually a Western intelligence operative trying to frame him, and by extension, Trump. On Twitter, Trump has hinted at that theory, repeating messages asking why Mifsud was not charged with a crime, and quoting a television interview in which Papadopoulos said the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhole thing was a complete setup.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now Barr is investigating how the government opened an investigation - which went on to be led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller - that the president dismissed as a \u00e2\u0080\u009choax\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwitch hunt\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the start. Barr told CBS News that official explanations for the FBI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hang together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He has not elaborated on what he is investigating or why, but told a Senate subcommittee this year that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is a basis for my concern.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Barr traveled to Italy seeking information about Mifsud, and to the United Kingdom to meet with its intelligence officials. He has tapped the lead federal prosecutor in Connecticut to lead the review. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to pursue those conspiracies came to light in large part because an unnamed U.S. intelligence officer filed a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 call with Zelenskiy. Trump has accused Democrats of secretly ghostwriting the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint. He described the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sources as \u00e2\u0080\u009cspying on our own president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said they deserve \u00e2\u0080\u009cBig Consequences.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also said on Wednesday that the Intelligence Committee Inspector General, who first reviewed the complaint and determined that it was credible and urgent, had presided over a \u00e2\u0080\u009cscam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump also said his administration was \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrying to find out\u00e2\u0080\u009d the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity, and that he wanted to question his unnamed accuser. When the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers said a second official had also spoken to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, Trump said that person too was \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoming in from the Deep State,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a phrase that commonly refers to an alleged secret cabal within the U.S. government. One of the initial whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers, Mark Zaid, has said that Congress did not help the whistleblower prepare the nine-page set of allegations that touched off the House impeachment inquiry. Nonetheless, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies in the House and his lawyers have taken up the accusation that the whistleblower worked in secret with the Democratic head of the House committee leading the impeachment inquiry, Adam Schiff. In a letter Tuesday, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone cited this among the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reasons for refusing to cooperate with the impeachment probe. The whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s party leanings and his contact with Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u009craises serious questions that must be investigated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote.

      "author": "Paul Blumenthal",
      "content": " Republican candidates and committees who benefited from allegedly illegal donations made by two clients of President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani are planning to donate them to charity. Those two clients, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, made straw donations in the name of others and operated as a front for an unknown Russian foreign national to donate to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoliticians and candidates for federal and state office,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to a federal indictment filed Thursday. Fruman and Parnas are reportedly deeply involved in the scheme concocted by Trump and Giuliani to pressure the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic nomination. They worked in both Ukraine and the U.S., often mixing politics with business, to gather information and influence politicians as part of Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts. This plan to get a foreign government to help Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reelection campaign is at the center of the House impeachment inquiry into the president. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) plans to give $111,000 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the amount Fruman and Parnas donated to a joint fundraising committee called Protect the House \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to an as-yet-to-be-determined charity in his district. The National Republican Congressional Committee says it will donate contributions it received beyond those originally donated to Protect the House as well. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also plans to donate the $50,000 his 2018 campaign received from a shell company run by Fruman and Parnas, according to the Miami Herald. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe deception documented in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indictment has no place in our country and as a result, McCarthy plans to donate amounts received to a local charity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matt Sparks, a spokesman for McCarthy, said in an email. Starting in 2016, Fruman and Parnas contributed at least $955,000 to Republican candidates, committees and super PACs. The $325,000 contribution to America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC, made in the name of Global Energy Producers LLC in 2018 was the largest contribution made by Fruman and Parnas. The indictment charges the two businessmen with illegally masking their identities by contributing to the super PAC through a shell corporation. The indictment also mentions a $2,700 donation to Congressman-1, who has been identified by press reports as former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas). Fruman and Parnas promised to raise $20,000 for Sessions. Around the time of this promise, Sessions sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to fire the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, a major priority of Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s influence campaign. The only other contributions specifically mentioned in the indictment are two $10,000 donations to Republican state candidates in Nevada. Fruman and Parnas made these allegedly illegal donations on behalf of a Russian national who was purportedly seeking to obtain a cannabis business license, according to the indictment. The only two Nevada candidates to receive contributions from Fruman or Parnas in 2018 were gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt and attorney general candidate Wes Duncan, according to state records. According to federal campaign finance records, Fruman and Parnas also donated $100,000 to House Majority Trust, another joint fundraising committee that worked to protect the Republican House majority in 2018; $15,000 to Sen. Rick Scott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (R-Fla.) joint fundraising committee; and $53,200 to committees connected with Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign. Protect the House divided contributions to the NRCC, McCarthy and his leadership PAC and over a dozen vulnerable House Republicans. House Majority Trust split its contributions between the Republican National Committee and the NRCC. The RNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it plans to return or donate the contributions.",

      "author": "Sam Levine",
      "content": " This fall in Mississippi, a group of elected officials could block the candidate who wins a majority of statewide votes from assuming the Governor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mansion and the attorney general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office. And it would be completely legal. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because of a long-overlooked provision in the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1890 Constitution. The measure requires candidates for statewide office to win not just a majority of the vote but also a majority of the 122 districts in the state House. If a candidate wins a majority of the statewide vote but not a majority of the districts, the members of the Republican-controlled\u00c2\u00a0state\u00c2\u00a0House choose who wins the election. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote, the Mississippi House of Representatives picks a winner from the two candidates who received the most votes. The provision has received little attention until recently, when four Black Mississippi voters filed a federal lawsuit arguing that it discriminates against African Americans. Although Black people make up 38% of the state, they are a majority in only 42 of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 122 House districts, according to NPR. The provision was part of an explicit effort during Mississippi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1890 constitutional convention to suppress the Black vote, experts say, and has helped keep Black people out of statewide offices for years. It could do the same in the next election, when attorney general candidate Jennifer Riley Collins seeks to become the first Black statewide-elected official in nearly 150 years. Collins, a Democrat, along with gubernatorial candidate and current Attorney General Jim Hood (D), who is white, could win a majority of statewide gubernatorial votes but not a majority of the House districts. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unless a federal judge strikes down the constitutional provision. A federal judge in Jackson is set to hear oral arguments in\u00c2\u00a0McLemore v. Hosemann\u00c2\u00a0on Friday. The four plaintiffs in the case are longtime Mississippi voters, two of whom had to pay poll taxes and three had to pass tests to register to vote decades ago. In court filings, their lawyers argue Mississippi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system for choosing statewide elected officials is both unconstitutional and illegal because Black-preferred candidates have to win more statewide votes than their white counterparts to get elected. The provision is rooted in efforts to suppress Black people. After the 15th Amendment prohibited officials from denying voting rights based on race, the Mississippi delegates who met in 1890 sought to limit the power of the newly enfranchised black population in the state. Along with the requirements for winning statewide office, they adopted measures like poll taxes and literacy tests that made it harder for Black people to vote. The plan succeeded and significantly reduced the number of eligible Black voters in the state. Mississippi hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t elected an African American to statewide office in well over a century. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey focused on coming up with a particular means by which to achieve the goal of white supremacy without violating any federal constitutional safeguards. No other state had attempted that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Winkle III, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Mississippi. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way the law was set in 1890, and it was clearly the product of the white supremacy overtones of the entire constitution itself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Over time, the federal courts and government got rid of poll taxes and literacy tests. But in Mississippi, the special conditions to win statewide office remained. Riley Collins, the Democratic candidate for attorney general, said it was obvious the provision in the state Constitution was only about race. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe crafters of that provision indicated that this was about limiting the power of Black [elected officials]. And so for someone to later try to be revisionist in history is not reading \u00e2\u0080\u0095 they are not reading what the crafters themselves said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in an interview with HuffPost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can deny it all day \u00e2\u0080\u0095 it is what it is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even though the constitutional provision is obviously racist, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone unnoticed because it simply hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come into play in elections, Winkle said. One exception came in 1999, when none of the candidates running for governor won a majority of the vote. Lawmakers in the Mississippi House, then controlled by Democrats, chose the Democratic candidate, who was the one who had also earned the most votes in the election. The four plaintiffs seeking to overturn the provision argued the Mississippi Constitution establishes a structure that makes it harder for them to elect a candidate of their choice. They say the system denies them the opportunity to participate in the political process on equal ground with white people, regardless of which candidate wins an election. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Popular-Vote Rule ensures that even when African-American-preferred candidates generate enough support to win a plurality of votes, they are unlikely to be elected,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote in the complaint they filed in May. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe House-Vote Rule ... thwarts the election of an African-American-preferred candidate by removing the selection of candidates for statewide office from the hands of the electorate and places the decision with the House, where African Americans have little influence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lawyers representing the defendants, Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann and House Speaker Philip Gunn, both Republicans, conceded in their own court filings that the law has a discriminatory origin. But, they argue, the plaintiffs in the case are really claiming discrimination based on their political party, not race. The four Mississippi voters, they say, have not suffered any harm because the Mississippi Constitution has never prevented an \u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0099African-American-preferred\u00c2\u00a0candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099 who won the popular vote from taking office.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeither the Speaker nor the Secretary wish to defend the motivations behind a law\u00c2\u00a0allegedly enacted with racial animus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the lawyers for state officials wrote in a July filing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever, both the allegations in the Complaint and the timing of its filing demonstrate that this lawsuit is not about race, and it is not about vindicating alleged wrongs to Plaintiffs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights to vote \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about partisan politics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hood, the gubernatorial candidate, said politicians in the Mississippi Legislature shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t decide who the next governor of Mississippi will be. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe candidate with the most votes should win, period. Every Mississippian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vote should count. Those voters, not partisan politicians, should decide who they want to be their governor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hood said in a statement. The suit is being backed by the Mississippi Center for Justice and the National Redistricting Foundation, which is affiliated with the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.",

      "content": " Rudy Giuliani was reportedly planning to leave Thursday for Vienna, Austria, a day after two business associates who helped him with his dealings with Ukraine officials were arrested as they were headed to the same destination. The Atlantic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Elaina Plott reported that Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal attorney, told her he would not be able to meet Thursday evening for an interview because he was planning to fly to Vienna in the evening. Giuliani told that to the reporter around the same time that his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested at Dulles International Airport while waiting to board a flight to Vienna with one-way international tickets Wednesday night, Plott wrote. Scoop: Rudy Giuliani was also planning to head to Vienna tonight\u00e2\u0080\u0094one day after Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were trying to do the same with one-way tickets. https://t.co/e4lJr6V3Z5 Parnas and Fruman were headed to Vienna when they were arrested, The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier Thursday. The Southern District of New York indicted the two Soviet-born Florida businessmen on federal campaign finance charges for allegedly channeling foreign money and making fraudulent straw donations in order to hide their political contributions and give in excess of campaign contribution limits to Trump and other Republican candidates. According to Plott, Giuliani texted her late Thursday afternoon declining to comment on why Parnas and Fruman were headed to Vienna, and why he was planning to be there 24 hours later. In comments to the Journal, Giuliani said that while Parnas and Fruman were going to Vienna on issues \u00e2\u0080\u009crelated to their business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he was only going to meet with them when they returned to Washington. As the Journal reported, the two men have introduced Giuliani to multiple current and former Ukrainian prosecutors to discuss his attempts at getting the country to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president about such an investigation is at the center of a House impeachment inquiry into him. Separately, House Democrats leading the inquiry issued subpoenas on Thursday to Parnas and Fruman for documents related to their work with Giuliani. Before their arrest, the House requested that Parnas appear for a deposition on Thursday and Fruman on Friday; their counsel declined the request earlier this week. Jay Sekulow, another of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyers, told reporters on Thursday that Trump has nothing to do with the businessmen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign finance schemes. Trump himself told reporters he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u009cknow those gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but that \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible I have a picture with them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked about two men with ties to Rudy Giuliani arrested earlier today, Pres.

They were indicted on federal campaign finance charges that allege they conspired to funnel foreign money to pro-Trump and Republican groups and filed false disclosures about the hundreds of thousands of dollars in political contributions. Parnas and Fruman introduced Giuliani to top Ukrainian political circles, according to multiple\u00c2\u00a0reports.\u00c2\u00a0And Parnas told the Miami Herald\u00c2\u00a0last month that he provided the Trump administration with information on alleged wrongdoing by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2020 rival\u00c2\u00a0Joe Biden\u00c2\u00a0and his son Hunter Biden, via his friendship with Giuliani. When quizzed by reporters on his relationship with the pair following their arrest Thursday, the president was on the defensive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know those gentlemen. Now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody, I have a picture with everybody here, but somebody said there may be a picture or something at a fundraiser or somewhere, but I have pictures with everybody. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anybody I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have pictures with,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as seen in a clip posted by ABC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know them, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about them, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what they do, but, uh, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, maybe they were clients of Rudy, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to ask Rudy. I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Images of Trump with the pair have since been circulated. One image, posted on Facebook by Parnas in May 2018, shows the businessman with Trump at the White House. He thanked the president for an \u00e2\u0080\u009cincredible dinner and even better conversation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parnas, Fruman, Giuliani and Trump are pictured together in an undated image published by the Miami Herald. Vice President Mike Pence was also pictured with the four of them at the event. Another image posted on Facebook by Parnas, also in May 2018, was captioned \u00e2\u0080\u009cpower breakfast !!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and included a #Trump2020 hashtag. The photo shows Donald Trump Jr. with Fruman and Parnas at the Beverly Hills Polo Lounge. According to the indictment, Parnas and Fruman made a $325,000 contribution to an independent expenditure committee in May 2018 and falsely reported the source of the funds. The committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name was not disclosed in the indictment, but it has been identified as America First Action, a group that supports pro-Trump political candidates. Some on social media were not satisfied with Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s umbrella disclaimer that he did not know the pair but might have pictures with them, and some were quick to call out Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hypocritical\u00c2\u00a0attack on former Vice President Joe Biden\u00c2\u00a0last week. The president had tweeted a doctored version of Nickelback\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at This Photograph\u00e2\u0080\u009d music video, which had been edited to include an old image of Joe Biden and his son alongside two associates, one of whom had been labeled as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cUkrainian gas exec.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The man was an American business partner of Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and the two sat on the same board of a gas company in Ukraine. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attack was meant to highlight Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assertion he was not involved with his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business dealings in Ukraine. The Nickelback meme was quickly turned around on Trump Thursday:",

The 2020 Democrat, who is the first openly gay man to run for president, was asked at the town hall hosted by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign what he would do about the Food and Drug Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood donation policy that prohibits cis men who have had sex with cis men in the past 12 months from giving blood. Buttigieg responded by speaking about his own experience as a gay man leading South Bend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual blood drive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember the moment when I realized that, unlike most initiatives that I spearhead, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lead by example on this one, because my blood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not welcome in this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not based on science; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on prejudice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pete Buttigieg on the prohibition on gay men donating blood: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy blood is not welcome in this country.

Buttigieg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming out experience happened after he came back from deployment in Afghanistan and when he had already been elected mayor, he said. The 37-year-old Indiana native told his story of coming out at last month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic debate, marking the first time in American history that the public had heard a presidential candidate openly talk about their coming out experience. Cooper asked Buttigieg on Thursday what his earlier years were like when he first realizing he was gay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat it was like was a Civil War. Because I knew I was different, long before I was ready to say that I was gay. And long before I was able to acknowledge that that was something that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have power over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d @PeteButtigieg on his process of coming out #EqualityTownHall pic.twitter.com/mptCaWFkfO \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat it was like was a civil war, because I knew I was different long before I was ready to say that I was gay and long before I was able to acknowledge that that was something that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have power over,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he responded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI so admire people who are coming out at young ages but also recognize that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no right age or right way or right time to come out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think people are ready when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready. And for me, I was well into my 20s before I was really ready to say even to myself that I was gay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Buttigieg has previously talked about his \u00e2\u0080\u009cinternal war,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his journey toward accepting and being proud of his sexuality.

      "content": "WASHINGTON/BEIJING, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The United States and China agreed on Friday to the first phase of a trade deal covering agricultural purchases, currency and some aspects of intellectual property protections, and averting a threatened tariff hike, but President Donald Trump said more needed to be negotiated. The preliminary, partial deal was the biggest step toward resolving a 15-month tariff war between the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two largest economies that has roiled financial markets, disrupted manufacturing and has slowed global growth. Trump told reporters at the White House that the two sides are very close to ending the trade war and it will take up to five weeks to get the deal written. He spoke after talks withChinese Vice Premier Liu He. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters Trump had agreed not to proceed with a hike in tariffs to 30% from 25%on about $250 billion in Chinese goods that was supposed to have gone into effect on Tuesday. But Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Trump had not made a decision about tariffs that were subject to go into effect in December. Major U.S. stock indexes, which were trading sharply higher on hopes of some sort of a deal, pared some of the gains after the announcement, with the S&P 500 index up about 1.4%.

      "content": " President Donald Trump went on a political rampage against anyone and everyone in his path during a campaign rally in Minneapolis on Thursday night, calling the impeachment inquiry into his behavior \u00e2\u0080\u009cinsane\u00e2\u0080\u009d while lobbing a stream of unfounded conspiracy theories and vicious insults against many of his Democratic critics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom day one, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election, the election of 2016. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not getting very far,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Trump, who spent a majority of the rally going off-script. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want to erase your vote like it never existed, they want to erase your voice and they want to erase your future. But they will fail because in America the people rule again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event was the first since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opened a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 call with the leader of Ukraine. During the conversation, Trump repeatedly pressed his counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate one of his prime political rivals, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden. Trump has maintained he did nothing wrong and has vehemently rejected assertions that he asked for a quid pro quo\u00c2\u00a0for releasing already-appropriated military aid to Ukraine. The president continued to attack the Bidens on Thursday, saying, without evidence, that they \u00e2\u0080\u009cgot rich\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009csold out America\u00e2\u0080\u009d during the last administration. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company for a five-year period that ended in early 2019, but neither Biden has been accused of any wrongdoing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was never considered smart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said of Joe Biden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said to a cheering crowd. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden, who spent the evening at a Human Rights Campaign event focused on LGBTQ issues, decried Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message later that evening, saying America was \u00e2\u0080\u009cso much stronger than your weakness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump also took aim at Pelosi, a frequent target of his ire, saying she was \u00e2\u0080\u009ceither really stupid\u00e2\u0080\u009d or had \u00e2\u0080\u009creally lost it\u00e2\u0080\u009d when she announced the impeachment inquiry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOr maybe there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a certain dishonesty in there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. During one of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more venomous attacks, Trump took aim at Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar (D), calling her an \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica-hating socialist\u00e2\u0080\u009d who was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisgrace to our country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very angry at you people right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said of the freshman congresswoman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that I am going to win and the Republican Party is going to win Minnesota.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump regularly turned from the teleprompter during the event, saying it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cmuch better when I go off-script.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During one such instance, he also acted out a bizarre conversation between former FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page. Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally was emblematic of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest attempts to turn the momentum behind the impeachment inquiry to favor his own political agenda. The White House has refused to comply with the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigations, and the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign has been fundraising en masse since Pelosi first announced the impeachment proceedings. House Democrats, however, have remained undeterred, firing off subpoenas targeting many current and former Trump administration officials while telling the president that no one is above the law.

The former vice president made the comments to CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Anderson Cooper, who was moderating the Los Angeles town hall event, a forum for nine Democratic presidential candidates to discuss LGBTQ issues. After going on a tangent about stereotypes surrounding gay people, Biden concluded with a reflection on how the discourse about homosexuality had changed in recent years, compared with about two decades ago: \u00e2\u0080\u009cRemember, Anderson? Back 15, 20 years ago, when we talked about this in San Francisco, it was all about,\u00c2\u00a0well, gay bathhouses.\u00c2\u00a0It was all about round-the-clock sex.\u00c2\u00a0Come on, man.\u00c2\u00a0Gay couples are more likely to stay together longer than heterosexual couples,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. On a more serious note, Biden also discussed curtailing foreign assistance to countries who discriminate against LGBTQ citizens, the importance of passing the Equality Act in order to reduce hate crimes and protecting transgender people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to join the military. At one point, he referenced a time when he \u00e2\u0080\u009ccame out\u00e2\u0080\u009d but rolled with the joke and walked across the stage to put his arm around Cooper, who is gay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that would be news,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cooper joked back. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI kind of figured it out a while ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d People on Twitter were very confused by, well, all of it. Although, there was one resounding thing viewers could agree with that they wanted out of this: A remix of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgay, gay, gay bathhouses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was quickly delivered:",

Morgan Cox, chair of the Human Rights Campaign board of directors, asked the 2020 presidential candidate how she would respond if an \u00e2\u0080\u009cold-fashioned\u00e2\u0080\u009d supporter approached her on the campaign trail and said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to assume it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a guy who said that, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098then just marry one woman.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m cool with that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren fired back. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAssuming you can find one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The audience erupted with cheers and laughter: In response to a follow-up question from CNN moderator Chris Cuomo, Warren said that, despite growing up in a conservative household, she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really recall a time where she felt differently about same-sex marriage.

Warren also tackled how Democrats could expect to pass the Equality Act, medical care for transgender people in the military and correctional facilities, cost-reduction for HIV medications, and decriminalizing HIV transmission, among other topics. She had just released a wide-ranging LGBTQ policy plan Thursday morning.",

      "author": "Jessica Schulberg",
      "content": " Over the past few years, one member of Congress has stood up to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), denounced Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies, which she likened to \u00e2\u0080\u009capartheid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pushed laws that would place humanitarian conditions on U.S. military aid to Israel. Human rights advocates praise her, and she is popular in her progressive district. But she is neither the face of the progressive left nor the bogeyman of Fox News. Unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lived in Minnesota \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or read MinnPost \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good chance you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never heard of her. Her name is Betty McCollum, and she has represented St. Paul for almost 20 years. President Donald Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who loves to attack Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), one of the first Muslim congresswomen, for her criticism of Israel \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has never once tweeted McCollum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name. That the Democratic congresswoman who leads the vanguard of progressive U.S. policy toward Israel in Congress is not the subject of constant bad-faith attacks from the right is a testament to her pragmatism. But it also exposes the inconsistency of the outrage campaign directed at Omar and the other members of the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cSquad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a group of progressive first-term lawmakers who are all women of color. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRep. Omar has a history of launching virulent anti-Semitic screeds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump claimed at a campaign rally in Minneapolis on Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is a disgrace to our country and she is one of the big reasons that I am going to win and the Republican Party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attacks on the Squad, which also includes Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), \u00e2\u0080\u009care intentionally done to rile up the racist instincts of a portion of his base,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dylan Williams, of the left-leaning pro-Israel group J Street. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis double standard that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being applied to these congresswomen is very clear, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a standard that has been applied to other congressional critics of Israeli policy and the occupation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Omar, who is Black, Muslim and an immigrant from Somalia, represents \u00e2\u0080\u009ca perfect storm of characteristics that they could try to attack and portray as the problem to a white evangelical base,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Yousef Munayyer, the executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRep. McCollum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Munayyer added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit the poster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCollum, who grew up in South St. Paul, trained as a social studies teacher. After she graduated, she had a hard time finding full-time work, so she took on long-term substitute teaching jobs and worked part-time at Sears. In 1984, McCollum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toddler daughter fractured her skull falling off a playground slide that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough sand at its base. The girl recovered quickly, but the city didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything about the playground until after McCollum pushed for it at a City Council meeting \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a victory that prompted her to run for local office. She served on the City Council and in the Minnesota statehouse before she was elected to Congress in 2000. There is no one moment that prompted McCollum to become one of the most outspoken members of Congress on Israel and Palestine. She tends to talk about the conflict as just one of the many human rights crises bedeviling the world. As a lawmaker, she has shown a particular interest in policy aimed at protecting vulnerable kids: She has worked to provide HIV-AIDS assistance to orphans, prevent child marriage\u00c2\u00a0and fix crumbling schools for Native American children. In 2006, representatives of groups that provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians warned McCollum of a looming humanitarian disaster. At the time, lawmakers were preparing to vote on the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act, a bill ostensibly intended to isolate Hamas, the group that has been designated by Israel and the U.S. as a terrorist organization and that had recently won a majority in the Palestinian parliament. The bill, humanitarian workers explained, would make it harder for aid organizations to provide lifesaving medical care to Palestinians. McCollum listened and was one of two members who voted against advancing the bill out of committee. The bill, which was backed by AIPAC, passed easily in the House. But McCollum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dissenting vote set her up for a feud with one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the country. On a Friday after the vote, McCollum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief of staff, Bill Harper, got a phone call from Amy Rotenberg, an AIPAC member who had met with McCollum on behalf of the organization. McCollum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009csupport for terrorists will not be tolerated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rotenberg said, according to Harper.\u00c2\u00a0Rotenberg,\u00c2\u00a0who declined an interview, described Harper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characterization of the conversation as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cserious distortion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBill Harper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s description of the conversation with me was false in 2006 and it is false now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rotenberg wrote. McCollum was shocked. She wrote a letter to AIPAC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive director slamming the group for attempting to use \u00e2\u0080\u009cthreat and intimidation to stifle legitimate policy differences.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She banned AIPAC representatives from her offices pending a formal apology from the lobbying group. It was a lonely time to go up against AIPAC. J Street, the left-leaning alternative to AIPAC, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist yet. Members told McCollum that she had \u00e2\u0080\u009cwritten her death sentence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI went, \u00e2\u0080\u0098OK, if I lose an election over standing up for medical supplies for kids, OK, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ready to go!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCollum said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I came back, the whisper kind of was, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You can survive!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCollum never got a public apology, but she did eventually let AIPAC representatives back into her office. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bully her or do what they do to other members,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brad Parker, a senior adviser at Defense for Children International Palestine. McCollum wins reelections in her progressive district by huge margins \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she received 91% of the vote in the 2018 primary and beat her Republican opponent by 36 percentage points. She has no interest in running for Senate, she said. In 2015, when a group of activists started organizing in opposition to Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military detention of Palestinian children, McCollum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office was one of the first places they visited on Capitol Hill. Palestinian human rights is an outlier issue on Capitol Hill \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have access to a lot of offices; they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to deal with Palestinian organizations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Parker, whose group briefed McCollum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team on the issue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose barriers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist with Betty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They showed McCollum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team a\u00c2\u00a02013 UNICEF report that described Israeli soldiers removing Palestinian kids from their homes in the middle of the night, blindfolding them and taking them to an interrogation center. The kids were beaten, deprived of sleep and forced to sign confessions in a language they did not understand, without a lawyer present, the report said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wait a second. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re giving money, the U.S. government, to UNICEF, to do this report \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re giving money to the Israeli government to do the things that the report is about,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harper, McCollum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief of staff, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with this picture?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The U.S. currently gives Israel $3.8 billion a year in military aid. Since World War II, it has received more U.S. foreign assistance than any other country, according to the Congressional Research Service. Most countries that receive U.S. assistance are subject to extensive restrictions on how the aid is used. But for Israel, much of the money goes directly into its Ministry of Defense, with little American oversight, Harper said. In 2017, McCollum introduced a bill to block U.S. aid to Israel from being used to \u00e2\u0080\u009csupport the military detention, interrogation, abuse, or ill-treatment of Palestinian children in violation of international humanitarian law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She reintroduced the bill in April, this time with language that would amend the so-called Leahy law, which prohibits the U.S. from providing military assistance to foreign governments that commit \u00e2\u0080\u009ca gross violation of human rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The current bill would also set aside money to fund nongovernmental organizations that provide physical, psychological and emotional treatment for Palestinian children who have been detained by the Israeli military. Last March, the Minnesota delegation of American Muslims for Palestine traveled to Washington to meet with McCollum and talk about her bill. At the end of the meeting, McCollum tweeted out a picture of her posing with the group. The congresswoman didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think much of it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she tweets pictures of groups she meets with all the time. But Palestinian activists are used to being ignored by their elected officials, AMP chapter lead Mariam El-Khatib said. When El-Khatib saw the tweet, she thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWow, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind being associated with AMP or Palestinians doing this kind of work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The bill has 21 co-sponsors, all Democrats. Two additional Democrats withdrew their names as co-sponsors. When Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) pulled her name, she tweeted that her \u00e2\u0080\u009cheart has always been with the children of Palestine\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that she was pushing leadership \u00e2\u0080\u009chard\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a vote on a \u00e2\u0080\u009cresolution supporting a two-state solution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCollum pushed back: \u00e2\u0080\u009cRep. Dingell removed her name from HR 2407, calling it \u00e2\u0080\u0098counterproductive to a peaceful, two-state solution,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCollum tweeted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes ongoing U.S. funding for Israeli military detention and abuse of Palestinian children promote peace or human rights violations?\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCollum estimates that if all of the members who told her in private they liked the bill were willing to support it publicly, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have another 20 co-sponsors. But she also knows the bill has almost no chance of making it out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, headed by the staunchly pro-Israel Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 much less becoming law. Engel and Dingell\u00c2\u00a0did not respond to requests for comment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the obvious bill that still won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get passed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jaylani Hussein, head of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Last year, McCollum accepted an award from the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights. During her acceptance speech, she described Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nation-state law \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which reserves the right to self-determination in Israel for Jewish people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as a system of apartheid. For a sitting member of Congress to use the word \u00e2\u0080\u009capartheid\u00e2\u0080\u009d in reference to Israel is radical \u00e2\u0080\u0094 almost inconceivable. But her comments attracted almost no national attention. With the exception of fringe actors, such as Zionist Organization of American President Mort Klein, most of the people from the pro-Israel community who weighed in on her speech offered measured criticism. Steve Hunegs, of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas, expressed disappointment with her word choice and her decision to attend the event, but he also emphasized her past support for a two-state solution. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accuse her of anti-Semitism. McCollum thinks the conversation about Israel is shifting among her colleagues. The leadership of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who has vowed to annex parts of the West Bank \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has Democrats concerned that prospects for a two-state solution are disappearing. Without a two-state solution, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo we have apartheid in Israel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCollum asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo we have something similar to Jim Crow laws, which we had a struggle with in this country and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still facing the repercussions that are with race relations? Do we not say anything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The conversation is slowly shifting, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not hard to imagine what would have happened if Omar, the congresswoman who represents the district across the river from McCollum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, had used the word \u00e2\u0080\u009capartheid\u00e2\u0080\u009d in reference to Israel. Like McCollum, Omar has spoken out against the influence of AIPAC and criticized the right-wing government in Israel. But, unlike the more senior lawmaker, Omar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critics usually assume the worst interpretation of her words. In the week immediately following Omar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about the Benjamins, baby\u00e2\u0080\u009d tweet \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an observation that members of Congress are willing to infringe on Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 right to criticize Israel because of money directed their way by pro-Israel lobbyists \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Omar was roundly accused of trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes about the influence of wealthy Jews. Her name was mentioned in 21 Fox News shows, 51 CNN shows and five MSNBC shows, The Intercept reported. Her name also appeared in nearly 500 newspaper articles, according to a Lexis Nexis search. Omar apologized after the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBenjamins\u00e2\u0080\u009d tweet and said she was grateful for colleagues and allies who educated her on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpainful history of anti-Semitic tropes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Later that month, she spoke at a progressive policy town hall about her fear that her legitimate criticisms of Israel will be misconstrued as anti-Semitism because she is Muslim. She asked why she is allowed to criticize the influence of the National Rifle Association and Big Pharma but not the influence of the pro-Israel lobby. But people paid attention to only one line in her remarks: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Omar was talking about an effective political lobbying operation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one that includes plenty of evangelical Christians and is opposed by lots of American Jews. But Omar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critics, including some liberals, insisted she was questioning the loyalty of American Jews. New York magazine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jonathan Chait proclaimed she no longer deserved \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe presumption of good faith,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Engel accused her of \u00e2\u0080\u009cinvoking a vile anti-Semitic slur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Within days, the House passed a resolution condemning all forms of anti-Semitism, listing \u00e2\u0080\u009caccusations of dual loyalty\u00e2\u0080\u009d alongside the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. McCollum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staff say that the reason she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t evoke the same reactions as Omar is because she is careful with her words and has spent years cultivating close relationships in Congress, including with leadership and members on the other side of the political spectrum. McCollum works \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcruciatingly\u00e2\u0080\u009d hard to make sure that what she says about Israel is \u00e2\u0080\u009cbased on evidence\u00e2\u0080\u009d and is backed on reports, Harper said. She goes out of her way to make clear that she is not attacking Jews or Israelis, but the policies of a government, Harper continued. I asked more than a dozen policy advocates and Capitol Hill staffers who work on Israeli-Palestinian issues about the disparate treatment between McCollum and Omar. All of them agreed that McCollum is careful and that she benefits from close relationships with her colleagues. But racism and Islamophobia are also part of the reason why Omar faces vitriolic backlash every time she weighs in on Israel while McCollum has gone relatively unnoticed, almost all of the advocates and Capitol Hill staffers said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUndoubtedly, Rep. McCollum is one of the leading human rights champions on Palestinian human rights on the Hill, consistently for years, without fail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Beth Miller, the government affairs manager at Jewish Voice for Peace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact that she has never been attacked in the way that Reps. Tlaib and Omar have been speaks to the racism and Islamophobia that is very present in this conversation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even if Omar used the same language that McCollum has in criticizing Israel, she would still be maligned as an anti-Semite, Munayyer argued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can try to be as careful as you want with your language, obviously it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that everyone should be careful with their language on this issue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut when no matter what you say, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being attacked because of who you are. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not about what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about you having a voice on this issue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d From the outside, McCollum and Omar seem like the perfect duo to bring real change to the U.S. conversation around Israel: a veteran lawmaker who has goodwill among her colleagues and a fiery newcomer who isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afraid of raising hell. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople like Reps. Omar and Tlaib \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, to a certain degree, Bernie Sanders \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are bringing much-needed attention to the occupation in ways that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen before in Congress. But you also need workhorses like Rep. McCollum to quietly build consensus around legislation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a senior Democratic Hill staffer said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs in any movement, the two roles are complementary. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make real change without both an inside and an outside strategy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Omar, who, through a spokesperson, declined an interview, is a co-sponsor of McCollum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bill \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but most of the time, the two members do their own thing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIlhan is on the other side of the Mississippi River, and we talk sometimes in the break room in between votes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCollum said, adding that the same was true with Omar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predecessors. But, at times, McCollum has seemed visibly annoyed with Omar and the controversies that surround her. In March, McCollum put out a rare statement on her Minnesota colleague: \u00e2\u0080\u009cRep. Omar has the right to speak freely, and she also must take responsibility for the effect her words have on her colleagues, her constituents, and the policies Democrats seek to advance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCollum said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDemocrats have an important agenda to advance and for any Member of Congress to be successful it takes the support of at least 217 colleagues to pass a bill. No one does this job alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCollum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief of staff put it more bluntly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy own take on it is that she really derailed a lot of our work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harper said. But as anyone who has tried to talk, write or argue about Israel and the Palestinians knows, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way to do it that will please everyone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiven how detached the D.C. debate on Israel-Palestine is from the actual reality of what goes on there, there may be no way we move this debate closer to reality in a way that avoids tension entirely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Matt Duss, a foreign policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just have to do our best to be as honest and sensitive and constructive as we can, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a debate we need to have.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This article has been updated to include a more extensive quote from Amy Rotenberg.",

Trump, asked by reporters on the White House lawn if he had meant his comments in jest, replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina has to do whatever they want. If they want to look into something, they can look into it. If they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to look into it, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrankly, as far as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m concerned, if China wants to look into something, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great.

He made the comments amid impeachment proceedings prompted by his July 25 phone call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he requested that foreign government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aid in digging up dirt on Biden. Multiple Republican lawmakers, when asked if they believed Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s China comments were appropriate,\u00c2\u00a0defended them as being a joke, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio.), Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), and Rep.

      "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Donald Trump has spent his time in office trying to bend the conventions of the American presidency to his will. Now he appears to be trying to override a core principle of democracy: that no one is above the law. Faced with an impeachment inquiry, Trump has openly defied the core constructs of the Constitution. He chafes at the idea of co-equal branches of government and rejects the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to investigate him. He has deployed a convoluted logic in which he has declared that the courts can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t investigate him because as president he cannot be charged with a crime but also that Congress cannot impeach him because its inquiry is politically illegitimate. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a \u00e2\u0080\u009cheads he wins, tails you lose\u00e2\u0080\u009d formulation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anathema to his character and his life story to be checked and balanced by anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said presidential historian Jon Meacham, a professor at Vanderbilt University. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Constitution was formed to contain appetite. And we now have the president who is driven entirely by appetite.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a scathing eight-page letter this week, the Republican president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers served notice there will be no cooperation with the impeachment inquiry. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s White House has ignored document requests and subpoenas. It readily invokes executive privilege \u00e2\u0080\u0094 going so far as to argue that the privilege extends to informal presidential advisers who never held White House jobs. And his team all but dares Democrats to hold them in contempt. The impeachment standoff follows a pattern Trump has established throughout his presidency as he has jettisoned experienced advisers and flouted conventions. The fact that he survived the special counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Russia investigation without paying much of a political penalty left him all the more emboldened. One day after Robert Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faltering testimony brought an end to that threat, Trump unleashed a new one by asking Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president to investigate his political foe Joe Biden. That prompted the fast-moving impeachment inquiry that Trump now resists. After two weeks of a listless and unfocused response to the impeachment probe, the White House letter to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week was a declaration of war. While it was filled with dubious legal arguments, its intent was clear: Trump would not play ball, claiming that the game was rigged against him. As for all the subpoenas flying from House Democrats, an exasperated Trump said Thursday, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running a country, I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that you can have all of these people testifying about every conversation you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as for the Democrats, Trump claimed Wednesday they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the ones playing dirty \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause they have a tiny margin in the House.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have eviscerated the rules,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give us any \u00e2\u0080\u0094 any fair play. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most unfair situation people have seen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Constitution gives the House \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe sole power of impeachment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But it confers that authority without providing any guidelines, which the White House has seized upon in demanding that Pelosi call for a vote to authorize the inquiry as happened in the last two impeachment inquiries. No vote is required, and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategy risks further provoking Democrats in the impeachment probe, setting up court challenges and the potential for lawmakers to draw up an article of impeachment for obstructing their investigations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president does not have all-consuming power,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nick Ackerman, a member of the Watergate prosecution team that investigated President Richard Nixon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe play by certain rules, and we expect the rule of law to apply. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have checks and balances if he ignores them. That itself is an impeachable defense, which is what Nixon faced.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is unclear whether Democrats would wade into a lengthy legal fight with the administration over documents and testimony or if they would just move straight to considering articles of impeachment. Trump, for his part, has never been one to rely on legality or logic in making his arguments. In the last week alone, he called for the impeachment of Sen. Mitt Romney and Rep. Adam Schiff \u00e2\u0080\u0094 events that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t occur \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and in part justified his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, leaving the Kurds vulnerable to Turkish attacks, by saying the Kurds did not assist at Normandy during World War II. Since taking office, he has taken repeatedly taken unilateral action to defy Congress and push the limits of his own power, declaring a national emergency so he could divert funds for a border wall and taking executive action to try to halt immigration from several Muslim-majority nations. Trump on Thursday punctuated a tweet about unfair media coverage with four words that seemed to sum up his entire viewpoint of the American system: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m President!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Constitution was built to withstand tests like this. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoth the strength of the American system and one of its most frustrating aspects is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredibly difficult to do anything quickly, particularly bad things, which the founders believed would happen more often than good things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meacham said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChecks and balances were created so one bad actor could not dominate the proceedings. We now have that bad actor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ___ EDITOR\u00e2\u0080\u0099S NOTE \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Jonathan Lemire has covered politics and the White House for The Associated Press since 2013. ___ Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire",

      "subtitle": "The gunman accused of killing two people outside a Halle synagogue was using homemade firearms \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a far cry from military-grade weaponry common in the U.S.",
      "author": "Andy Campbell",
      "content": " The man accused of shooting two people to death in Halle, Germany, this week shares a lot of characteristics with American mass shooters: He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bigot with delusions of grandeur, and is part of an online community that fervently supports his hate. But one thing that set him apart \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and likely curbed the death toll in Wednesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shootings outside a synagogue \u00e2\u0080\u0095 was his choice of weapons. Police say he was armed with homemade guns that jammed repeatedly during the attack. American mass killers, on the other hand, typically strike with a cache of military-grade, semiautomatic weaponry. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in part due to Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strict gun laws. Had the Halle shooter had access to better guns, the bloodshed could have been much worse, experts said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that if he had access to better weapons, the body count would have been higher,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vegas Tenold, a journalist and author with the Anti-Defamation League\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Center on Extremism. Tenold tweeted a photo of the shooter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slam-bang tube, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a direct result of Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strict gun laws.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The shooter, in a gruesome, 36-minute video livestreamed on Twitch, used his improvised guns to kill two people after failing to get inside a synagogue filled with Yom Kippur worshippers. His guns \u00e2\u0080\u0095 including a so-called slam-bang tube and a homemade 9mm rifle \u00e2\u0080\u0095 repeatedly jammed or failed to fire as he attempted to shoot. He said he wanted to prove the effectiveness of rudimentary weapons in a country that makes it hard to obtain semiautomatic guns. The shooter in Germany used home made weapons that were low quality and misfired repeatedly. This is a direct result of Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strict gun laws. If he had had access to better weapons he would have killed more people. pic.twitter.com/Mo13zRtTJ4 Germany has some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strictest gun laws. All gun ownership is heavily regulated,\u00c2\u00a0and each legal purchase comes with a background check that considers addiction, mental health history, and criminal record. Gun buyers under 25 have to pass a psychological exam, and semiautomatic gun ownership requires special authorization. German gun laws were tightened after school shootings in 2002 and 2009. In turn, shooting incidents dropped dramatically, according to The Washington Post. Illegal weaponry and DIY guns are still a threat across much of Europe. But shooters need criminal connections to get their hands on semiautomatic firepower that is commonplace in America, said Nils Duquet, a weapons expert in Belgium with Flemish Peace Institute. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you want to buy an illegal gun in Europe, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important is having the right networks. For assault rifles, you need better criminal connections,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Duquet told The Washington Post.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there are many hot spots in Europe where you can try, and that is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worrying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gun laws, along with war-torn Yemen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, are the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loosest. The U.S. is\u00c2\u00a0averaging more than one mass shooting per day this year. According to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive, 329 mass shootings \u00e2\u0080\u0095 defined as an incident in which four people or more are shot, excluding the shooter \u00e2\u0080\u0095 have occurred in the U.S. in 2019. Military-grade, semiautomatic rifles are often easier to obtain in the U.S. than handguns, and they kill twice as many people as other types of weapons,\u00c2\u00a0according to researchers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cActive shooters are hell-bent on killing people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Adil Haider, a trauma surgeon who was the lead author of a 2018 study on weapons used in \u00e2\u0080\u009cactive shooter\u00e2\u0080\u009d incidents, told The Associated Press. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe big difference \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and this is not such a big surprise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is if you give them a semiautomatic, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to shoot twice the number of people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge in New York on Friday temporarily blocked a Trump administration rule that would deny permanent residency to certain aspiring immigrants deemed likely to require government assistance in the future. The rule, which was finalized in August, vastly expanded who could be considered a possible \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublic charge\u00e2\u0080\u009d from someone who would be primarily dependent on the government to someone who might at some point need government help such as food stamps or housing vouchers. The Department of Homeland Security rule, pushed by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading aide on immigration, Stephen Miller, was due to go into effect on Oct. 15. It will now be on hold while legal challenges against it proceed. Judge George Daniels of the Southern District of New York, issued a nationwide block of the rule, writing that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and would suffer \u00e2\u0080\u009cirreparable harm\u00e2\u0080\u009d if the rule were to go into effect. He wrote the government had failed to demonstrate why the current approach was inadequate. The rule, if it is ultimately allowed to go into effect, could be the most drastic of the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies targeting the legal immigration system, experts have said. \u00c2\u00a0The government has argued the rule is necessary to better ensure that immigrants will be self-sufficient. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe public charge standard was never intended to exclude working class immigrants from developing countries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Charles Wheeler, an attorney with the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, which is a plaintiff in the case. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis ruling confirms that the American dream remains open to them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, Daniel Trotta and Kristina Cooke.

      "author": "Ryan J. Reilly",
      "content": " All 12 jurors deliberating the case against racist former New Jersey police chief Frank Nucera agree that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a liar: They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already convicted him of lying to the FBI. The former Bordentown Township police chief concedes he went on racist rants about nonwhite citizens that his underlings recorded. Two of his own officers testified under oath in federal court that Nucera slammed a Black teenager\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head into a metal doorjamb, and Nucera didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the stand in his own defense. But a jury was unable to reach a verdict on two other charges \u00e2\u0080\u0095 hate crime assault and deprivation of civil rights under color of law \u00e2\u0080\u0095 that were directly related to the head slam his officers say he committed. U.S. District Court Judge Robert Kugler of Camden declared a mistrial on those two counts on Friday.\u00c2\u00a0U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito\u00c2\u00a0announced\u00c2\u00a0after the mistrial that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d retry Nucera on the outstanding counts. The jury began deliberations last Wednesday, and had held discussions for over 40 hours.\u00c2\u00a0The Philadelphia Inquirer\u00c2\u00a0reported\u00c2\u00a0that a white juror \u00e2\u0080\u009cstood in the jury box with his hands crossed when the panel solemnly filed into the courtroom\u00e2\u0080\u009d to deliver the verdict on the lying charge this week. The case against Nucera illustrated the challenges in holding officers accountable. Nearly two decades ago, according to The Trentonian, former Bordentown Township police officer Evan Jones says he was pushed out of the force after he filed an excessive force complaint about Nucera with the Burlington County Prosecutor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office.\u00c2\u00a0Current Bordentown Township Police Chief Brian Pesce testified that he had \u00e2\u0080\u009clost all trust and confidence\u00e2\u0080\u009d that complaints about Nucera would be handled appropriately, and told the FBI that a former Burlington County Prosecutor told him to \u00e2\u0080\u009clet sleeping dogs lie\u00e2\u0080\u009d when he learned Nucera was under FBI investigation. Judge Kugler, according to the Inquirer, gave federal prosecutors until Nov. 13 to decide whether they would go to trial once again on the remaining counts. Nucera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney said they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll assess their options on the lying to the FBI conviction, and that Nucera \u00e2\u0080\u009calways... regretted\u00e2\u0080\u009d making those \u00e2\u0080\u009cugly and embarrassing\u00e2\u0080\u009d comments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s held his head high throughout this process,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rocco Cipparone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handled it with grace and dignity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This has been updated with Carpenito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement that prosecutors will retry Nucera.",

      "author": "Daniel Marans",
      "content": " The case for some progressive primary challenges is obvious. Those are the races where an incumbent Democrat in a safe seat has racked up a conservative voting record out of step with their constituents, used their seat for self-enrichment, or otherwise lost touch with their district. The theory behind challenging Rep. Peter DeFazio, 72, who has, since 1987, represented a seat in rural Oregon that now leans just barely Democratic, is more complex. DeFazio, who now serves as chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and longtime supporter of, among other progressive touchstones, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedicare for All,\u00e2\u0080\u009d single-payer health care. But Doyle Canning, a 39-year-old community organizer and attorney who has announced a primary challenge against DeFazio, insists that the veteran congressman is past his expiration date. Canning, who hails from the liberal college town of Eugene, has some standard policy differences with DeFazio. Unlike the incumbent congressman in Oregon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 4th Congressional District, she supports House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 legislation banning military-style \u00e2\u0080\u009cassault\u00e2\u0080\u009d rifles. She is also refusing to accept contributions from corporate political action committees, something DeFazio receives in abundance. Her hardest-hitting critique, however, is that as a committee chair, DeFazio has been milquetoast in his dealings with, and oversight of, the Trump administration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis race is about the future \u00e2\u0080\u0095 of our district, of the country and of the Democratic Party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Canning told HuffPost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we need leadership that is willing to take a stand against the corruption of the Trump administration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d DeFazio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Transportation Committee is charged with oversight of federal government buildings, including the building that houses the Trump International Hotel in Washington; airplane manufacturers and the Federal Aviation Administration; and the conduct of the Secretary of Transportation. At one point or another in the past year, DeFazio has faced accusations of falling short in each of those three areas. DeFazio provided a lengthy statement defending his committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oversight; HuffPost also spoke to committee staff about their work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am running aggressive investigations to get answers about any number of Trump administration actions that fall within my Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jurisdiction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Following a second major Boeing plane crash in March, which killed over 150 people, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded three of the manufacturer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commercial airliners. The tragic crash prompted major questions about why the FAA, under Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supervision, had failed to prevent the crashes. At the time, DeFazio suggested he would stop at nothing to obtain relevant communications about the scandal from both Boeing and the FAA. By early May, it emerged that Boeing knew about the absence of a warning light in one of the deadly planes, but delayed informing authorities, because it considered the light an optional feature available to customers paying a higher premium. But later that month, at a hearing on the crashes with Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acting head of the FAA, DeFazio admitted that he still didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the documents and did nothing to indicate he plans to use his subpoena power to get them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping that they will provide the documents we have requested voluntarily and in the not-too-distant future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. In a May essay, Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, which monitors executive branch corruption, accused DeFazio of taking a softer line than Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who chairs the subcommittee on aviation and space. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have had no serious inquiry into the collapse of government oversight of planes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hauser told HuffPost. Boeing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO Dennis Muilenburg is due to testify before DeFazio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s committee on Oct. 30 \u00e2\u0080\u0095 more than seven months after the plane crash that prompted the FAA to ground planes. Matt Stoller, author of the forthcoming book\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cGoliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d characterized DeFazio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chairmanship unfavorably when compared to, among other colleagues, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chairmanship of the House Judiciary Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antitrust panel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCicilline is doing a great job investigating big tech. DeFazio needs to show that same urgency in investigating Boeing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stoller, a former congressional aide, who now serves as a fellow at the antitrust-focused Open Markets Institute. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing the party of the people means carrying on the legacy of [former California Rep.] Henry Waxman and [former Arkansas Rep.] Wright Patman, people who knew how to uncover the secrets powerful people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the public to know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Members of DeFazio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s committee staff told HuffPost that they are now sifting through hundreds of thousands of documents that they have obtained since May from both Boeing and the FAA. To call Muilenburg, the Boeing CEO, before the committee prior to obtaining those documents would waste the opportunity to grill him in a more informed way, they argued. They also said that forcing disclosure of documents through subpoenas could have delayed the process further by tying the committee up in court with legal challenges. Hauser did not buy those arguments. He maintains that there is no way to know whether documents shared voluntarily are as definitive as those that Boeing and the FAA would reveal if they had no choice. And he noted that the committee could have called Muilenburg in early on, when the political urgency was greatest, then recalled him a second time once the committee had assembled more documents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoeing is definitely happy with Chairman DeFazio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oversight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hauser said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe question is whether Chairman DeFazio is happy about that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In his statement to HuffPost, DeFazio said that he was prioritizing substance over style. He noted that the has already held three hearings on the crashes, which have featured current and former Boeing employees, FAA officials and whistleblowers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy record on safety and oversight is vast and determination dogged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, citing his work on the ValuJet crash in the 1990s. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnyone who knows my record knows that I fight for real results, not empty rhetoric.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then there is the matter of DeFazio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relative inactivity in response to Secretary Chao\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shady conduct. Chao is both the daughter of James Chao, a major Chinese shipping magnate, and the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Politico reported in May that Chao has made a series of appearances indirectly promoting the company her father founded while serving as head of a federal agency overseeing the declining U.S. shipping industry in direct competition with companies like her family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Another Politico report just last week found that 25% of Chao\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meetings with local officials were with people from Kentucky, the state her husband represents in the Senate. The House Oversight and Reform Committee, which has broad supervision of the executive branch, has initiated an investigation into Chao\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct related to her family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company, sending a letter to Chao in mid-September demanding documents related to her communication with the company. But DeFazio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transportation committee, which has a narrower focus on Chao and her agency, has yet to pursue comparable action. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee staff members who spoke to HuffPost said that given the committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resources it is letting the Oversight Committee take the lead on investigating Chao\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ethical queries, though it is acting in a supporting capacity. DeFazio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s committee is also in touch with the Department of Transportation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inspector general to decide its next steps. Hauser, of the Revolving Door Project, considers it \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeckless\u00e2\u0080\u009d that DeFazio has not called on Chao to testify before the committee either about Boeing, her own conduct or any other matter. (Committee staff said they would not hesitate to call Chao before the committee if they considered it necessary.) Critics of DeFazio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tenure felt as though they had come across the secret to his motives in a Washington Post article at the end of August, which addressed a supposed lack of progress in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigations into the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Trump built the hotel in the Old Post Office Building, which he is leasing from the federal government. That means that DeFazio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s panel has oversight over Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparent use of the hotel as a vehicle for self-enrichment over the course of his presidency. In the Post story, Rep. Dina Titus (D-Nev.), chair of the subcommittee overseeing the hotel, suggested that DeFazio was treading carefully in his investigations into the hotel in the hopes of negotiating infrastructure legislation with Trump. Titus subsequently took back the remarks, claiming the article \u00e2\u0080\u009cmischaracterizes\u00e2\u0080\u009d the progress that DeFazio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s committee has made. Shortly after the Post story came out, Titus joined a press release with DeFazio \u00e2\u0080\u009ccorrecting the record\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. The heart of the investigation, which began after Trump was elected in November 2016, entails requiring the General Services Administration, the agency that manages federal government buildings, to conduct an audit of the hotel. In his statement to HuffPost, DeFazio said that the GSA has handed over thousands of documents, but is still withholding many. He has given the administration a deadline to hand over the remainder and he will \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot hesitate\u00e2\u0080\u009d to use his subpoena power to compel their release. The challenge for Canning is making the charges against DeFazio stick in a largely rural district that Democrats are hanging on to by a thread. Oregon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 4th covers a large tract of land in the southwestern corner of the state, which was once home to a thriving timber industry. Eugene, which is home to the University of Oregon, and Corvallis, which is home to Oregon State, are blue dots in a sea of rural red terrain. As rural Oregon, like rural America, has trended away from Democrats, DeFazio has defied the fate of national Democrats. In 2016, DeFazio was re-elected by 16 percentage points, but Hillary Clinton edged out Trump in the same district by a mere 0.1 points. Canning, whose husband works at the University of Oregon, in many ways embodies the political leanings of the district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liberal population hubs. She is a co-founder of the Center for Story-Based Strategy, a nonprofit that seeks to advance progressive causes through storytelling, and she has previously worked for an environmental justice organization that fights the racially disparate impacts of ecological depradation. Like many Democrats furious about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corruption and racism, Canning is calling for a sense of urgency to match the moment, including ruling out any significant cooperation with the administration until Trump is impeached. She took DeFazio to task on Twitter for suggesting that work on a federal highway bill, which would necessarily be bipartisan in order to pass, would proceed apace. DeFazio campaign manager Carly Gabrielson dismissed the criticism as contrary to Canning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals of taking action against climate change. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder the Chairman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is moving legislation to implement the goals of the Green New Deal\u00e2\u0080\u0094 goals that Doyle Canning claims to share, yet at the same time she believes that business should stop while Congress investigates Trump?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gabrielson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have it both ways, and frankly it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an absurd position.\u00e2\u0080\u009d HuffPost pressed Canning on the difficulty of prevailing against DeFazio in a rural swing seat. Canning responded that, like many progressive challengers before her, she is betting that a principled fighter is capable of expanding the electorate by turning out nonvoters. Among other groups, she wants to appeal to the growing number of eligible Latinx voters who moved to the district for work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building a coalition of the new face of the Democratic Party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s younger, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more diverse, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more feminist, and it looks different than it did in \u00e2\u0080\u009986.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Rebecca Klein",
      "content": " WeWork informed parents on Friday that it would no longer operate its private school in Manhattan after the 2019-20 school year, HuffPost has learned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWeWork will continue to operate WeGrow through the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year, providing a quality education and classroom experience for all students,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a WeWork spokesperson said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs part of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to focus on its core business, WeWork has informed the families of WeGrow students that we will not operate WeGrow after this school year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWeWork and the families of WeGrow students are engaging in discussions with interested parties regarding plans for WeGrow for the following school year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the spokesperson added. The small New York City private school has been open since 2018 and costs between $22,000 and $42,000 a year in tuition, depending on the age of the student. Its website calls it a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconscious entrepreneurial school,\u00e2\u0080\u009d offering students mentorship from WeWork employees, weekly trips to a farm, daily meditation and yoga, while preaching lofty goals about nurturing students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 souls. HuffPost spoke with several people close to the school in the past few weeks to get a better sense of the institution. They described a school that is run like the company of WeWork, subject to constant changes or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisruption,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sometimes without full consideration for the children these changes impact. However, they also described an idealistic learning space, where children for the most part seem to be happy and thriving. According to one former employee, the company recently redesigned part of the school, which they speculated cost up to several million dollars (a spokesperson for WeWork did not respond to questions about this). The school is a casualty of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new efforts to downsize after the implosion of its planned public offering and a staggering reduction in its valuation. The past few weeks have been chaotic for the company, which rents out shared workspaces to businesses and entrepreneurs. Its CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann stepped down and there are rumors of mass layoffs that could impact thousands of employees. Amid the chaos, WeGrow parents wondered whether the school would even make it through the year, lining up backup options in case of an abrupt shuttering. \u00e2\u0080\u009cParents and administrators are exploring all options to keep WeGrow open,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said parent Jessica Ducroux on Friday morning. The school was the brainchild of WeWork co-founder and chief brand and impact officer Rebekah Neumann, who served as the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO before stepping down from her roles at the company with her husband, Adam. Indeed, WeGrow mimicked WeWork, as the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day to day was sometimes rejiggered on short notice, which could be incompatible with the needs of children, sources said. The WeWork spokesperson did not comment on this characterization of school life at WeGrow. A representative for the Neumanns did not immediately have comment. But by its second year, the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enrollment had grown to about 100 students, including a number of children whose parents worked for the company. In 2018, Rebekah Neumann called the school \u00e2\u0080\u0095 and the ability to bring company employees closer to their children \u00e2\u0080\u0095 part of WeWork\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core goals, according to CNN. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to make a world where people can work to make a life and not just a living, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of a larger, more holistic mission to elevate the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consciousness, to create a world where people are happy and fulfilled and living in a sharing state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Indeed, the school employs staffers with titles like \u00e2\u0080\u009ccreative expressions manager\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmanager of wisdom cultures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In recent weeks, teachers have worked to shield kids from the disarray enveloping the larger company, according to a WeGrow parent. This parent praised the school for nurturing children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social-emotional development, as opposed to perpetuating a rat race focused on test scores and achievement, and worries that the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true successes \u00e2\u0080\u0095 its focus on mindfulness and community building \u00e2\u0080\u0095 will be overshadowed by schadenfreude over WeWork\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shortcomings. The school \u00e2\u0080\u0095 like WeWork spaces \u00e2\u0080\u0095 emphasizes design, and is complete with \u00e2\u0080\u009cmodular classrooms, tree houses and a vertical farm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d per the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website. WeGrow is one of WeWork\u00e2\u0080\u0099s auxiliary offerings. The company also rents out furnished apartments and has a gym. Rebekah Neumann appears to have had high ambitions for the institution, previously telling CNN that she hoped a WeGrow would operate in every city where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a WeWork office. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will eventually be able to sustain independently for sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said at the time.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "FORT COLLINS, Colo. \u00e2\u0080\u0095 William Perry Pendley, the controversial acting director of the Bureau of Land Management, told a room full of journalists on Friday that his opinions on climate change and immigrants are \u00e2\u0080\u009cirrelevant\u00e2\u0080\u009d to his job overseeing 245 million acres of public land. Speaking on a panel at the Society of Environmental Journalists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 annual conference, Pendley, a conservative lawyer who has spent his career fighting federal land protections and environmental regulation, sparred repeatedly with reporters. He refused to comment about his past statements that cast doubt on basic climate science and compared immigrants to a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccancer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also repeatedly responded to questions by saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI disagree with your premise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As recently as February, Pendley compared the climate crisis to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cunicorn\u00e2\u0080\u009d because \u00e2\u0080\u009cneither exists.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked to clarify his position on Friday, he deferred to his boss, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who has said he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lost sleep over soaring atmospheric carbon dioxide and blamed Congress for his own inaction on the climate.\u00c2\u00a0Bernhardt had been scheduled to appear at the conference but canceled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a scientist, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a lawyer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pendley said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI defer to the secretary. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been very clear on this subject. He believes that climate change is real, that mankind has an impact, that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re unable to project future climate conditions, but that we need to understand the consequences.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked again about his own views, Pendley balked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNope, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to clarify. Those are my personal opinions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a Marine. I follow orders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pendley added that he has not been briefed on climate impacts to America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public lands in the three months he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been acting head of the\u00c2\u00a0 BLM. In 2007, Pendley referred to undocumented immigrants as \u00e2\u0080\u009cspreading like a cancer\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a fundraising mailer for his legal fund\u00c2\u00a0resurfaced by CNN this week. When pressed on Friday about the statement, Pendley brushed off the question entirely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy personal opinions are irrelevant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a new job now. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a zealous advocate for my client. My client is the American people and my bosses are the president of the United States and Secretary Bernhardt. What I thought, what I wrote, what I did in the past is irrelevant. I have orders, I have laws to obey, and I intend to do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pendley didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hesitate, though, to slam\u00c2\u00a0Democratic presidential candidates who have pledged to stop new fossil fuel leasing on public lands for fossil fuel development if elected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuch a policy would be absolutely devastating; it would be absolutely devastating not just to the American West, but to the entire country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Leaving fossil fuels in the ground, he added, would be \u00e2\u0080\u009cabsolutely insane\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ca terrible blow to the American people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The room, as moderators requested, refrained from clapping or booing throughout the panel, which included a gas company executive, the Fort Collins mayor, an American Indian studies academic, an environmentalist and a representative of the outdoor recreation industry. But at one point, the audience in the packed auditorium at Colorado State University gasped as Pendley abruptly interrupted a Denver Post reporter as she asked a follow-up question, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want to ask a question and get an answer or do you want to keep talking?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pendley was asked about the BLM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision in May to scrub language about land stewardship from its news releases, which now exclusively highlights the economic value of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public lands. He initially shrugged and whispered inaudibly to Shea Loper, the U.S. government relations chief for the Canadian gas giant Encana Corp. He said he was unable to speak to the decision because it occurred before he arrived at the agency. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t respond to your question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the end of the discussion, panelists were asked what they view as the biggest threat facing public lands today. Pendley responded,\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get really in the weeds. I think the biggest issue I see is the wild horse and burro issue. We have 88,000 wild horses and burros on our Western federal lands. They are causing havoc on the lands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Paul Blumenthal",
      "content": " The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday upheld a subpoena that House Democrats sent to President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accounting firm for his financial records and tax returns. The court issued a 2-1 ruling\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf\u00c2\u00a0that the House Oversight & Reform Committee has the constitutional authority to investigate wrongdoing by the president of the United States and can therefore subpoena his financial records in pursuit of that investigation. The subpoena was initially filed by the committee to Mazars LLP, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accounting firm, as part of its pursuit to evaluate and update existing ethics legislation. It came after former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen told the committee that the president routinely manipulated his finances to obtain loans and evade taxes. Lawyers for the committee argued that the pursuit of these documents was part of its legislative function as it evaluated new executive branch financial disclosure and conflict of interest laws. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyers intervened to argue that the House did not have a legitimate legislative purpose in pursuing the documents from the accounting firm and that the only valid way to subpoena any document connected to the president was through an impeachment. The two judges who voted to uphold the subpoena \u00e2\u0080\u0095 David Tatel, appointed by President Bill Clinton, and Patricia Millett, appointed by President Barack Obama \u00e2\u0080\u0095 ruled that the committee was acting under its legislative function in pursuit of potential legislation. They also ruled that the committee issued its subpoena under valid authority granted by House Rules and the Constitution. In doing so, Tatel and Millett upheld multiple precedents enabling congressional investigations into the executive branch that could uncover law-breaking and other wrongdoing. The judges knocked down arguments made by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers that the public statements of committee members showed the committee was not pursuing a legitimate legislative purpose, but rather an unconstitutional law-enforcement action targeting the president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFollowing that course, we conclude that the public record reveals legitimate legislative pursuits, not an impermissible law-enforcement purpose, behind the Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subpoena,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tatel and Millett wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a result, we need not decide precisely what deference we owe Congress, as we would reach the same conclusion absent any deference at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They also found that the committee was pursuing legislation that could be enacted. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers tried to argue that the legislation would be found unconstitutional and therefore was not legitimate. \u00e2\u0080\u009c[W]e detect no inherent constitutional flaw in laws requiring Presidents to publicly disclose certain financial information. And that is enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the majority opinion reads. Their ultimate conclusion: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt bottom, this subpoena is a valid exercise of the legislative oversight authority because it seeks information important to determining the fitness of legislation to address potential problems within the Executive Branch and the electoral system; it does not seek to determine the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fitness for office.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, issued a dissent that broke with long-standing Supreme Court precedent by arguing that Congress has no right to investigate the president except under its impeachment authority. \u00e2\u0080\u009c[A]llegations of illegal conduct against the President cannot be investigated by Congress except through impeachment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rao wrote in her dissent. Such a determination would overturn a 1962 Supreme Court precedent that \u00e2\u0080\u009ca congressional committee which is engaged in a legitimate legislative investigation need not grind to a halt whenever...crime or wrongdoing is disclosed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe dissent would reorder the very structure of the Constitution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tatel and Millett argue in their majority opinion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThroughout history, the Constitution has left to Congress the judgment whether to commence the impeachment process. But the dissent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach would not even allow Congress to make the quintessentially legislative judgment that some concerns about potential misconduct or illegality are better addressed through oversight and legislation than impeachment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If Rao\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion overturned past precedent, Congress would be left with no recourse to investigate impeachable executive branch officials for wrongdoing unless it immediately opens an impeachment inquiry. This would gut congressional investigatory powers and tilt the balance of power between the branches of government even further to the benefit of the executive branch. House Democrats previously leaned on this case as an argument against pursuing impeachment earlier in 2019. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) argued that Democrats needed to pursue the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s documents through the courts as part of the ordinary course of business. A whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disclosure that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election, however, changed that equation. The House is now engaged in an impeachment inquiry. This decision is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court, to which Trump has appointed two justices: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an ally of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, was asked in 2018 whether the courts would allow House Democrats to obtain the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax returns. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be trapped into appealing to the Supreme Court, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see whether or not the Kavanaugh fight was worth it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Gingrich replied.",

      "content": "LAKE CHARLES, La. (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Donald Trump on Friday pressed his argument that the House impeachment inquiry is nothing more than a new attempt to overturn his election based on \u00e2\u0080\u009ca lot of crap.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump found a sympathetic audience in Louisiana, where an arena packed with his supporters roared at his profane denunciations of the proceedings hundreds of miles away in the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been trying to stop us for more than three years with a lot of crap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, referring to the investigation into Russian election interference that concluded earlier this year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey know they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win on Election Day so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pursuing an illegal, invalid and unconstitutional, bulls\u00e2\u0080\u0095- impeachment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the president thundered at his second political rally in as many days. Trump also pressed his unproven claims against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president. Trump complained about a double standard in news media coverage. He said if any of his children were similarly accused, the media wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call the allegations unsubstantiated \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey would be saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the nearest cell?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or Hunter Biden. House Democrats have opened an impeachment inquiry over Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Ukraine, in which he asked that country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president during a telephone call in July to investigate Biden. An intelligence community whistleblower complained that Trump was abusing his office for personal political gain. Trump insists he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything wrong and has called the conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zelenskiy has said he was not pressured by Trump. Trump claimed Democrats are \u00e2\u0080\u009crage filled\u00e2\u0080\u009d and have opened the impeachment inquiry because they \u00e2\u0080\u009chave gone completely insane\u00e2\u0080\u009d in their \u00e2\u0080\u009cnonstop battle\u00e2\u0080\u009d to overturn the 2016 presidential election result. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNancy Pelosi hates the United States of America, or she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be doing this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said of the Democratic speaker of the House, who had long resisted calls to initiate impeachment proceedings. Pelosi has said \u00e2\u0080\u009cno one is above the law\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Trump must be held accountable for actions that she says jeopardize U.S. national security, the integrity of American elections and the Constitution. Trump came to Louisiana to unite a squabbling Republican Party against the Deep South\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only Democratic governor, hoping to keep John Bel Edwards from notching a primary win in Saturday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election. Republican loyalties are split between two major candidates: Ralph Abraham, a third-term congressman and physician from rural northeast Louisiana, and Eddie Rispone, a businessman and longtime political donor from Baton Rouge who is making his first bid for office. Both Republican candidates claim long-term support from Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTomorrow, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to vote John Bel Edwards out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, criticizing the Democrat as bad for the state. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get 50%, then one of our two great candidates will win that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president is not endorsing either GOP candidate to maximize chances that Edwards will fall below the 50% vote threshold needed to avoid a runoff, according to a White House aide and a campaign aide, both of whom asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss strategy. Trump plans to endorse whichever GOP candidate makes it to a runoff against Edwards, the aides said. In Louisiana, all candidates run against each other, regardless of party, on the same primary ballot. With polls showing Edwards well in the lead, national Republicans have bombarded the state with millions in advertising and visits from Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr. to urge anti-Edwards votes and force a Nov. 16 runoff. Trump acknowledged the reality of college football season in the South and urged everyone to vote before they head to Saturday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big matchup between Louisiana State University and Florida State. He said people should vote before they go to the game, otherwise they will feel guilty and \u00e2\u0080\u009cit will ruin your entire afternoon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump called Edwards \u00e2\u0080\u009ca liberal Democrat who has sold you out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d even though Edwards isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the type of liberal with whom the president usually clashes. He described Abraham and Rispone, the two Republican candidates, as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-life, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pro-Louisiana energy if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OK.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump also kept up a sports theme by inviting the winners of the 2019 Little League World Series to the stage. Trump met in the Oval Office earlier Friday with members of the Eastbank All-Stars and invited them to fly home aboard Air Force One. The team is based in suburban New Orleans. Trump said he had become accustomed to watching Japan win the event. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut this year you have the world champions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told the rally crowd before introducing the players one by one. ___ Associated Press writer Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report. __ Follow Darlene Superville and Melinda Deslatte on Twitter at:\u00c2\u00a0http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap and http://twitter.com/melindadeslatte",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Many of the allegations and fuzzy \u00e2\u0080\u009cfacts\u00e2\u0080\u009d that President Donald Trump and his allies have cited to defend pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden gained traction in the press thanks to one journalist: John Solomon, whose stories and columns in The Hill have made him a Fox News regular (and now a contributor). Solomon, who announced plans to leave The Hill last month, is now under fire \u00e2\u0080\u0095 as he has been in the past \u00e2\u0080\u0095 for deviations from normal journalistic practice. In search of a convenient narrative, Solomon has embraced questionable sources and even shared a pre-publication copy of one story with a Ukrainian American businessman who federal authorities now say was illegally trying to influence American politics. Solomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s articles are emblematic of the way the right-wing news pipeline to Trump functions: Shaky allegations get picked up by eager partisan journalists, who are then featured on Fox News where they grab the attention of the president. Last week, Solomon defended his decision to send a draft of a March 26 story on a Ukrainian anti-corruption organization to three Trump-associated operatives hours before its publication. The draft of his story \u00e2\u0080\u0095 titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cUS Embassy pressed Ukraine to drop probe of George Soros group during 2016 election\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0095 was shown to Lev Parnas, an Ukrainian American associate of Rudy Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who was arrested\u00c2\u00a0Thursday on charges of campaign finance violation, as well as frequent Fox News guests\u00c2\u00a0Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing. Solomon suggested this was part of his fact-checking process even though the story did not appear to concern those three beyond their interest in potentially damaging information about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opponents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI typically spend a long period of time before any column or news story fact-checking information with numerous people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Solomon tweeted. But Solomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dedication to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfact-checking information with numerous people\u00e2\u0080\u009d didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to extend to a main subject of his story, the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, which he suggested was \u00e2\u0080\u009ccollaborating with FBI agents\u00e2\u0080\u009d who were investigating Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s then-campaign chair Paul Manafort. Solomon also suggested that AntAC, a Ukrainian organization, avoided an investigation because of the support of the Obama administration and billionaire George Soros, a common bogeyman for conservatives and target for conspiracy theorists. (AntAC receives funding from Soros\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Open Society Foundations, as well as from the U.S. government and a range of other donors.) Solomon never reached out to AntAC for comment about allegations made to him by former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko, according to AntAC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive director, Daria Kaleniuk. (Solomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story states that he repeatedly reached out to AntAC and Open Society Foundations, although he does not specify when.)\u00c2\u00a0And unlike the Republican operatives, Kaleniuk said AntAC received no draft of the article before The Hill published it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder why the same approach was not given to me, as he was naming my organization and he was actually sliming it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kaleniuk told HuffPost. Solomon did initially contact Kaleniuk in October 2018, many months before publishing his column in The Hill, saying he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cworking on a story for publication Monday about the DOJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kleptocracy Project and its success in Ukraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked for comment on a number of questions, including about connections between AntAC, Soros\u00e2\u0080\u0099 foundation and the FBI. Kaleniuk said she found the questions biased and conspiratorial and did not respond. Solomon did not publish anything to do with the Kleptocracy Project or Ukraine in the weeks after his email, according to The Hill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s archives. After Solomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story ran in March, Kaleniuk contacted The Hill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s editors requesting an opportunity to comment on the allegations against her organization. But her rebuttal clearly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get as much traction: The Hill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website says that Solomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original piece had over 36,000 shares, while Kaleniuk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s piece had just 118. A Twitter search of accounts run by The Hill or The Hill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion section didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t turn up any links to Kaleniuk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s piece, though the accounts did promote Solomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. Solomon did not respond to a voicemail message and multiple emails from HuffPost. Editors at The Hill did not respond to requests for comment. Solomon has defended his journalistic practices on Twitter. In a series of tweets\u00c2\u00a0this month, he said he would sometimes send people a \u00e2\u0080\u009csummary of my reporting\u00e2\u0080\u009d before publication. But according to the Daily Beast, what Solomon sent to Republican operatives hours before his Ukraine story was posted online was no \u00e2\u0080\u009csummary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was a copy of his story\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0095 headline, lede, and paragraph after paragraph. Solomon also tweeted that this was part of a fact-checking process that he had followed at every job he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d held, \u00e2\u0080\u009cstarting when I was a young reporter at AP and continuing today at The Hill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is common for journalists to send a list of fact-checking questions to a subject of an article. But sharing full, unpublished drafts \u00e2\u0080\u0095 especially with partisan political operatives who are not directly involved in the story \u00e2\u0080\u0095 is a violation of journalistic standards that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fly at his previous publications. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAP standards prohibit any behavior or activity that creates a conflict of interest, including sharing unpublished drafts of stories with sources,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a spokesperson for the Associated Press told HuffPost. Solomon said that he had over \u00e2\u0080\u009cthree dozen communications over three days involved in the fact checking process for that particular story.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said his fact-checking process could catch mistakes and lead to better context and comments. Solomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reporting has been a cause of concern for newsroom staff at The Hill, who have criticized his work for bias and shared their unease at his close ties to Trump associates. Over a dozen staff members sent a memo to The Hill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s management complaining about Solomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stories and accusing him of leaving out important context that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit his theories, The Washington Post reported last year. HuffPost last year debunked a misleading piece by Solomon that suggested FBI agents who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d exchanged anti-Trump text messages had leaked anti-Trump material to the media. They had not. Solomon was shifted to the role of \u00e2\u0080\u009copinion contributor\u00e2\u0080\u009d following the staffers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 memo, according to The Daily Beast, while Solomon claimed he had requested the change. Questions have also been raised about the sources Solomon has used for his columns. His March series of stories on Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u0095 a country with complex politics he had little prior history of covering \u00e2\u0080\u0095 carried a wide range of claims against U.S. Democratic officials and Obama-era appointees. He suggested that Ukrainian officials, urged along by then-U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, conspired with Democrats to influence the 2016 presidential election and release damaging information against Trump. He also contended that then-Vice President Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire prosecutor general Viktor Shokin in order to quash an investigation into his son Hunter Biden, who had business ties in Ukraine. (Shokin was, in fact, widely criticized for not pushing corruption cases hard enough.) One of the main sources named in Solomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s series on Ukraine was Yuri Lutsenko, who served as prosecutor general after Shokin.\u00c2\u00a0Many journalists, foreign policy experts and activists who focus on Ukraine have criticized the idea of treating Lutsenko as a reliable source, saying that he, too, is a discredited figure who has been an impediment to anti-corruption efforts. After the Trump administration recalled Ambassador Yovanovitch, Lutsenko texted AntAC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kaleniuk to brag about how he had gotten rid of the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ally. Lutsenko\u00c2\u00a0has also repeatedly backtracked on his various claims, including telling the Los Angeles Times in late September that he never found any evidence of wrongdoing by the Biden family. Ukrainian authorities announced on Tuesday that they have launched a criminal investigation into Lutsenko over his alleged links to illegal gambling. Lutsenko, who traveled to the United Kingdom days before the announcement, has denied any wrongdoing. Nonetheless, Solomon boosted Lutsenko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conspiracy claims against the Bidens, Yovanovitch and Clinton not only in his columns for The Hill but also on Sean Hannity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fox News show, which often serves as a direct pipeline to Trump. The president has tweeted about Solomon at least four times this year, usually in connection with the columnist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fox News appearances. After Solomon was on Hannity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s program in March, Trump tweeted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJohn Solomon: As Russia Collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was quoting the headline of Solomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s March 20 column, which was based on an interview with Lutsenko. Appearing alongside Solomon on Fox News that evening were diGenova and Toensing, two of the political operatives to whom he emailed his draft of a later March column. Solomon was back on Fox News nine days later, suggesting to host Laura Ingraham that Democrats were attempting to hide a conspiracy between Clinton and Ukrainian officials to target Trump during the 2016 campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want people to start digging into,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Solomon said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re digging in it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been reading your reporting on that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ingraham responded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe look forward to the next report.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

Trump had pressed for her ouster for months as Yovanovitch was accused of disloyalty, which was categorically untrue, according to her prepared statement obtained by The Washington Post. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs best as I can tell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cunfounded and false claims\u00e2\u0080\u009d were pressed by \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople with clearly questionable motives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yovanovitch said in her statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motives for attacking me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told lawmakers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump referred to Yovanovitch in his controversial phone call in July with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, which has revealed in a whistleblower complaint and has become the focus of an impeachment inquiry. He called her \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad news\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said that Yovanovitch\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cis going to go through some things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump pressed Zelensky in the July 25 call to launch an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden and Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while the White House was withholding military aid to Ukraine. Giuliani has admitted that he, Fruman and Parnas were out to gather damaging information about Yovanovitch and other Trump targets. Federal law requires U.S. citizens to disclose to the Justice Department contacts with the American government or media at the direction of foreign government officials or politicians. Giuliani has insisted the law does not apply to his activities because he was working on behalf of Trump, not for foreign officials.",

      "content": " A man who claimed earlier this week that he had been paid for sex by presidential candidate Kamala Harris now says he was hired for an acting role. Oh, and he claims now that he thought Harris was a fictional person, according to an exclusive interview with the Daily Beast. On Wednesday, 26-year-old personal trainer Sean Newaldass participated in a news conference organized by Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, two far-right conspiracy theorists who are already known for pushing\u00c2\u00a0fraudulent claims. Newaldass read from a fact sheet about his alleged relationship with the California senator, which can be seen here,\u00c2\u00a0and claimed he and Harris\u00c2\u00a0had a total of 11 \u00e2\u0080\u009csexual encounters\u00e2\u0080\u009d in hotels in Iowa; Washington, D.C.; and New York City, according to the Daily Dot. Check out this video of the news conference \u00e2\u0080\u0095 which is hilarious in its ineptness. On Friday, Newaldass told a much different story than the one he told on Wednesday. He said Wohl and Burkman hired him after he answered a CraigsList ad\u00c2\u00a0seeking a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmale actor\u00e2\u0080\u009d for \u00e2\u0080\u009cperformance art in DC.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Newaldass said he believed the news conference was actually an audition for a Spike TV show that no longer exists. In fact, he had no clue Harris was a politician, much less a potential presidential candidate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought I was acting for a role in a movie, like a role in a TV series,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Newaldass told the Daily Beast. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought everything was staged, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking everyone is an actor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even more important:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m completely oblivious to who [Harris] is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Newaldass told the Daily Beast. Later in the interview, Newaldass admitted he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s researched Harris since the news conference and now says he plans to vote for her. However, Newaldass said he regrets his part in the attempted smear because, like Harris, he is of mixed Indian and Caribbean ancestry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hurtful, because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hurting my own ethnicity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Newaldass said. Newaldass said he was supposed to receive $500 for his services but hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet. When the Daily Beast reached out to Wohl for his reaction, he responded cryptically with a laughing crying face emoji. HuffPost reached out to Wohl, but he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t immediately respond. The smear against Harris was the latest to backfire for Wohl and Burkman. Earlier this month, the two dirty tricksters attempted to smear Sen.\u00c2\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00c2\u00a0of Massachusetts as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccougar\u00e2\u0080\u009d by holding a news conference with a former Marine in his mid-20s who claimed he had a paid sexual affair with Warren, 70, that included bondage. Warren got the last laugh with a witty response that embraced her \u00e2\u0080\u009ccougar\u00e2\u0080\u009d past, telling the world it made her who she is.",

The Council on American-Islamic Relations\u00c2\u00a0and its Minnesota chapter slammed Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech in Minneapolis in which he singled out the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Somali-born Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar as an \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica-hating socialist\u00e2\u0080\u009d before broadening his attacks to the local Somali refugee population as a whole. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLast night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s racist rant targeting Somali-Americans is just the latest example of Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of white supremacist and anti-immigrant rhetoric to advance his twisted political agenda by dividing our nation along racial, ethnic and religious lines,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nihad Awad, CAIR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national executive director, said in a statement\u00c2\u00a0Friday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is all the more disturbing that the almost all-white audience welcomed this overt racism and that Republican political leaders remain silent or even support such bigotry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During his speech at Minneapolis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Target Center, Trump prompted boos from the audience when he said the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Somali refugees had been welcomed by Washington politicians \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithout considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Continuing, he boasted of his plan to slash refugee resettlement by nearly 85% from 2016 levels, declaring that \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the Trump administration, we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are keeping terrorists, criminals and extremists the hell out of our country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rebuking Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scare tactics, Awad warned of their consequences. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vile views and policies are having a corrosive effect on the ties that bind our nation together, and if left unchecked by those who value American traditions of inclusion and mutual respect, will do untold damage to our democracy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Minnesota branch, also called out the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009chate rhetoric,\u00e2\u0080\u009d raising concerns that it \u00e2\u0080\u009cplaces the entire Somali community in Minnesota and nationwide in danger from the growing white supremacist movement that looks to him for validation and encouragement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Awad and Hussein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks added to criticism from Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

      "author": "Mary Papenfuss",
      "content": " After six months on the job, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan stepped down Friday. President Donald Trump said in a tweet that McAleenan was leaving to \u00e2\u0080\u009cspend more time with his family and go into the private sector.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said McAleenan \u00e2\u0080\u009chas done an outstanding job .... We have worked well together with Border Crossings being way down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongratulations Kevin\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said he would be announcing a new acting secretary next week. McAleenan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fit with the Trump administration was reportedly rocky from the start. He was quoted by The Washington Post in a story early this month that he was struggling to control the department among Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political appointees in senior roles. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McAleenan told the Post. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncomfortable, as the accountable senior figure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Post described him as increasingly isolated and overshadowed by others more \u00e2\u0080\u009ceffusive\u00e2\u0080\u009d in their praise of Trump. He was never formally nominated for the job. McAleenan thanked the president in a tweet Friday for the \u00e2\u0080\u009copportunity to serve alongside the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said with Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have made tremendous progress mitigating the border security and humanitarian crisis we faced this year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a longer attached statement, he cited success in reducing unlawful crossings, partnering with other governments to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccounter\u00e2\u0080\u009d human smugglers and \u00e2\u0080\u009caddress the causes of migration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He vowed to cooperate in a \u00e2\u0080\u009csmooth transition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Monday, McAleenan left the stage at a Georgetown University immigration conference when demonstrators shouted him down, chanting: \u00e2\u0080\u009cImmigrants are under attack\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cChildren are under attack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d McAleenan took over the department after Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was forced out in the spring, reportedly after she refused to reinstate Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy of separating migrant children from their families.",
