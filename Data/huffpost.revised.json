      "title": "Lead Pipes Are Safe From The EPA\u2019s New Drinking Water Rule", 
      "content": " City water systems face stricter standards under a new regulation from the Environmental Protection Agency, but they still won\u2019t have to replace lead pipes. Utilities will have to do a better job of testing for lead in people\u2019s drinking water, according to the updated version of the Lead and Copper Rule \u2015 the same regulation that failed to stop the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, in 2014. Bad water treatment decisions spiked the city\u2019s water with lead that year, resulting in confirmed higher lead levels in Flint children. The government didn\u2019t admit the crisis until late in 2015. The new regulation has found some critics. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s new Lead and Copper Rule is a step backwards and a slap in the face to the children in Flint,\u201d Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said in a statement. Lead is a brain-damaging neurotoxin. It also happens to be a pliable metal that is handy for making pipes. It has been mostly banned from use in plumbing materials, but millions of buildings across the country still get water from old lead service lines that could last for decades more. In recent years, public health experts have learned that even tiny amounts of exposure can be dangerous. Many water regulation experts say the only way to make sure drinking water is safe from lead is to force cities to get rid of their lead pipes altogether. But digging up lead pipes is expensive. Flint has only done so thanks partly to a $100 million infusion from the federal government in the wake of the crisis. In a draft of its proposed regulation, the EPA said that \u201cdue to the financial and practical challenges of wide-spread replacement of lead pipes around the country, it is important to use our nation\u2019s resources wisely, and thus target actions where they are most needed and can provide the most good.\u201d Instead of replacing pipes, both the current and proposed new rule tell cities to add chemicals to their drinking water to make it less corrosive and form a protective coating on the inside of service lines. The new regulation will make more cities conduct corrosion control testing. It would also require cities to take an inventory of their pipes, since many were laid so long ago utilities aren\u2019t even sure where they are. And for the first time the rule will require utilities to check for lead in schools and daycares, which have been exempt even though children\u2019s brains are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults. \u201cToday, the Trump administration is delivering on its commitment to ensure all Americans have access to clean drinking water by proposing the first major overhaul of the Lead and Copper Rule in over two decades,\u201d EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement Thursday. Under the current rule, utilities have to replace 7% of their lead pipes annually if samples taken from people\u2019s taps exceeds a certain threshold. The new rule would require them to replace only 3% of pipes annually if they exceed the threshold \u2015 which isn\u2019t getting stricter. Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech civil engineering professor who worked with Flint residents to blow the whistle on the city\u2019s water lead, said he thought the relaxed standard might actually lead to a better outcome. \u201cDoing 7% out of the blue was just considered so unthinkable that many utilities said they can\u2019t do it, they\u2019d rather cheat and pretend their water\u2019s safe,\u201d Edwards said. (Flint, for instance, avoided taking samples from enough homes that were known to have lead pipes.) Edwards believes it\u2019s unrealistic to expect the kind of public investment it would take to fix the problem nationally. If the Flint water crisis didn\u2019t make it happen, what would? \u201cLead pipes are going to be there for my lifetime and my children\u2019s lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get the water you pay for.\u201d",

      "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0(D-N.Y.) served up a bit of sass in response to a news article that criticized her for spending $300 on a haircut. On Wednesday, the freshman congresswoman was targeted by conservative news outlet\u00a0The Washington Times in an article titled \u201cEXCLUSIVE: Self-declared socialist AOC splurges on high-dollar hairdo.\u201d The piece explained that Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0\u201cspent nearly $300 on her hairdo\u201d at the Last Tangle Salon in Washington, D.C., last month. The article went on to say that she \u201cshelled out $80 for a haircut and $180 for lowlights\u201d and that a\u00a0\u201c20% tip would have added $52 to the bill.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why hair maintenance would be news. The outlet also clearly does not understand how much it costs for a woman to get her hair done in America, as it quoted the president of Americans for Limited Government, Richard Manning, calling Ocasio-Cortez \u201cthe Eva Peron of American politics.\u201d \u201cShe preaches socialism while living the life of the privileged,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with spending money to make yourself look better, especially as a personality who depends upon visual mediums for her power. But it is a bad look to spend hundreds of dollars to get your hair done to make a video decrying income inequality.\u201d Democratic socialist publication Jacobin tweeted about the article, quipping that it\u2019s sad to see democratic socialists like Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u201cdo things like buy winter coats and get haircuts.\u201d On Thursday morning, Ocasio-Cortez responded to Jacobin\u2019s missive about the article with some statistics about poverty in America and how the policies of democratic socialists are not to blame. \u201cOur policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people. They\u2019re just mad we look good doing it,\u201d she wrote, accompanied by a hair toss emoji. Many people on Twitter were incredulous that the cost of the New York congresswoman\u2019s haircut was \u201cnews\u201d: The Washington Times piece also notes that the 29-year-old \u201ccould have saved roughly $100 for the same hairstyle at the government-subsidized Capitol Hill barbershop.\u201d \u201cHer high-dollar hairdo stands in stark contrast to that of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator from Alabama who is a regular customer at Senate Hair Care Services,\u201d reads the piece, which explains that the barbershop serves \u201cmembers of Congress and the public\u201d and charges $20 for a men\u2019s cut. Anyone who has ever been to a hair salon can tell you that a men\u2019s haircut almost always costs less than a woman\u2019s, which the article does acknowledge, even though it undercuts the main point of the piece. The absurdity of that comparison was also not lost on Twitter:",

      "content": " A man who claimed earlier this week that he had been paid for sex by presidential candidate Kamala Harris now says he was hired for an acting role. Oh, and he claims now that he thought Harris was a fictional person, according to an exclusive interview with the Daily Beast. On Wednesday, 26-year-old personal trainer Sean Newaldass participated in a news conference organized by Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, two far-right conspiracy theorists who are already known for pushing\u00a0fraudulent claims. Newaldass read from a fact sheet about his alleged relationship with the California senator, which can be seen here,\u00a0and claimed he and Harris\u00a0had a total of 11 \u201csexual encounters\u201d in hotels in Iowa; Washington, D.C.; and New York City, according to the Daily Dot. Check out this video of the news conference \u2015 which is hilarious in its ineptness. On Friday, Newaldass told a much different story than the one he told on Wednesday. He said Wohl and Burkman hired him after he answered a CraigsList ad\u00a0seeking a \u201cmale actor\u201d for \u201cperformance art in DC.\u201d Newaldass said he believed the news conference was actually an audition for a Spike TV show that no longer exists. In fact, he had no clue Harris was a politician, much less a potential presidential candidate. \u201cI thought I was acting for a role in a movie, like a role in a TV series,\u201d Newaldass told the Daily Beast. \u201cI thought everything was staged, I\u2019m thinking everyone is an actor.\u201d Even more important:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m completely oblivious to who [Harris] is,\u201d Newaldass told the Daily Beast. Later in the interview, Newaldass admitted he\u2019s researched Harris since the news conference and now says he plans to vote for her. However, Newaldass said he regrets his part in the attempted smear because, like Harris, he is of mixed Indian and Caribbean ancestry. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s hurtful, because I\u2019m hurting my own ethnicity,\u201d Newaldass said. Newaldass said he was supposed to receive $500 for his services but hasn\u2019t yet. When the Daily Beast reached out to Wohl for his reaction, he responded cryptically with a laughing crying face emoji. HuffPost reached out to Wohl, but he didn\u2019t immediately respond. The smear against Harris was the latest to backfire for Wohl and Burkman. Earlier this month, the two dirty tricksters attempted to smear Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0of Massachusetts as a \u201ccougar\u201d by holding a news conference with a former Marine in his mid-20s who claimed he had a paid sexual affair with Warren, 70, that included bondage. Warren got the last laugh with a witty response that embraced her \u201ccougar\u201d past, telling the world it made her who she is.",

      "content": " The chairmen of three House committees announced Thursday that they\u2019ve subpoenaed Energy Secretary Rick Perry as part of their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The subpoena demands Perry turn over several documents concerning the Trump administration\u2019s communications with Ukraine and Trump pressuring the foreign power to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the president\u2019s political rivals. \u201cRecently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the President\u2019s stark message to the Ukrainian President,\u201d the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees wrote. \u201cThese reports have also raised significant questions about your efforts to press Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company to benefit individuals involved with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s push to get Ukrainian officials to interfere in our 2020 election,\u201d the letter to Perry said. Perry must comply by Oct. 18. The former Texas governor became publicly entangled in Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal last week after sources familiar with the situation spoke to Axios. They said that during a conference call with House Republicans on Friday, Trump said Perry arranged his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cNot a lot of people know this but, I didn\u2019t even want to make the call,\u201d Trump reportedly said, according to three sources. \u201cThe only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to. Something about an LNG [liquefied natural gas] plant.\u201d Department of Energy spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said the subpoena is \u201ccurrently under review by DOE\u2019s Office of General Counsel.\u201d The White House did not immediately return HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. Perry\u2019s subpoena is the latest the committees have issued as part of their impeachment inquiry. Others include those sent to the White House, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Vice President Mike Pence, the Pentagon and the budget office.

Trump is resisting an impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats after details of a call between Trump and the president of Ukraine emerged, showing his efforts to pressure the country into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Two whistleblowers within the intelligence community with knowledge of the July 25 call have filed complaints against the president, alleging that Trump inappropriately pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into interfering in U.S. politics. John Bolton replaced McMaster as the White House\u2019s national security adviser in April 2018 after reports suggested that the chief of staff John Kelly and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, both of whom have since resigned from their positions, were preparing to move McMaster out of his post.

      "title": "Mississippi Is About To Have An Election Under Jim Crow", 
      "content": " This fall in Mississippi, a group of elected officials could block the candidate who wins a majority of statewide votes from assuming the Governor\u2019s Mansion and the attorney general\u2019s office. And it would be completely legal. That\u2019s because of a long-overlooked provision in the state\u2019s 1890 Constitution. The measure requires candidates for statewide office to win not just a majority of the vote but also a majority of the 122 districts in the state House. If a candidate wins a majority of the statewide vote but not a majority of the districts, the members of the Republican-controlled\u00a0state\u00a0House choose who wins the election. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote, the Mississippi House of Representatives picks a winner from the two candidates who received the most votes. The provision has received little attention until recently, when four Black Mississippi voters filed a federal lawsuit arguing that it discriminates against African Americans. Although Black people make up 38% of the state, they are a majority in only 42 of the state\u2019s 122 House districts, according to NPR. The provision was part of an explicit effort during Mississippi\u2019s 1890 constitutional convention to suppress the Black vote, experts say, and has helped keep Black people out of statewide offices for years. It could do the same in the next election, when attorney general candidate Jennifer Riley Collins seeks to become the first Black statewide-elected official in nearly 150 years. Collins, a Democrat, along with gubernatorial candidate and current Attorney General Jim Hood (D), who is white, could win a majority of statewide gubernatorial votes but not a majority of the House districts. That\u2019s unless a federal judge strikes down the constitutional provision. A federal judge in Jackson is set to hear oral arguments in\u00a0McLemore v. Hosemann\u00a0on Friday. The four plaintiffs in the case are longtime Mississippi voters, two of whom had to pay poll taxes and three had to pass tests to register to vote decades ago. In court filings, their lawyers argue Mississippi\u2019s system for choosing statewide elected officials is both unconstitutional and illegal because Black-preferred candidates have to win more statewide votes than their white counterparts to get elected. The provision is rooted in efforts to suppress Black people. After the 15th Amendment prohibited officials from denying voting rights based on race, the Mississippi delegates who met in 1890 sought to limit the power of the newly enfranchised black population in the state. Along with the requirements for winning statewide office, they adopted measures like poll taxes and literacy tests that made it harder for Black people to vote. The plan succeeded and significantly reduced the number of eligible Black voters in the state. Mississippi hasn\u2019t elected an African American to statewide office in well over a century. \u201cThey focused on coming up with a particular means by which to achieve the goal of white supremacy without violating any federal constitutional safeguards. No other state had attempted that,\u201d said John Winkle III, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Mississippi. \u201cThat\u2019s the way the law was set in 1890, and it was clearly the product of the white supremacy overtones of the entire constitution itself.\u201d Over time, the federal courts and government got rid of poll taxes and literacy tests. But in Mississippi, the special conditions to win statewide office remained. Riley Collins, the Democratic candidate for attorney general, said it was obvious the provision in the state Constitution was only about race. \u201cThe crafters of that provision indicated that this was about limiting the power of Black [elected officials]. And so for someone to later try to be revisionist in history is not reading \u2015 they are not reading what the crafters themselves said,\u201d she said in an interview with HuffPost. \u201cWe can deny it all day \u2015 it is what it is.\u201d Even though the constitutional provision is obviously racist, it\u2019s gone unnoticed because it simply hasn\u2019t come into play in elections, Winkle said. One exception came in 1999, when none of the candidates running for governor won a majority of the vote. Lawmakers in the Mississippi House, then controlled by Democrats, chose the Democratic candidate, who was the one who had also earned the most votes in the election. The four plaintiffs seeking to overturn the provision argued the Mississippi Constitution establishes a structure that makes it harder for them to elect a candidate of their choice. They say the system denies them the opportunity to participate in the political process on equal ground with white people, regardless of which candidate wins an election. \u201cThe Popular-Vote Rule ensures that even when African-American-preferred candidates generate enough support to win a plurality of votes, they are unlikely to be elected,\u201d they wrote in the complaint they filed in May. \u201cThe House-Vote Rule ... thwarts the election of an African-American-preferred candidate by removing the selection of candidates for statewide office from the hands of the electorate and places the decision with the House, where African Americans have little influence.\u201d Lawyers representing the defendants, Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann and House Speaker Philip Gunn, both Republicans, conceded in their own court filings that the law has a discriminatory origin. But, they argue, the plaintiffs in the case are really claiming discrimination based on their political party, not race. The four Mississippi voters, they say, have not suffered any harm because the Mississippi Constitution has never prevented an \u201d\u2019African-American-preferred\u00a0candidate\u2019 who won the popular vote from taking office.\u201d \u201cNeither the Speaker nor the Secretary wish to defend the motivations behind a law\u00a0allegedly enacted with racial animus,\u201d the lawyers for state officials wrote in a July filing. \u201cHowever, both the allegations in the Complaint and the timing of its filing demonstrate that this lawsuit is not about race, and it is not about vindicating alleged wrongs to Plaintiffs\u2019 rights to vote \u2014 it\u2019s about partisan politics.\u201d Hood, the gubernatorial candidate, said politicians in the Mississippi Legislature shouldn\u2019t decide who the next governor of Mississippi will be. \u201cThe candidate with the most votes should win, period. Every Mississippian\u2019s vote should count. Those voters, not partisan politicians, should decide who they want to be their governor,\u201d Hood said in a statement. The suit is being backed by the Mississippi Center for Justice and the National Redistricting Foundation, which is affiliated with the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.",

It\u2019s covered by, in my view \u2015 the court may not agree \u2015 this is a civil rights issue protected by the Civil Rights Act,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we should be focusing on how to enforce that. My Justice Department \u2015 and I guess any one of the Democrats\u2019 Justice Department \u2015 will, in fact, do that.\u201d The Supreme Court is currently divided on\u00a0whether the Civil Rights Act, or Title VII, protects LGBTQ people from employment discrimination. A key part of the law bans job discrimination based on sex, though some courts in recent years have read the language to include discrimination against LGBTQ people as part of sex discrimination. Biden\u2019s answers to Judy Shepard\u2019s question were applauded, though the presidential candidate later caused a bit of discomfort in the audience after describing his first public statement supporting same-sex marriage in 2012 as when he \u201ccame out.\u201d \u201cFor example, when I came out and ... ,\u201d Biden said before catching himself and restarting with: \u201cWhen I publicly stated.\u201d \u201cComing out\u201d is a term often used to describe when someone chooses to publicly identify as LGBTQ.

      "title": "Former Watergate Prosecutors Say Trump Should Be Impeached", 
      "content": " A group of 17 former Justice Department special prosecutors who investigated the Watergate scandal said Thursday that they believe President Donald Trump has committed multiple impeachable offenses, drawing clear parallels between Trump\u2019s behavior and that of the late President Richard Nixon. In a\u00a0Washington Post op-ed, the group wrote that there is already \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence that Trump\u2019s actions warrant impeachment. They pointed to public statements made by the president and the White House\u2019s summary of his call\u00a0with the leader of Ukraine, both of which are driving the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry. \u201cThe Constitution establishes impeachment as the proper mechanism for addressing these abuses; therefore, the House should proceed with the impeachment process, fairly, openly and promptly,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cThe president\u2019s refusal to cooperate in confirming (or disputing) the facts already on the public record should not delay or frustrate the House\u2019s performance of its constitutional duty.\u201d Read the full commentary\u00a0here. The Watergate prosecutors repeatedly compared Trump to Nixon, who resigned after the House Judiciary Committee adopted three articles of impeachment against him: one for obstruction, one for abuse of power and one for contempt of Congress. \u201cIn our considered view, the same three articles of impeachment could be specified against Trump, as he has demonstrated serious and persistent abuses of power that in our view satisfy the constitutional standard of \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors,\u2019\u201d the op-ed reads. House Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry\u00a0last month following a whistleblower complaint about a call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. Also last month, the White House released a reconstruction of that conversation, during which Trump repeatedly pressed his counterpart to investigate a top political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden. The call took place days after Trump ordered his administration to withhold millions in American military aid that Congress had appropriated for Ukraine. Trump has denied stalling the funding in exchange for a political favor, but critics say his demand for a Biden investigation in the context of that withheld aid represents a clear quid pro quo. The members of the Watergate team also pointed to\u00a0text messages released by the chairs of three House committees last week that appear to show Trump administration officials pressuring a Ukrainian official for political favors in exchange for cooperation from the U.S. government. The former prosecutors wrote that recent efforts by the White House to stonewall Democrats\u2019 inquiries should not deter lawmakers, arguing that any impropriety by the president \u201crequires firm and resolute action.\u201d \u201cThe Constitution provides for the elected representatives of the people to resort to impeachment in extraordinary circumstances showing that this drastic remedy is necessary to restrain, and possibly remove, a president who has engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cLawmakers should not allow any refusal by the president to cooperate in its process to frustrate the performance of its constitutional duties.\u201d",

      "content": " Republican candidates and committees who benefited from allegedly illegal donations made by two clients of President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani are planning to donate them to charity. Those two clients, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, made straw donations in the name of others and operated as a front for an unknown Russian foreign national to donate to \u201cpoliticians and candidates for federal and state office,\u201d according to a federal indictment filed Thursday. Fruman and Parnas are reportedly deeply involved in the scheme concocted by Trump and Giuliani to pressure the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic nomination. They worked in both Ukraine and the U.S., often mixing politics with business, to gather information and influence politicians as part of Giuliani\u2019s efforts. This plan to get a foreign government to help Trump\u2019s reelection campaign is at the center of the House impeachment inquiry into the president. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) plans to give $111,000 \u2014 the amount Fruman and Parnas donated to a joint fundraising committee called Protect the House \u2014 to an as-yet-to-be-determined charity in his district. The National Republican Congressional Committee says it will donate contributions it received beyond those originally donated to Protect the House as well. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also plans to donate the $50,000 his 2018 campaign received from a shell company run by Fruman and Parnas, according to the Miami Herald. \u201cThe deception documented in today\u2019s indictment has no place in our country and as a result, McCarthy plans to donate amounts received to a local charity,\u201d Matt Sparks, a spokesman for McCarthy, said in an email. Starting in 2016, Fruman and Parnas contributed at least $955,000 to Republican candidates, committees and super PACs. The $325,000 contribution to America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC, made in the name of Global Energy Producers LLC in 2018 was the largest contribution made by Fruman and Parnas. The indictment charges the two businessmen with illegally masking their identities by contributing to the super PAC through a shell corporation. The indictment also mentions a $2,700 donation to Congressman-1, who has been identified by press reports as former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas). Fruman and Parnas promised to raise $20,000 for Sessions. Around the time of this promise, Sessions sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to fire the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, a major priority of Giuliani\u2019s influence campaign. The only other contributions specifically mentioned in the indictment are two $10,000 donations to Republican state candidates in Nevada. Fruman and Parnas made these allegedly illegal donations on behalf of a Russian national who was purportedly seeking to obtain a cannabis business license, according to the indictment. The only two Nevada candidates to receive contributions from Fruman or Parnas in 2018 were gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt and attorney general candidate Wes Duncan, according to state records. According to federal campaign finance records, Fruman and Parnas also donated $100,000 to House Majority Trust, another joint fundraising committee that worked to protect the Republican House majority in 2018; $15,000 to Sen. Rick Scott\u2019s (R-Fla.) joint fundraising committee; and $53,200 to committees connected with Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Protect the House divided contributions to the NRCC, McCarthy and his leadership PAC and over a dozen vulnerable House Republicans. House Majority Trust split its contributions between the Republican National Committee and the NRCC. The RNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it plans to return or donate the contributions.",

      "title": "How Trump Used The U.S. Government To Chase Conspiracy Theories", 
      "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has enlisted parts of the U.S. government and key allies in the pursuit of unproven or disproven conspiracy theories, some incubated in the dark and anonymous corners of the internet. Text messages between U.S. diplomats, a whistleblower complaint and a series of public statements by Trump and other officials in recent days offer the clearest view yet of the extent to which the president has used the government to chase accusations that secret forces have been plotting against him. Much of that evidence has surfaced because of an impeachment inquiry led by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Some of the evidence that has emerged shows that: - State Department envoys in Europe offered Ukraine\u2019s president a White House visit if he promised to investigate a discredited theory suggesting Russia did not interfere in the 2016 election that put Trump in office. A whistleblower complaint by an intelligence officer suggested Trump also held back nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine as additional leverage, which Trump has denied doing. - The Justice Department is now investigating its own probe into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and allegations that Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Moscow. Attorney General William Barr and another senior department official traveled to Europe in recent months to investigate the theory that the FBI investigation, first launched during the presidential campaign in 2016, was actually a plot to stop Trump from becoming president. The president\u2019s tendency to say untrue things, particularly on Twitter, has caused headaches for his administration before. Until now, however, the government had largely taken pains to distance itself from such statements. As recently as last year, the Justice Department argued in a series of court cases that when it came to national security, the president did not necessarily know what he was tweeting about. Here are the three cases in which Trump has publicly advanced views of uncorroborated conspiracies behind episodes damaging his presidency. The White House declined to comment on the cases: Investigations by U.S. intelligence, law enforcement, Congress and outside researchers have all concluded that Russia\u2019s government was to blame for hacking Democratic Party organizations and leaking stolen emails at politically opportune moments in 2016. Russia has denied involvement, although U.S. investigators even named the Russian officers who were sitting at the keyboard during the breaches. But another view has taken hold in on some right-wing websites. In that telling, the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the DNC hired to investigate the hack, falsely accused Russia, and spirited the hacked email servers to Ukraine as part of a coverup. As early as March 2017, an unnamed poster on the fringe website 4chan wrote that \u201cRussia could not have been the source of leaked Democrat emails released by WikiLeaks.\u201d Other posts incorrectly said CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is Ukrainian (he is a U.S. citizen born in Russia). Trump referenced that view during a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, mentioning CrowdStrike by name, and saying \u201cThe server they say Ukraine has it.\u201d Ahead of that call the U.S. special representative to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, suggested in a text message to a Zelenskiy aide that Zelenskiy might score a White House visit if he promised to \u201cget to the bottom of what happened\u201d in 2016, a reference to the election meddling. CrowdStrike said in a blog post that its finding of Russian involvement was supported by U.S. intelligence and that it never took possession of the hacked servers. Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, said officials in the administration tried to dissuade Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a conspiracy theory. It is completely debunked,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos\u201d last month. Russian involvement in the 2016 election produced an investigation like few others in U.S. history, focused on whether Trump\u2019s campaign had colluded with the Kremlin to win. Another theory, endorsed by Trump, holds that the probe was actually an elaborate effort by U.S. officials and foreign spies to deny him the presidency. The FBI opened its Russia probe in 2016, after an Australian diplomat reported that a Trump campaign aide named George Papadopoulos had boasted that Russia had obtained email \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, weeks before the hack of the Democratic National Committee became public. Papadopoulos told the FBI that he learned that from a Maltese academic, Joseph Mifsud. Papadopoulos has alleged that Mifsud was actually a Western intelligence operative trying to frame him, and by extension, Trump. On Twitter, Trump has hinted at that theory, repeating messages asking why Mifsud was not charged with a crime, and quoting a television interview in which Papadopoulos said the \u201cwhole thing was a complete setup.\u201d Now Barr is investigating how the government opened an investigation - which went on to be led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller - that the president dismissed as a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d from the start. Barr told CBS News that official explanations for the FBI\u2019s investigation \u201cdon\u2019t hang together.\u201d He has not elaborated on what he is investigating or why, but told a Senate subcommittee this year that \u201cthere is a basis for my concern.\u201d Barr traveled to Italy seeking information about Mifsud, and to the United Kingdom to meet with its intelligence officials. He has tapped the lead federal prosecutor in Connecticut to lead the review. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Trump\u2019s efforts to pursue those conspiracies came to light in large part because an unnamed U.S. intelligence officer filed a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelenskiy. Trump has accused Democrats of secretly ghostwriting the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. He described the whistleblower\u2019s sources as \u201cspying on our own president,\u201d and said they deserve \u201cBig Consequences.\u201d He also said on Wednesday that the Intelligence Committee Inspector General, who first reviewed the complaint and determined that it was credible and urgent, had presided over a \u201cscam.\u201d Trump also said his administration was \u201ctrying to find out\u201d the whistleblower\u2019s identity, and that he wanted to question his unnamed accuser. When the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers said a second official had also spoken to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, Trump said that person too was \u201ccoming in from the Deep State,\u201d a phrase that commonly refers to an alleged secret cabal within the U.S. government. One of the initial whistleblower\u2019s lawyers, Mark Zaid, has said that Congress did not help the whistleblower prepare the nine-page set of allegations that touched off the House impeachment inquiry. Nonetheless, Trump\u2019s allies in the House and his lawyers have taken up the accusation that the whistleblower worked in secret with the Democratic head of the House committee leading the impeachment inquiry, Adam Schiff. In a letter Tuesday, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone cited this among the president\u2019s reasons for refusing to cooperate with the impeachment probe. The whistleblower\u2019s party leanings and his contact with Democrats \u201craises serious questions that must be investigated,\u201d he wrote.

At least 10 cities have complained that the campaign has not paid them for police and fire department costs, totaling more than $840,000, according to a study this summer by the\u00a0Center for Public Integrity. The Trump campaign owes $569,000 to El Paso, Texas, for a rally there in February, local station CBS-4 TV reported earlier this month. The money represents 15% of the city\u2019s total debt. Earlier this week, Trump slammed Frey as a \u201cRadical Left Mayor\u201d out to squelch free speech.

      "content": " Rudy Giuliani was reportedly planning to leave Thursday for Vienna, Austria, a day after two business associates who helped him with his dealings with Ukraine officials were arrested as they were headed to the same destination. The Atlantic\u2019s Elaina Plott reported that Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, told her he would not be able to meet Thursday evening for an interview because he was planning to fly to Vienna in the evening. Giuliani told that to the reporter around the same time that his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested at Dulles International Airport while waiting to board a flight to Vienna with one-way international tickets Wednesday night, Plott wrote. Parnas and Fruman were headed to Vienna when they were arrested, The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier Thursday. The Southern District of New York indicted the two Soviet-born Florida businessmen on federal campaign finance charges for allegedly channeling foreign money and making fraudulent straw donations in order to hide their political contributions and give in excess of campaign contribution limits to Trump and other Republican candidates. According to Plott, Giuliani texted her late Thursday afternoon declining to comment on why Parnas and Fruman were headed to Vienna, and why he was planning to be there 24 hours later. In comments to the Journal, Giuliani said that while Parnas and Fruman were going to Vienna on issues \u201crelated to their business,\u201d he was only going to meet with them when they returned to Washington. As the Journal reported, the two men have introduced Giuliani to multiple current and former Ukrainian prosecutors to discuss his attempts at getting the country to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president about such an investigation is at the center of a House impeachment inquiry into him. Separately, House Democrats leading the inquiry issued subpoenas on Thursday to Parnas and Fruman for documents related to their work with Giuliani. Before their arrest, the House requested that Parnas appear for a deposition on Thursday and Fruman on Friday; their counsel declined the request earlier this week. Jay Sekulow, another of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, told reporters on Thursday that Trump has nothing to do with the businessmen\u2019s campaign finance schemes.

They were indicted on federal campaign finance charges that allege they conspired to funnel foreign money to pro-Trump and Republican groups and filed false disclosures about the hundreds of thousands of dollars in political contributions. Parnas and Fruman introduced Giuliani to top Ukrainian political circles, according to multiple\u00a0reports.\u00a0And Parnas told the Miami Herald\u00a0last month that he provided the Trump administration with information on alleged wrongdoing by Trump\u2019s 2020 rival\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and his son Hunter Biden, via his friendship with Giuliani. When quizzed by reporters on his relationship with the pair following their arrest Thursday, the president was on the defensive. \u201cI don\u2019t know those gentlemen. Now, it\u2019s possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody, I have a picture with everybody here, but somebody said there may be a picture or something at a fundraiser or somewhere, but I have pictures with everybody.

I just don\u2019t know.\u201d Images of Trump with the pair have since been circulated. One image, posted on Facebook by Parnas in May 2018, shows the businessman with Trump at the White House. He thanked the president for an \u201cincredible dinner and even better conversation.\u201d Parnas, Fruman, Giuliani and Trump are pictured together in an undated image published by the Miami Herald. Vice President Mike Pence was also pictured with the four of them at the event. Another image posted on Facebook by Parnas, also in May 2018, was captioned \u201cpower breakfast !!!\u201d and included a #Trump2020 hashtag. The photo shows Donald Trump Jr. with Fruman and Parnas at the Beverly Hills Polo Lounge. According to the indictment, Parnas and Fruman made a $325,000 contribution to an independent expenditure committee in May 2018 and falsely reported the source of the funds. The committee\u2019s name was not disclosed in the indictment, but it has been identified as America First Action, a group that supports pro-Trump political candidates. Some on social media were not satisfied with Trump\u2019s umbrella disclaimer that he did not know the pair but might have pictures with them, and some were quick to call out Trump\u2019s hypocritical\u00a0attack on former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0last week. The president had tweeted a doctored version of Nickelback\u2019s \u201cLook at This Photograph\u201d music video, which had been edited to include an old image of Joe Biden and his son alongside two associates, one of whom had been labeled as a \u201cUkrainian gas exec.\u201d The man was an American business partner of Hunter Biden\u2019s, and the two sat on the same board of a gas company in Ukraine. Trump\u2019s attack was meant to highlight Joe Biden\u2019s assertion he was not involved with his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.

He said that, although Democrats are focused on winning back the three longtime Democratic states Trump won in 2016 that gave him the presidency, they cannot afford to take Minnesota for granted, even if it hasn\u2019t voted Republican in a presidential race since Richard Nixon\u2019s reelection in 1972. \u201cDonald Trump can lose Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania but win Minnesota and get reelected,\u201d he said. Munson, from the town of St. Michael, about 45 minutes northwest of Minneapolis, had plenty of company Thursday evening by way of devotion to Donald Trump. Jill Simons, a 46-year-old pediatrician, came from Edina, about 20 minutes southwest of the Target Center. She said she is not bothered by his asking Ukraine to investigate political opponent Joe Biden: \u201cI think he has a right to.\u201d Dustin Kluge, a 21-year-old Air Force airman who came to the rally wearing a \u201cSpace Force\u201d T-shirt that Trump\u2019s campaign has been selling since last year, said Trump was justified in asking a foreign government for help since all politicians do it. Nancy Vergin, who drove three hours from her home in Benson near the South Dakota border, called the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry \u201cstupid\u201d and said she knew it would not succeed. \u201cThey can\u2019t win at the ballot box.\u201d During 102 minutes of remarks, Trump hit those themes and more, and in the tone that his fans love. On Joe and Hunter Biden: \u201cHunter, you\u2019re a loser. Why did you get $1.5 billion, Hunter? And your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d On a protester in the stands: \u201cGo home to Mommy.\u201d On accepting refugees in the United States: \u201cWe are keeping extremists, criminals and terrorists the hell out of our country.\u201d On the news media: \u201cThese are very dishonest people. You understand that.\u201d On his border wall: \u201cThat sucker is going up. It is the strongest. It is the finest. It\u2019s steel. It\u2019s hardened concrete. It\u2019s deep. It\u2019s high. It\u2019s a thing of beauty. And it\u2019s going to keep criminal aliens out of our country.\u201d On Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose district encompasses the Target Center: \u201cCongresswoman Omar is an America-hating socialist.\u201d Trump even suggested that a backlash against Omar would help him win the state next year: \u201cShe is a big reason that I am going to win, and the Republican Party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months.\u201d Tom Craft, a 37-year-old information technology consultant who most certainly was not attending the Trump rally, is not buying it. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance he\u2019s going to win Minnesota,\u201d he said, adding that he understands why so many cultural conservatives support him because he grew up in the rural, central part of the state. But even Republicans he knows in the city and suburbs who gave him a shot in 2016 have had enough of all the chaos. \u201cI think Trump\u2019s delusional.\u201d As she introduced Second Lady Karen Pence at a \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d gathering in neighboring St. Paul on Wednesday, state Republican Party chairwoman Jennifer Carnahan reminded the 250 or so who turned out that Democrats have won Minnesota in every presidential election since 1976 \u2015 but that Trump came within 45,000 votes of winning without even trying very hard. \u201cWe have an incredible opportunity in 2020 to turn that tide,\u201d she said. Doing so would be a major step toward delivering Trump a second term. Trump won 36 more electoral votes than he needed in 2016, but 46 of them came thanks to a total victory margin of 77,744 votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan \u2015 an average margin of 0.6%. Since then, a slowing economy caused in large part by Trump\u2019s trade war has put those states in jeopardy for him. If he loses all three, and every other state goes the same way it did in 2016, Trump would fall 10 votes short of an Electoral College victory. And while the Trump campaign is also pushing hard in other states it narrowly lost \u2015 New Hampshire and Nevada \u2015 neither of them by itself would be enough to put Trump over the top. Minnesota would. Murtaugh said the Trump campaign fully intends to win Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Minnesota would simply remove all doubt. \u201cIf we win Minnesota, it\u2019s lights out.\u201d Of course, Trump received only 2,000 more votes in Minnesota in 2016 than Mitt Romney did in 2012. The difference between former President Barack Obama\u2019s easy victory and Hillary Clinton\u2019s narrow win was a drop-off of nearly 200,000 Democratic votes. What\u2019s more, between 2016 and now, Minnesota has already had a statewide election: the midterm a year ago, when Democrats comfortably won both U.S. Senate seats and the governor\u2019s race. They also easily unseated two Republican House members in the Twin Cities suburbs while losing two open Democratic House seats \u2015 one by just 1,315 votes \u2015 in rural areas. The main factor energizing Democratic voters in the suburbs has been Trump\u2019s erratic behavior and untempered language, characteristics that Trump appears to see as a positive feature and continues to exhibit, particularly at rallies. Democratic pollster Peter Hart estimated that Trump\u2019s hardcore base, those who will stick with him no matter what, probably represents no more than 9% of the total electorate. Hart said that appealing to that slice made sense in a crowded primary, such as Trump faced in 2016, but is counterproductive in a general election. \u201cHard to get a majority with that approach,\u201d Hart said. The Trump campaign tacitly acknowledges that with its \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d series of discussions, which pushes a quieter message that essentially tells women alarmed by Trump to ignore him and instead focus on things like the unemployment rate. \u201cWe know, it\u2019s not so easy sometimes to be a Trump supporter,\u201d said Lara Trump, wife of the president\u2019s son Eric, at the Wednesday gathering. Both she and Karen Pence told their audience in St. Paul that touting the strong economy might be the best tactic. \u201cThis is a president that cares about your pocketbook,\u201d Pence said.",

The 2020 Democrat, who is the first openly gay man to run for president, was asked at the town hall hosted by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign what he would do about the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s blood donation policy that prohibits cis men who have had sex with cis men in the past 12 months from giving blood. Buttigieg responded by speaking about his own experience as a gay man leading South Bend\u2019s annual blood drive. \u201cI remember the moment when I realized that, unlike most initiatives that I spearhead, I can\u2019t lead by example on this one, because my blood\u2019s not welcome in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not based on science; it\u2019s based on prejudice.\u201d The mayor said as president he would have the FDA revise its rules \u201cbased on evidence, based on individual risk factors and without regard to the prejudice that has driven the current policy.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s appearance Thursday night in Los Angeles was a historic one, as an openly gay presidential candidate being moderated by Anderson Cooper, an openly gay journalist, at a town hall specifically dedicated to issues within the LGBTQ community. Buttigieg\u2019s coming out experience happened after he came back from deployment in Afghanistan and when he had already been elected mayor, he said. The 37-year-old Indiana native told his story of coming out at last month\u2019s Democratic debate, marking the first time in American history that the public had heard a presidential candidate openly talk about their coming out experience. Cooper asked Buttigieg on Thursday what his earlier years were like when he first realizing he was gay. \u201cWhat it was like was a civil war, because I knew I was different long before I was ready to say that I was gay and long before I was able to acknowledge that that was something that I didn\u2019t have power over,\u201d he responded. \u201cI so admire people who are coming out at young ages but also recognize that there\u2019s no right age or right way or right time to come out,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people are ready when they\u2019re ready. And for me, I was well into my 20s before I was really ready to say even to myself that I was gay.\u201d Buttigieg has previously talked about his \u201cinternal war,\u201d and his journey toward accepting and being proud of his sexuality. The town hall occurred the same day Buttigieg unveiled his sweeping LGBTQ plan, which includes tackling HIV/AIDS, overturning the transgender military ban and securing the passage of the Equality Act, which amends the Civil Rights Act to specifically ban discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.",

The former vice president made the comments to CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, who was moderating the Los Angeles town hall event, a forum for nine Democratic presidential candidates to discuss LGBTQ issues. After going on a tangent about stereotypes surrounding gay people, Biden concluded with a reflection on how the discourse about homosexuality had changed in recent years, compared with about two decades ago: \u201cRemember, Anderson? Back 15, 20 years ago, when we talked about this in San Francisco, it was all about,\u00a0well, gay bathhouses.\u00a0It was all about round-the-clock sex.\u00a0Come on, man.\u00a0Gay couples are more likely to stay together longer than heterosexual couples,\u201d he said.

At one point, he referenced a time when he \u201ccame out\u201d but rolled with the joke and walked across the stage to put his arm around Cooper, who is gay. \u201cWell, that would be news,\u201d Cooper joked back. \u201cI kind of figured it out a while ago.\u201d People on Twitter were very confused by, well, all of it.

They\u2019re trying, they\u2019re not getting very far,\u201d said Trump, who spent a majority of the rally going off-script. \u201cThey want to erase your vote like it never existed, they want to erase your voice and they want to erase your future. But they will fail because in America the people rule again.\u201d Thursday\u2019s event was the first since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opened a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s July 25 call with the leader of Ukraine. During the conversation, Trump repeatedly pressed his counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate one of his prime political rivals, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden. Trump has maintained he did nothing wrong and has vehemently rejected assertions that he asked for a quid pro quo\u00a0for releasing already-appropriated military aid to Ukraine. The president continued to attack the Bidens on Thursday, saying, without evidence, that they \u201cgot rich\u201d and \u201csold out America\u201d during the last administration. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company for a five-year period that ended in early 2019, but neither Biden has been accused of any wrongdoing. \u201cHe was never considered smart,\u201d Trump said of Joe Biden. \u201cHe was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d \u201cTrue,\u201d Trump said to a cheering crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Biden, who spent the evening at a Human Rights Campaign event focused on LGBTQ issues, decried Trump\u2019s message later that evening, saying America was \u201cso much stronger than your weakness.\u201d Trump also took aim at Pelosi, a frequent target of his ire, saying she was \u201ceither really stupid\u201d or had \u201creally lost it\u201d when she announced the impeachment inquiry. \u201cOr maybe there\u2019s a certain dishonesty in there,\u201d he said. During one of the president\u2019s more venomous attacks, Trump took aim at Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar (D), calling her an \u201cAmerica-hating socialist\u201d who was a \u201cdisgrace to our country.\u201d \u201cHow do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota? I\u2019m very angry at you people right now,\u201d Trump said of the freshman congresswoman. \u201cShe is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that I am going to win and the Republican Party is going to win Minnesota.\u201d Trump regularly turned from the teleprompter during the event, saying it was \u201cmuch better when I go off-script.\u201d During one such instance, he also acted out a bizarre conversation between former FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page. Thursday\u2019s rally was emblematic of Trump\u2019s latest attempts to turn the momentum behind the impeachment inquiry to favor his own political agenda. The White House has refused to comply with the House\u2019s investigations, and the president\u2019s campaign has been fundraising en masse since Pelosi first announced the impeachment proceedings. House Democrats, however, have remained undeterred, firing off subpoenas targeting many current and former Trump administration officials while telling the president that no one is above the law.

The rule, which was finalized in August, vastly expanded who could be considered a possible \u201cpublic charge\u201d from someone who would be primarily dependent on the government to someone who might at some point need government help such as food stamps or housing vouchers. The Department of Homeland Security rule, pushed by Trump\u2019s leading aide on immigration, Stephen Miller, was due to go into effect on Oct. 15. It will now be on hold while legal challenges against it proceed. Judge George Daniels of the Southern District of New York, issued a nationwide block of the rule, writing that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and would suffer \u201cirreparable harm\u201d if the rule were to go into effect. He wrote the government had failed to demonstrate why the current approach was inadequate. The rule, if it is ultimately allowed to go into effect, could be the most drastic of the Trump administration\u2019s policies targeting the legal immigration system, experts have said. \u00a0The government has argued the rule is necessary to better ensure that immigrants will be self-sufficient. \u201cThe public charge standard was never intended to exclude working class immigrants from developing countries,\u201d said Charles Wheeler, an attorney with the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, which is a plaintiff in the case. \u201cThis ruling confirms that the American dream remains open to them.\u201d Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, Daniel Trotta and Kristina Cooke.

      "content": " The man accused of shooting two people to death in Halle, Germany, this week shares a lot of characteristics with American mass shooters: He\u2019s a bigot with delusions of grandeur, and is part of an online community that fervently supports his hate. But one thing that set him apart \u2015 and likely curbed the death toll in Wednesday\u2019s shootings outside a synagogue \u2015 was his choice of weapons. Police say he was armed with homemade guns that jammed repeatedly during the attack. American mass killers, on the other hand, typically strike with a cache of military-grade, semiautomatic weaponry. That\u2019s in part due to Germany\u2019s strict gun laws. Had the Halle shooter had access to better guns, the bloodshed could have been much worse, experts said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that if he had access to better weapons, the body count would have been higher,\u201d said Vegas Tenold, a journalist and author with the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism. Tenold tweeted a photo of the shooter\u2019s slam-bang tube, adding, \u201cThis is a direct result of Germany\u2019s strict gun laws.\u201d The shooter, in a gruesome, 36-minute video livestreamed on Twitch, used his improvised guns to kill two people after failing to get inside a synagogue filled with Yom Kippur worshippers. His guns \u2015 including a so-called slam-bang tube and a homemade 9mm rifle \u2015 repeatedly jammed or failed to fire as he attempted to shoot. He said he wanted to prove the effectiveness of rudimentary weapons in a country that makes it hard to obtain semiautomatic guns. Germany has some of the world\u2019s strictest gun laws. All gun ownership is heavily regulated,\u00a0and each legal purchase comes with a background check that considers addiction, mental health history, and criminal record. Gun buyers under 25 have to pass a psychological exam, and semiautomatic gun ownership requires special authorization. German gun laws were tightened after school shootings in 2002 and 2009. In turn, shooting incidents dropped dramatically, according to The Washington Post. Illegal weaponry and DIY guns are still a threat across much of Europe. But shooters need criminal connections to get their hands on semiautomatic firepower that is commonplace in America, said Nils Duquet, a weapons expert in Belgium with Flemish Peace Institute. \u201cIf you want to buy an illegal gun in Europe, what\u2019s important is having the right networks. For assault rifles, you need better criminal connections,\u201d Duquet told The Washington Post.\u00a0\u201cBut there are many hot spots in Europe where you can try, and that is what\u2019s worrying.\u201d America\u2019s gun laws, along with war-torn Yemen\u2019s, are the world\u2019s loosest. The U.S. is\u00a0averaging more than one mass shooting per day this year. According to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive, 329 mass shootings \u2015 defined as an incident in which four people or more are shot, excluding the shooter \u2015 have occurred in the U.S. in 2019. Military-grade, semiautomatic rifles are often easier to obtain in the U.S. than handguns, and they kill twice as many people as other types of weapons,\u00a0according to researchers. \u201cActive shooters are hell-bent on killing people,\u201d Dr. Adil Haider, a trauma surgeon who was the lead author of a 2018 study on weapons used in \u201cactive shooter\u201d incidents, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe big difference \u2014 and this is not such a big surprise \u2014 is if you give them a semiautomatic, they\u2019re able to shoot twice the number of people.\u201d",

      "title": "A Progressive Congressman\u2019s Oversight Of Donald Trump Inspires Challenge From The Left", 
      "content": " The case for some progressive primary challenges is obvious. Those are the races where an incumbent Democrat in a safe seat has racked up a conservative voting record out of step with their constituents, used their seat for self-enrichment, or otherwise lost touch with their district. The theory behind challenging Rep. Peter DeFazio, 72, who has, since 1987, represented a seat in rural Oregon that now leans just barely Democratic, is more complex. DeFazio, who now serves as chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and longtime supporter of, among other progressive touchstones, \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d single-payer health care. But Doyle Canning, a 39-year-old community organizer and attorney who has announced a primary challenge against DeFazio, insists that the veteran congressman is past his expiration date. Canning, who hails from the liberal college town of Eugene, has some standard policy differences with DeFazio. Unlike the incumbent congressman in Oregon\u2019s 4th Congressional District, she supports House Democrats\u2019 legislation banning military-style \u201cassault\u201d rifles. She is also refusing to accept contributions from corporate political action committees, something DeFazio receives in abundance. Her hardest-hitting critique, however, is that as a committee chair, DeFazio has been milquetoast in his dealings with, and oversight of, the Trump administration. \u201cThis race is about the future \u2015 of our district, of the country and of the Democratic Party,\u201d Canning told HuffPost. \u201cAnd we need leadership that is willing to take a stand against the corruption of the Trump administration.\u201d DeFazio\u2019s Transportation Committee is charged with oversight of federal government buildings, including the building that houses the Trump International Hotel in Washington; airplane manufacturers and the Federal Aviation Administration; and the conduct of the Secretary of Transportation. At one point or another in the past year, DeFazio has faced accusations of falling short in each of those three areas. DeFazio provided a lengthy statement defending his committee\u2019s oversight; HuffPost also spoke to committee staff about their work. \u201cI am running aggressive investigations to get answers about any number of Trump administration actions that fall within my Committee\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d he said. Following a second major Boeing plane crash in March, which killed over 150 people, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded three of the manufacturer\u2019s commercial airliners. The tragic crash prompted major questions about why the FAA, under Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao\u2019s supervision, had failed to prevent the crashes. At the time, DeFazio suggested he would stop at nothing to obtain relevant communications about the scandal from both Boeing and the FAA. By early May, it emerged that Boeing knew about the absence of a warning light in one of the deadly planes, but delayed informing authorities, because it considered the light an optional feature available to customers paying a higher premium. But later that month, at a hearing on the crashes with Trump\u2019s acting head of the FAA, DeFazio admitted that he still didn\u2019t have the documents and did nothing to indicate he plans to use his subpoena power to get them. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that they will provide the documents we have requested voluntarily and in the not-too-distant future,\u201d he said. In a May essay, Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, which monitors executive branch corruption, accused DeFazio of taking a softer line than Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who chairs the subcommittee on aviation and space. \u201cWe have had no serious inquiry into the collapse of government oversight of planes,\u201d Hauser told HuffPost. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dennis Muilenburg is due to testify before DeFazio\u2019s committee on Oct. 30 \u2015 more than seven months after the plane crash that prompted the FAA to ground planes. Matt Stoller, author of the forthcoming book\u00a0\u201cGoliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy,\u201d characterized DeFazio\u2019s chairmanship unfavorably when compared to, among other colleagues, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline\u2019s chairmanship of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel. \u201cCicilline is doing a great job investigating big tech. DeFazio needs to show that same urgency in investigating Boeing,\u201d said Stoller, a former congressional aide, who now serves as a fellow at the antitrust-focused Open Markets Institute. \u201cBeing the party of the people means carrying on the legacy of [former California Rep.] Henry Waxman and [former Arkansas Rep.] Wright Patman, people who knew how to uncover the secrets powerful people don\u2019t want the public to know.\u201d Members of DeFazio\u2019s committee staff told HuffPost that they are now sifting through hundreds of thousands of documents that they have obtained since May from both Boeing and the FAA. To call Muilenburg, the Boeing CEO, before the committee prior to obtaining those documents would waste the opportunity to grill him in a more informed way, they argued. They also said that forcing disclosure of documents through subpoenas could have delayed the process further by tying the committee up in court with legal challenges. Hauser did not buy those arguments. He maintains that there is no way to know whether documents shared voluntarily are as definitive as those that Boeing and the FAA would reveal if they had no choice. And he noted that the committee could have called Muilenburg in early on, when the political urgency was greatest, then recalled him a second time once the committee had assembled more documents. \u201cBoeing is definitely happy with Chairman DeFazio\u2019s oversight,\u201d Hauser said. \u201cThe question is whether Chairman DeFazio is happy about that.\u201d In his statement to HuffPost, DeFazio said that he was prioritizing substance over style. He noted that the has already held three hearings on the crashes, which have featured current and former Boeing employees, FAA officials and whistleblowers. \u201cMy record on safety and oversight is vast and determination dogged,\u201d he said, citing his work on the ValuJet crash in the 1990s. \u201cAnyone who knows my record knows that I fight for real results, not empty rhetoric.\u201d Then there is the matter of DeFazio\u2019s relative inactivity in response to Secretary Chao\u2019s shady conduct. Chao is both the daughter of James Chao, a major Chinese shipping magnate, and the husband of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Politico reported in May that Chao has made a series of appearances indirectly promoting the company her father founded while serving as head of a federal agency overseeing the declining U.S. shipping industry in direct competition with companies like her family\u2019s. Another Politico report just last week found that 25% of Chao\u2019s meetings with local officials were with people from Kentucky, the state her husband represents in the Senate. The House Oversight and Reform Committee, which has broad supervision of the executive branch, has initiated an investigation into Chao\u2019s conduct related to her family\u2019s company, sending a letter to Chao in mid-September demanding documents related to her communication with the company. But DeFazio\u2019s transportation committee, which has a narrower focus on Chao and her agency, has yet to pursue comparable action. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee staff members who spoke to HuffPost said that given the committee\u2019s resources it is letting the Oversight Committee take the lead on investigating Chao\u2019s ethical queries, though it is acting in a supporting capacity. DeFazio\u2019s committee is also in touch with the Department of Transportation\u2019s inspector general to decide its next steps. Hauser, of the Revolving Door Project, considers it \u201cfeckless\u201d that DeFazio has not called on Chao to testify before the committee either about Boeing, her own conduct or any other matter. (Committee staff said they would not hesitate to call Chao before the committee if they considered it necessary.) Critics of DeFazio\u2019s tenure felt as though they had come across the secret to his motives in a Washington Post article at the end of August, which addressed a supposed lack of progress in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee\u2019s investigations into the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Trump built the hotel in the Old Post Office Building, which he is leasing from the federal government. That means that DeFazio\u2019s panel has oversight over Trump\u2019s apparent use of the hotel as a vehicle for self-enrichment over the course of his presidency. In the Post story, Rep. Dina Titus (D-Nev.), chair of the subcommittee overseeing the hotel, suggested that DeFazio was treading carefully in his investigations into the hotel in the hopes of negotiating infrastructure legislation with Trump. Titus subsequently took back the remarks, claiming the article \u201cmischaracterizes\u201d the progress that DeFazio\u2019s committee has made. Shortly after the Post story came out, Titus joined a press release with DeFazio \u201ccorrecting the record\u201d on the committee\u2019s work. The heart of the investigation, which began after Trump was elected in November 2016, entails requiring the General Services Administration, the agency that manages federal government buildings, to conduct an audit of the hotel. In his statement to HuffPost, DeFazio said that the GSA has handed over thousands of documents, but is still withholding many. He has given the administration a deadline to hand over the remainder and he will \u201cnot hesitate\u201d to use his subpoena power to compel their release. The challenge for Canning is making the charges against DeFazio stick in a largely rural district that Democrats are hanging on to by a thread. Oregon\u2019s 4th covers a large tract of land in the southwestern corner of the state, which was once home to a thriving timber industry. Eugene, which is home to the University of Oregon, and Corvallis, which is home to Oregon State, are blue dots in a sea of rural red terrain. As rural Oregon, like rural America, has trended away from Democrats, DeFazio has defied the fate of national Democrats. In 2016, DeFazio was re-elected by 16 percentage points, but Hillary Clinton edged out Trump in the same district by a mere 0.1 points. Canning, whose husband works at the University of Oregon, in many ways embodies the political leanings of the district\u2019s liberal population hubs. She is a co-founder of the Center for Story-Based Strategy, a nonprofit that seeks to advance progressive causes through storytelling, and she has previously worked for an environmental justice organization that fights the racially disparate impacts of ecological depradation. Like many Democrats furious about Trump\u2019s corruption and racism, Canning is calling for a sense of urgency to match the moment, including ruling out any significant cooperation with the administration until Trump is impeached. She took DeFazio to task on Twitter for suggesting that work on a federal highway bill, which would necessarily be bipartisan in order to pass, would proceed apace. DeFazio campaign manager Carly Gabrielson dismissed the criticism as contrary to Canning\u2019s goals of taking action against climate change. \u201cUnder the Chairman\u2019s direction, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is moving legislation to implement the goals of the Green New Deal\u2014 goals that Doyle Canning claims to share, yet at the same time she believes that business should stop while Congress investigates Trump?\u201d Gabrielson said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways, and frankly it\u2019s an absurd position.\u201d HuffPost pressed Canning on the difficulty of prevailing against DeFazio in a rural swing seat. Canning responded that, like many progressive challengers before her, she is betting that a principled fighter is capable of expanding the electorate by turning out nonvoters. Among other groups, she wants to appeal to the growing number of eligible Latinx voters who moved to the district for work. \u201cWe\u2019re building a coalition of the new face of the Democratic Party,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s younger, it\u2019s more diverse, it\u2019s more feminist, and it looks different than it did in \u201986.\u201d",

      "author": "Jessica Schulberg", 
      "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/betty-mccollum-minnesota-israeli-palestinian_n_5d926349e4b0e9e760514c1f", 
      "title": "The Minnesota Congresswoman Who Can Criticize Israel", 
      "content": " Over the past few years, one member of Congress has stood up to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), denounced Israel\u2019s policies, which she likened to \u201capartheid,\u201d and pushed laws that would place humanitarian conditions on U.S. military aid to Israel. Human rights advocates praise her, and she is popular in her progressive district. But she is neither the face of the progressive left nor the bogeyman of Fox News. Unless you\u2019ve lived in Minnesota \u2014 or read MinnPost \u2014 there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve never heard of her. Her name is Betty McCollum, and she has represented St. Paul for almost 20 years. President Donald Trump \u2014 who loves to attack Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), one of the first Muslim congresswomen, for her criticism of Israel \u2014 has never once tweeted McCollum\u2019s name. That the Democratic congresswoman who leads the vanguard of progressive U.S. policy toward Israel in Congress is not the subject of constant bad-faith attacks from the right is a testament to her pragmatism. But it also exposes the inconsistency of the outrage campaign directed at Omar and the other members of the so-called \u201cSquad,\u201d a group of progressive first-term lawmakers who are all women of color. \u201cRep. Omar has a history of launching virulent anti-Semitic screeds,\u201d Trump claimed at a campaign rally in Minneapolis on Thursday. \u201cShe is a disgrace to our country and she is one of the big reasons that I am going to win and the Republican Party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months,\u201d he continued. Trump\u2019s attacks on the Squad, which also includes Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), \u201care intentionally done to rile up the racist instincts of a portion of his base,\u201d said Dylan Williams, of the left-leaning pro-Israel group J Street. \u201cThis double standard that\u2019s being applied to these congresswomen is very clear, and it\u2019s not a standard that has been applied to other congressional critics of Israeli policy and the occupation.\u201d Omar, who is Black, Muslim and an immigrant from Somalia, represents \u201ca perfect storm of characteristics that they could try to attack and portray as the problem to a white evangelical base,\u201d said Yousef Munayyer, the executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights. \u201cRep. McCollum,\u201d Munayyer added, \u201cdidn\u2019t fit the poster.\u201d McCollum, who grew up in South St. Paul, trained as a social studies teacher. After she graduated, she had a hard time finding full-time work, so she took on long-term substitute teaching jobs and worked part-time at Sears. In 1984, McCollum\u2019s toddler daughter fractured her skull falling off a playground slide that didn\u2019t have enough sand at its base. The girl recovered quickly, but the city didn\u2019t do anything about the playground until after McCollum pushed for it at a City Council meeting \u2014 a victory that prompted her to run for local office. She served on the City Council and in the Minnesota statehouse before she was elected to Congress in 2000. There is no one moment that prompted McCollum to become one of the most outspoken members of Congress on Israel and Palestine. She tends to talk about the conflict as just one of the many human rights crises bedeviling the world. As a lawmaker, she has shown a particular interest in policy aimed at protecting vulnerable kids: She has worked to provide HIV-AIDS assistance to orphans, prevent child marriage\u00a0and fix crumbling schools for Native American children. In 2006, representatives of groups that provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians warned McCollum of a looming humanitarian disaster. At the time, lawmakers were preparing to vote on the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act, a bill ostensibly intended to isolate Hamas, the group that has been designated by Israel and the U.S. as a terrorist organization and that had recently won a majority in the Palestinian parliament. The bill, humanitarian workers explained, would make it harder for aid organizations to provide lifesaving medical care to Palestinians. McCollum listened and was one of two members who voted against advancing the bill out of committee. The bill, which was backed by AIPAC, passed easily in the House. But McCollum\u2019s dissenting vote set her up for a feud with one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the country. On a Friday after the vote, McCollum\u2019s chief of staff, Bill Harper, got a phone call from Amy Rotenberg, an AIPAC member who had met with McCollum on behalf of the organization. McCollum\u2019s \u201csupport for terrorists will not be tolerated,\u201d Rotenberg said, according to Harper.\u00a0Rotenberg,\u00a0who declined an interview, described Harper\u2019s characterization of the conversation as a \u201cserious distortion.\u201d \u201cBill Harper\u2019s description of the conversation with me was false in 2006 and it is false now,\u201d Rotenberg wrote. McCollum was shocked. She wrote a letter to AIPAC\u2019s executive director slamming the group for attempting to use \u201cthreat and intimidation to stifle legitimate policy differences.\u201d She banned AIPAC representatives from her offices pending a formal apology from the lobbying group. It was a lonely time to go up against AIPAC. J Street, the left-leaning alternative to AIPAC, didn\u2019t exist yet. Members told McCollum that she had \u201cwritten her death sentence,\u201d she said. \u201cI went, \u2018OK, if I lose an election over standing up for medical supplies for kids, OK, I\u2019m ready to go!\u2019\u201d McCollum said. \u201cWhen I came back, the whisper kind of was, \u2018You can survive!\u2019\u201d McCollum never got a public apology, but she did eventually let AIPAC representatives back into her office. \u201cBut they don\u2019t bully her or do what they do to other members,\u201d said Brad Parker, a senior adviser at Defense for Children International Palestine. McCollum wins reelections in her progressive district by huge margins \u2014 she received 91% of the vote in the 2018 primary and beat her Republican opponent by 36 percentage points. She has no interest in running for Senate, she said. In 2015, when a group of activists started organizing in opposition to Israel\u2019s military detention of Palestinian children, McCollum\u2019s office was one of the first places they visited on Capitol Hill. Palestinian human rights is an outlier issue on Capitol Hill \u2014 \u201cYou don\u2019t even have access to a lot of offices; they don\u2019t want to deal with Palestinian organizations,\u201d said Parker, whose group briefed McCollum\u2019s team on the issue. \u201cThose barriers don\u2019t exist with Betty.\u201d They showed McCollum\u2019s team a\u00a02013 UNICEF report that described Israeli soldiers removing Palestinian kids from their homes in the middle of the night, blindfolding them and taking them to an interrogation center. The kids were beaten, deprived of sleep and forced to sign confessions in a language they did not understand, without a lawyer present, the report said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Wait a second. We\u2019re giving money, the U.S. government, to UNICEF, to do this report \u2014 and we\u2019re giving money to the Israeli government to do the things that the report is about,\u2019\u201d Harper, McCollum\u2019s chief of staff, said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this picture?\u201d The U.S. currently gives Israel $3.8 billion a year in military aid. Since World War II, it has received more U.S. foreign assistance than any other country, according to the Congressional Research Service. Most countries that receive U.S. assistance are subject to extensive restrictions on how the aid is used. But for Israel, much of the money goes directly into its Ministry of Defense, with little American oversight, Harper said. In 2017, McCollum introduced a bill to block U.S. aid to Israel from being used to \u201csupport the military detention, interrogation, abuse, or ill-treatment of Palestinian children in violation of international humanitarian law.\u201d She reintroduced the bill in April, this time with language that would amend the so-called Leahy law, which prohibits the U.S. from providing military assistance to foreign governments that commit \u201ca gross violation of human rights.\u201d The current bill would also set aside money to fund nongovernmental organizations that provide physical, psychological and emotional treatment for Palestinian children who have been detained by the Israeli military. Last March, the Minnesota delegation of American Muslims for Palestine traveled to Washington to meet with McCollum and talk about her bill. At the end of the meeting, McCollum tweeted out a picture of her posing with the group. The congresswoman didn\u2019t think much of it \u2014 she tweets pictures of groups she meets with all the time. But Palestinian activists are used to being ignored by their elected officials, AMP chapter lead Mariam El-Khatib said. When El-Khatib saw the tweet, she thought, \u201cWow, she doesn\u2019t mind being associated with AMP or Palestinians doing this kind of work.\u201d The bill has 21 co-sponsors, all Democrats. Two additional Democrats withdrew their names as co-sponsors. When Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) pulled her name, she tweeted that her \u201cheart has always been with the children of Palestine\u201d and that she was pushing leadership \u201chard\u201d for a vote on a \u201cresolution supporting a two-state solution.\u201d McCollum pushed back: \u201cRep. Dingell removed her name from HR 2407, calling it \u2018counterproductive to a peaceful, two-state solution,\u2019\u201d McCollum tweeted. \u201cDoes ongoing U.S. funding for Israeli military detention and abuse of Palestinian children promote peace or human rights violations?\u201d McCollum estimates that if all of the members who told her in private they liked the bill were willing to support it publicly, she\u2019d have another 20 co-sponsors. But she also knows the bill has almost no chance of making it out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, headed by the staunchly pro-Israel Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) \u2014 much less becoming law. Engel and Dingell\u00a0did not respond to requests for comment. \u201cIt\u2019s the obvious bill that still won\u2019t get passed,\u201d said Jaylani Hussein, head of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Last year, McCollum accepted an award from the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights. During her acceptance speech, she described Israel\u2019s nation-state law \u2014 which reserves the right to self-determination in Israel for Jewish people \u2014 as a system of apartheid. For a sitting member of Congress to use the word \u201capartheid\u201d in reference to Israel is radical \u2014 almost inconceivable. But her comments attracted almost no national attention. With the exception of fringe actors, such as Zionist Organization of American President Mort Klein, most of the people from the pro-Israel community who weighed in on her speech offered measured criticism. Steve Hunegs, of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas, expressed disappointment with her word choice and her decision to attend the event, but he also emphasized her past support for a two-state solution. He didn\u2019t accuse her of anti-Semitism. McCollum thinks the conversation about Israel is shifting among her colleagues. The leadership of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 who has vowed to annex parts of the West Bank \u2014 has Democrats concerned that prospects for a two-state solution are disappearing. Without a two-state solution, \u201cdo we have apartheid in Israel?\u201d McCollum asked. \u201cDo we have something similar to Jim Crow laws, which we had a struggle with in this country and we\u2019re still facing the repercussions that are with race relations? Do we not say anything?\u201d The conversation is slowly shifting, but it\u2019s not hard to imagine what would have happened if Omar, the congresswoman who represents the district across the river from McCollum\u2019s, had used the word \u201capartheid\u201d in reference to Israel. Like McCollum, Omar has spoken out against the influence of AIPAC and criticized the right-wing government in Israel. But, unlike the more senior lawmaker, Omar\u2019s critics usually assume the worst interpretation of her words. In the week immediately following Omar\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins, baby\u201d tweet \u2014 an observation that members of Congress are willing to infringe on Americans\u2019 right to criticize Israel because of money directed their way by pro-Israel lobbyists \u2014 Omar was roundly accused of trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes about the influence of wealthy Jews. Her name was mentioned in 21 Fox News shows, 51 CNN shows and five MSNBC shows, The Intercept reported. Her name also appeared in nearly 500 newspaper articles, according to a Lexis Nexis search. Omar apologized after the \u201cBenjamins\u201d tweet and said she was grateful for colleagues and allies who educated her on the \u201cpainful history of anti-Semitic tropes.\u201d Later that month, she spoke at a progressive policy town hall about her fear that her legitimate criticisms of Israel will be misconstrued as anti-Semitism because she is Muslim. She asked why she is allowed to criticize the influence of the National Rifle Association and Big Pharma but not the influence of the pro-Israel lobby. But people paid attention to only one line in her remarks: \u201cI want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.\u201d Omar was talking about an effective political lobbying operation \u2014 one that includes plenty of evangelical Christians and is opposed by lots of American Jews. But Omar\u2019s critics, including some liberals, insisted she was questioning the loyalty of American Jews. New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait proclaimed she no longer deserved \u201cthe presumption of good faith,\u201d and Engel accused her of \u201cinvoking a vile anti-Semitic slur.\u201d Within days, the House passed a resolution condemning all forms of anti-Semitism, listing \u201caccusations of dual loyalty\u201d alongside the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. McCollum\u2019s staff say that the reason she doesn\u2019t evoke the same reactions as Omar is because she is careful with her words and has spent years cultivating close relationships in Congress, including with leadership and members on the other side of the political spectrum. McCollum works \u201cexcruciatingly\u201d hard to make sure that what she says about Israel is \u201cbased on evidence\u201d and is backed on reports, Harper said. She goes out of her way to make clear that she is not attacking Jews or Israelis, but the policies of a government, Harper continued. I asked more than a dozen policy advocates and Capitol Hill staffers who work on Israeli-Palestinian issues about the disparate treatment between McCollum and Omar. All of them agreed that McCollum is careful and that she benefits from close relationships with her colleagues. But racism and Islamophobia are also part of the reason why Omar faces vitriolic backlash every time she weighs in on Israel while McCollum has gone relatively unnoticed, almost all of the advocates and Capitol Hill staffers said. \u201cUndoubtedly, Rep. McCollum is one of the leading human rights champions on Palestinian human rights on the Hill, consistently for years, without fail,\u201d said Beth Miller, the government affairs manager at Jewish Voice for Peace. \u201cThe fact that she has never been attacked in the way that Reps. Tlaib and Omar have been speaks to the racism and Islamophobia that is very present in this conversation.\u201d Even if Omar used the same language that McCollum has in criticizing Israel, she would still be maligned as an anti-Semite, Munayyer argued. \u201cYou can try to be as careful as you want with your language, obviously it\u2019s important that everyone should be careful with their language on this issue,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when no matter what you say, you\u2019re being attacked because of who you are. It\u2019s not about what you\u2019re saying, it\u2019s about you having a voice on this issue.\u201d From the outside, McCollum and Omar seem like the perfect duo to bring real change to the U.S. conversation around Israel: a veteran lawmaker who has goodwill among her colleagues and a fiery newcomer who isn\u2019t afraid of raising hell. \u201cPeople like Reps. Omar and Tlaib \u2014 and, to a certain degree, Bernie Sanders \u2014 are bringing much-needed attention to the occupation in ways that we\u2019ve never seen before in Congress. But you also need workhorses like Rep. McCollum to quietly build consensus around legislation,\u201d a senior Democratic Hill staffer said. \u201cAs in any movement, the two roles are complementary. You can\u2019t make real change without both an inside and an outside strategy.\u201d Omar, who, through a spokesperson, declined an interview, is a co-sponsor of McCollum\u2019s bill \u2014 but most of the time, the two members do their own thing. \u201cIlhan is on the other side of the Mississippi River, and we talk sometimes in the break room in between votes,\u201d McCollum said, adding that the same was true with Omar\u2019s predecessors. But, at times, McCollum has seemed visibly annoyed with Omar and the controversies that surround her. In March, McCollum put out a rare statement on her Minnesota colleague: \u201cRep. Omar has the right to speak freely, and she also must take responsibility for the effect her words have on her colleagues, her constituents, and the policies Democrats seek to advance,\u201d McCollum said. \u201cDemocrats have an important agenda to advance and for any Member of Congress to be successful it takes the support of at least 217 colleagues to pass a bill. No one does this job alone.\u201d McCollum\u2019s chief of staff put it more bluntly, \u201cMy own take on it is that she really derailed a lot of our work,\u201d Harper said. But as anyone who has tried to talk, write or argue about Israel and the Palestinians knows, there\u2019s no way to do it that will please everyone. \u201cGiven how detached the D.C. debate on Israel-Palestine is from the actual reality of what goes on there, there may be no way we move this debate closer to reality in a way that avoids tension entirely,\u201d said Matt Duss, a foreign policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). \u201cWe just have to do our best to be as honest and sensitive and constructive as we can, but it\u2019s a debate we need to have.\u201d This article has been updated to include a more extensive quote from Amy Rotenberg.",

      "title": "A Lot Of Trump\u2019s Ukraine Conspiracy Theories Come From One Right-Wing Columnist", 
      "content": "Many of the allegations and fuzzy \u201cfacts\u201d that President Donald Trump and his allies have cited to defend pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden gained traction in the press thanks to one journalist: John Solomon, whose stories and columns in The Hill have made him a Fox News regular (and now a contributor). Solomon, who announced plans to leave The Hill last month, is now under fire \u2015 as he has been in the past \u2015 for deviations from normal journalistic practice. In search of a convenient narrative, Solomon has embraced questionable sources and even shared a pre-publication copy of one story with a Ukrainian American businessman who federal authorities now say was illegally trying to influence American politics. Solomon\u2019s articles are emblematic of the way the right-wing news pipeline to Trump functions: Shaky allegations get picked up by eager partisan journalists, who are then featured on Fox News where they grab the attention of the president. Last week, Solomon defended his decision to send a draft of a March 26 story on a Ukrainian anti-corruption organization to three Trump-associated operatives hours before its publication. The draft of his story \u2015 titled \u201cUS Embassy pressed Ukraine to drop probe of George Soros group during 2016 election\u201d \u2015 was shown to Lev Parnas, an Ukrainian American associate of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s who was arrested\u00a0Thursday on charges of campaign finance violation, as well as frequent Fox News guests\u00a0Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing. Solomon suggested this was part of his fact-checking process even though the story did not appear to concern those three beyond their interest in potentially damaging information about Trump\u2019s opponents. \u201cI typically spend a long period of time before any column or news story fact-checking information with numerous people,\u201d\u00a0Solomon tweeted. But Solomon\u2019s dedication to \u201cfact-checking information with numerous people\u201d didn\u2019t appear to extend to a main subject of his story, the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, which he suggested was \u201ccollaborating with FBI agents\u201d who were investigating Trump\u2019s then-campaign chair Paul Manafort. Solomon also suggested that AntAC, a Ukrainian organization, avoided an investigation because of the support of the Obama administration and billionaire George Soros, a common bogeyman for conservatives and target for conspiracy theorists. (AntAC receives funding from Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations, as well as from the U.S. government and a range of other donors.) Solomon never reached out to AntAC for comment about allegations made to him by former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko, according to AntAC\u2019s executive director, Daria Kaleniuk. (Solomon\u2019s story states that he repeatedly reached out to AntAC and Open Society Foundations, although he does not specify when.)\u00a0And unlike the Republican operatives, Kaleniuk said AntAC received no draft of the article before The Hill published it. \u201cI wonder why the same approach was not given to me, as he was naming my organization and he was actually sliming it,\u201d Kaleniuk told HuffPost. Solomon did initially contact Kaleniuk in October 2018, many months before publishing his column in The Hill, saying he was \u201cworking on a story for publication Monday about the DOJ\u2019s Kleptocracy Project and its success in Ukraine.\u201d He asked for comment on a number of questions, including about connections between AntAC, Soros\u2019 foundation and the FBI. Kaleniuk said she found the questions biased and conspiratorial and did not respond. Solomon did not publish anything to do with the Kleptocracy Project or Ukraine in the weeks after his email, according to The Hill\u2019s archives. After Solomon\u2019s story ran in March, Kaleniuk contacted The Hill\u2019s editors requesting an opportunity to comment on the allegations against her organization. But her rebuttal clearly didn\u2019t get as much traction: The Hill\u2019s website says that Solomon\u2019s original piece had over 36,000 shares, while Kaleniuk\u2019s piece had just 118. A Twitter search of accounts run by The Hill or The Hill\u2019s opinion section didn\u2019t turn up any links to Kaleniuk\u2019s piece, though the accounts did promote Solomon\u2019s work. Solomon did not respond to a voicemail message and multiple emails from HuffPost. Editors at The Hill did not respond to requests for comment. Solomon has defended his journalistic practices on Twitter. In a series of tweets\u00a0this month, he said he would sometimes send people a \u201csummary of my reporting\u201d before publication. But according to the Daily Beast, what Solomon sent to Republican operatives hours before his Ukraine story was posted online was no \u201csummary.\u201d It was a copy of his story\u00a0\u2015 headline, lede, and paragraph after paragraph. Solomon also tweeted that this was part of a fact-checking process that he had followed at every job he\u2019d held, \u201cstarting when I was a young reporter at AP and continuing today at The Hill.\u201d It is common for journalists to send a list of fact-checking questions to a subject of an article. But sharing full, unpublished drafts \u2015 especially with partisan political operatives who are not directly involved in the story \u2015 is a violation of journalistic standards that wouldn\u2019t fly at his previous publications. \u201cAP standards prohibit any behavior or activity that creates a conflict of interest, including sharing unpublished drafts of stories with sources,\u201d a spokesperson for the Associated Press told HuffPost. Solomon said that he had over \u201cthree dozen communications over three days involved in the fact checking process for that particular story.\u201d He said his fact-checking process could catch mistakes and lead to better context and comments. Solomon\u2019s reporting has been a cause of concern for newsroom staff at The Hill, who have criticized his work for bias and shared their unease at his close ties to Trump associates. Over a dozen staff members sent a memo to The Hill\u2019s management complaining about Solomon\u2019s stories and accusing him of leaving out important context that didn\u2019t fit his theories, The Washington Post reported last year. HuffPost last year debunked a misleading piece by Solomon that suggested FBI agents who\u2019d exchanged anti-Trump text messages had leaked anti-Trump material to the media. They had not. Solomon was shifted to the role of \u201copinion contributor\u201d following the staffers\u2019 memo, according to The Daily Beast, while Solomon claimed he had requested the change. Questions have also been raised about the sources Solomon has used for his columns. His March series of stories on Ukraine \u2015 a country with complex politics he had little prior history of covering \u2015 carried a wide range of claims against U.S. Democratic officials and Obama-era appointees. He suggested that Ukrainian officials, urged along by then-U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, conspired with Democrats to influence the 2016 presidential election and release damaging information against Trump. He also contended that then-Vice President Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire prosecutor general Viktor Shokin in order to quash an investigation into his son Hunter Biden, who had business ties in Ukraine. (Shokin was, in fact, widely criticized for not pushing corruption cases hard enough.) One of the main sources named in Solomon\u2019s series on Ukraine was Yuri Lutsenko, who served as prosecutor general after Shokin.\u00a0Many journalists, foreign policy experts and activists who focus on Ukraine have criticized the idea of treating Lutsenko as a reliable source, saying that he, too, is a discredited figure who has been an impediment to anti-corruption efforts. After the Trump administration recalled Ambassador Yovanovitch, Lutsenko texted AntAC\u2019s Kaleniuk to brag about how he had gotten rid of the organization\u2019s ally. Lutsenko\u00a0has also repeatedly backtracked on his various claims, including telling the Los Angeles Times in late September that he never found any evidence of wrongdoing by the Biden family. Ukrainian authorities announced on Tuesday that they have launched a criminal investigation into Lutsenko over his alleged links to illegal gambling. Lutsenko, who traveled to the United Kingdom days before the announcement, has denied any wrongdoing. Nonetheless, Solomon boosted Lutsenko\u2019s conspiracy claims against the Bidens, Yovanovitch and Clinton not only in his columns for The Hill but also on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show, which often serves as a direct pipeline to Trump. The president has tweeted about Solomon at least four times this year, usually in connection with the columnist\u2019s Fox News appearances. After Solomon was on Hannity\u2019s program in March, Trump tweeted, \u201cJohn Solomon: As Russia Collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges.\u201d He was quoting the headline of Solomon\u2019s March 20 column, which was based on an interview with Lutsenko. Appearing alongside Solomon on Fox News that evening were diGenova and Toensing, two of the political operatives to whom he emailed his draft of a later March column. Solomon was back on Fox News nine days later, suggesting to host Laura Ingraham that Democrats were attempting to hide a conspiracy between Clinton and Ukrainian officials to target Trump during the 2016 campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s what they don\u2019t want people to start digging into,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cYou\u2019re digging in it. I\u2019ve been reading your reporting on that,\u201d Ingraham responded. \u201cWe look forward to the next report.\u201d",

      "title": "Jury Hangs On Hate Crime, Civil Rights Charges Against Racist New Jersey Police Chief", 
      "content": " All 12 jurors deliberating the case against racist former New Jersey police chief Frank Nucera agree that he\u2019s a liar: They\u2019ve already convicted him of lying to the FBI. The former Bordentown Township police chief concedes he went on racist rants about nonwhite citizens that his underlings recorded. Two of his own officers testified under oath in federal court that Nucera slammed a Black teenager\u2019s head into a metal doorjamb, and Nucera didn\u2019t take the stand in his own defense. But a jury was unable to reach a verdict on two other charges \u2015 hate crime assault and deprivation of civil rights under color of law \u2015 that were directly related to the head slam his officers say he committed. U.S. District Court Judge Robert Kugler of Camden declared a mistrial on those two counts on Friday.\u00a0U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito\u00a0announced\u00a0after the mistrial that they\u2019d retry Nucera on the outstanding counts. The jury began deliberations last Wednesday, and had held discussions for over 40 hours.\u00a0The Philadelphia Inquirer\u00a0reported\u00a0that a white juror \u201cstood in the jury box with his hands crossed when the panel solemnly filed into the courtroom\u201d to deliver the verdict on the lying charge this week. The case against Nucera illustrated the challenges in holding officers accountable. Nearly two decades ago, according to The Trentonian, former Bordentown Township police officer Evan Jones says he was pushed out of the force after he filed an excessive force complaint about Nucera with the Burlington County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\u00a0Current Bordentown Township Police Chief Brian Pesce testified that he had \u201clost all trust and confidence\u201d that complaints about Nucera would be handled appropriately, and told the FBI that a former Burlington County Prosecutor told him to \u201clet sleeping dogs lie\u201d when he learned Nucera was under FBI investigation. Judge Kugler, according to the Inquirer, gave federal prosecutors until Nov. 13 to decide whether they would go to trial once again on the remaining counts. Nucera\u2019s attorney said they\u2019ll assess their options on the lying to the FBI conviction, and that Nucera \u201calways... regretted\u201d making those \u201cugly and embarrassing\u201d comments.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s held his head high throughout this process,\u201d said Rocco Cipparone. \u201cHe\u2019s handled it with grace and dignity.\u201d This has been updated with Carpenito\u2019s announcement that prosecutors will retry Nucera.",

      "content": "FORT COLLINS, Colo. \u2015 William Perry Pendley, the controversial acting director of the Bureau of Land Management, told a room full of journalists on Friday that his opinions on climate change and immigrants are \u201cirrelevant\u201d to his job overseeing 245 million acres of public land. Speaking on a panel at the Society of Environmental Journalists\u2019 annual conference, Pendley, a conservative lawyer who has spent his career fighting federal land protections and environmental regulation, sparred repeatedly with reporters. He refused to comment about his past statements that cast doubt over basic climate science and compared immigrants to a \u201ccancer.\u201d He also repeatedly responded to questions by saying, \u201cI disagree with your premise.\u201d As recently as February, Pendley compared the climate crisis to a \u201cunicorn\u201d because \u201cneither exists.\u201d Asked to clarify his position on Friday, he deferred to his boss, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who has said he hasn\u2019t lost sleep over soaring atmospheric carbon dioxide and blamed Congress for his own inaction on climate.\u00a0Bernhardt had been scheduled to appear at the conference but canceled. \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist, I\u2019m a lawyer,\u201d Pendley said. \u201cI defer to the secretary. He\u2019s been very clear on this subject. He believes that climate change is real, that mankind has an impact, that we\u2019re unable to project future climate conditions, but that we need to understand the consequences.\u201d Asked again about his own views, Pendley balked: \u201cNope, I\u2019m not going to clarify. Those are my personal opinions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a Marine. I follow orders.\u201d Pendley added that he has not been briefed on climate impacts to America\u2019s public lands in the three months he\u2019s been acting head of the\u00a0 BLM. In 2007, Pendley referred to undocumented immigrants as \u201cspreading like a cancer\u201d in a fundraising mailer for his legal fund\u00a0resurfaced by CNN this week. When pressed on Friday about the statement, Pendley brushed off the question entirely. \u201cMy personal opinions are irrelevant,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a new job now. I\u2019m a zealous advocate for my client. My client is the American people and my bosses are the president of the United States and Secretary Bernhardt. What I thought, what I wrote, what I did in the past is irrelevant. I have orders, I have laws to obey, and I intend to do that.\u201d Pendley didn\u2019t hesitate, though, to slam\u00a0Democratic presidential candidates who have pledged to stop new fossil fuel leasing on public lands for fossil fuel development if elected. \u201cSuch a policy would be absolutely devastating; it would be absolutely devastating not just to the American West, but to the entire country,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0Leaving fossil fuels in the ground, he added, would be \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d and \u201ca terrible blow to the American people.\u201d The room, as moderators requested, refrained from clapping or booing throughout the panel, which included a gas company executive, the Fort Collins mayor, an American Indian studies academic, an environmentalist and a representative of the outdoor recreation industry. But at one point, the audience in the packed auditorium at Colorado State University gasped as Pendley abruptly interrupted a Denver Post reporter as she asked a follow-up question, saying, \u201cYou want to ask a question and get an answer or do you want to keep talking?\u201d Pendley was asked about the BLM\u2019s decision in May to scrub language about land stewardship from its news releases, which now exclusively highlights the economic value of America\u2019s public lands. He initially shrugged and whispered inaudibly to Shea Loper, the U.S. government relations chief for the Canadian gas giant Encana Corp. He said he was unable to speak to the decision because it occurred before he arrived at the agency. \u201cI can\u2019t respond to your question,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d At the end of the discussion, panelists were asked what they view as the biggest threat facing public lands today. Pendley responded,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll get really in the weeds. I think the biggest issue I see is the wild horse and burro issue. We have 88,000 wild horses and burros on our Western federal lands. They are causing havoc on the lands.\u201d",

Trump, asked by reporters on the White House lawn if he had meant his comments in jest, replied: \u201cChina has to do whatever they want. If they want to look into something, they can look into it. If they don\u2019t want to look into it, they don\u2019t have to.\u201d He added: \u201cFrankly, as far as I\u2019m concerned, if China wants to look into something, I think that\u2019s great. And if they don\u2019t want to, I think that\u2019s great too. That\u2019s up to China.\u201d Trump told reporters last week that China should start an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. He made the comments amid impeachment proceedings prompted by his July 25 phone call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he requested that foreign government\u2019s aid in digging up dirt on Biden. Multiple Republican lawmakers, when asked if they believed Trump\u2019s China comments were appropriate,\u00a0defended them as being a joke, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rep.

CNN reported last week that\u00a0Trump raised the topic of Biden\u2019s political prospects during a June 18 phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to sources familiar with the call. The call record was stored on the same highly secure White House computer system used to house the summary of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. Trump\u2019s entreaties to China followed GOP questions over Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board of a Chinese private equity fund in 2013, while his father was the vice president. He accompanied his father on an official trip to China during that time.",

      "content": " WeWork informed parents on Friday that it would no longer operate its private school in Manhattan after the 2019-20 school year, HuffPost has learned. \u201cWeWork will continue to operate WeGrow through the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year, providing a quality education and classroom experience for all students,\u201d a WeWork spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAs part of the company\u2019s efforts to focus on its core business, WeWork has informed the families of WeGrow students that we will not operate WeGrow after this school year.\u201d \u201cWeWork and the families of WeGrow students are engaging in discussions with interested parties regarding plans for WeGrow for the following school year,\u201d the spokesperson added. The small New York City private school has been open since 2018 and costs between $22,000 and $42,000 a year in tuition, depending on the age of the student. Its website calls it a \u201cconscious entrepreneurial school,\u201d offering students mentorship from WeWork employees, weekly trips to a farm, daily meditation and yoga, while preaching lofty goals about nurturing students\u2019 souls. HuffPost spoke with several people close to the school in the past few weeks to get a better sense of the institution. They described a school that is run like the company of WeWork, subject to constant changes or \u201cdisruption,\u201d sometimes without full consideration for the children these changes impact. However, they also described an idealistic learning space, where children for the most part seem to be happy and thriving. According to one former employee, the company recently redesigned part of the school, which they speculated cost up to several million dollars (a spokesperson for WeWork did not respond to questions about this). The school is a casualty of the company\u2019s new efforts to downsize after the implosion of its planned public offering and a staggering reduction in its valuation. The past few weeks have been chaotic for the company, which rents out shared workspaces to businesses and entrepreneurs. Its CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann stepped down and there are rumors of mass layoffs that could impact thousands of employees. Amid the chaos, WeGrow parents wondered whether the school would even make it through the year, lining up backup options in case of an abrupt shuttering. \u201cParents and administrators are exploring all options to keep WeGrow open,\u201d said parent Jessica Ducroux on Friday morning. The school was the brainchild of WeWork co-founder and chief brand and impact officer Rebekah Neumann, who served as the school\u2019s CEO before stepping down from her roles at the company with her husband, Adam. Indeed, WeGrow mimicked WeWork, as the school\u2019s day to day was sometimes rejiggered on short notice, which could be incompatible with the needs of children, sources said. The WeWork spokesperson did not comment on this characterization of school life at WeGrow. A representative for the Neumanns did not immediately have comment. But by its second year, the school\u2019s enrollment had grown to about 100 students, including a number of children whose parents worked for the company. In 2018, Rebekah Neumann called the school \u2015 and the ability to bring company employees closer to their children \u2015 part of WeWork\u2019s core goals, according to CNN. \u201cWe want to make a world where people can work to make a life and not just a living, but that\u2019s part of a larger, more holistic mission to elevate the world\u2019s consciousness, to create a world where people are happy and fulfilled and living in a sharing state,\u201d she said. Indeed, the school employs staffers with titles like \u201ccreative expressions manager\u201d and \u201cmanager of wisdom cultures.\u201d In recent weeks, teachers have worked to shield kids from the disarray enveloping the larger company, according to a WeGrow parent. This parent praised the school for nurturing children\u2019s social-emotional development, as opposed to perpetuating a rat race focused on test scores and achievement, and worries that the school\u2019s true successes \u2015 its focus on mindfulness and community building \u2015 will be overshadowed by schadenfreude over WeWork\u2019s shortcomings. The school \u2015 like WeWork spaces \u2015 emphasizes design, and is complete with \u201cmodular classrooms, tree houses and a vertical farm,\u201d per the school\u2019s website. WeGrow is one of WeWork\u2019s auxiliary offerings. The company also rents out furnished apartments and has a gym. Rebekah Neumann appears to have had high ambitions for the institution, previously telling CNN that she hoped a WeGrow would operate in every city where there\u2019s a WeWork office. \u201cIt will eventually be able to sustain independently for sure,\u201d she said at the time.",

      "title": "Trump vs. The Constitution: In Impeachment Inquiry, Trump Insists He\u2019s Above The Law", 
      "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump has spent his time in office trying to bend the conventions of the American presidency to his will. Now he appears to be trying to override a core principle of democracy: that no one is above the law. Faced with an impeachment inquiry, Trump has openly defied the core constructs of the Constitution. He chafes at the idea of co-equal branches of government and rejects the House\u2019s right to investigate him. He has deployed a convoluted logic in which he has declared that the courts can\u2019t investigate him because as president he cannot be charged with a crime but also that Congress cannot impeach him because its inquiry is politically illegitimate. It\u2019s a \u201cheads he wins, tails you lose\u201d formulation. \u201cIt\u2019s anathema to his character and his life story to be checked and balanced by anything,\u201d said presidential historian Jon Meacham, a professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThe Constitution was formed to contain appetite. And we now have the president who is driven entirely by appetite.\u201d In a scathing eight-page letter this week, the Republican president\u2019s lawyers served notice there will be no cooperation with the impeachment inquiry. Trump\u2019s White House has ignored document requests and subpoenas. It readily invokes executive privilege \u2014 going so far as to argue that the privilege extends to informal presidential advisers who never held White House jobs. And his team all but dares Democrats to hold them in contempt. The impeachment standoff follows a pattern Trump has established throughout his presidency as he has jettisoned experienced advisers and flouted conventions. The fact that he survived the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation without paying much of a political penalty left him all the more emboldened. One day after Robert Mueller\u2019s faltering testimony brought an end to that threat, Trump unleashed a new one by asking Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political foe Joe Biden. That prompted the fast-moving impeachment inquiry that Trump now resists. After two weeks of a listless and unfocused response to the impeachment probe, the White House letter to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week was a declaration of war. While it was filled with dubious legal arguments, its intent was clear: Trump would not play ball, claiming that the game was rigged against him. As for all the subpoenas flying from House Democrats, an exasperated Trump said Thursday, \u201cYou\u2019re running a country, I just don\u2019t think that you can have all of these people testifying about every conversation you\u2019ve had.\u201d And as for the Democrats, Trump claimed Wednesday they\u2019re the ones playing dirty \u201cbecause they have a tiny margin in the House.\u201d \u201cThey have eviscerated the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t give us any \u2014 any fair play. It\u2019s the most unfair situation people have seen.\u201d The Constitution gives the House \u201cthe sole power of impeachment.\u201d But it confers that authority without providing any guidelines, which the White House has seized upon in demanding that Pelosi call for a vote to authorize the inquiry as happened in the last two impeachment inquiries. No vote is required, and Trump\u2019s strategy risks further provoking Democrats in the impeachment probe, setting up court challenges and the potential for lawmakers to draw up an article of impeachment for obstructing their investigations. \u201cThe president does not have all-consuming power,\u201d said Nick Ackerman, a member of the Watergate prosecution team that investigated President Richard Nixon. \u201cWe play by certain rules, and we expect the rule of law to apply. We don\u2019t have checks and balances if he ignores them. That itself is an impeachable defense, which is what Nixon faced.\u201d It is unclear whether Democrats would wade into a lengthy legal fight with the administration over documents and testimony or if they would just move straight to considering articles of impeachment. Trump, for his part, has never been one to rely on legality or logic in making his arguments. In the last week alone, he called for the impeachment of Sen. Mitt Romney and Rep. Adam Schiff \u2014 events that can\u2019t occur \u2014 and in part justified his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, leaving the Kurds vulnerable to Turkish attacks, by saying the Kurds did not assist at Normandy during World War II. Since taking office, he has taken repeatedly taken unilateral action to defy Congress and push the limits of his own power, declaring a national emergency so he could divert funds for a border wall and taking executive action to try to halt immigration from several Muslim-majority nations. Trump on Thursday punctuated a tweet about unfair media coverage with four words that seemed to sum up his entire viewpoint of the American system: \u201cOh well, I\u2019m President!\u201d The Constitution was built to withstand tests like this. \u201cBoth the strength of the American system and one of its most frustrating aspects is that it\u2019s incredibly difficult to do anything quickly, particularly bad things, which the founders believed would happen more often than good things,\u201d Meacham said. \u201cChecks and balances were created so one bad actor could not dominate the proceedings. We now have that bad actor.\u201d ___ EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 Jonathan Lemire has covered politics and the White House for The Associated Press since 2013. ___ Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire",

The Council on American-Islamic Relations\u00a0and its Minnesota chapter slammed Trump\u2019s speech in Minneapolis in which he singled out the state\u2019s Somali-born Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar as an \u201cAmerica-hating socialist\u201d before broadening his attacks to the local Somali refugee population as a whole. \u201cLast night\u2019s racist rant targeting Somali-Americans is just the latest example of Donald Trump\u2019s use of white supremacist and anti-immigrant rhetoric to advance his twisted political agenda by dividing our nation along racial, ethnic and religious lines,\u201d Nihad Awad, CAIR\u2019s national executive director, said in a statement\u00a0Friday. \u201cIt is all the more disturbing that the almost all-white audience welcomed this overt racism and that Republican political leaders remain silent or even support such bigotry.\u201d During his speech at Minneapolis\u2019 Target Center, Trump prompted boos from the audience when he said the state\u2019s Somali refugees had been welcomed by Washington politicians \u201cwithout considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers.\u201d Continuing, he boasted of his plan to slash refugee resettlement by nearly 85% from 2016 levels, declaring that \u201cin the Trump administration, we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are keeping terrorists, criminals and extremists the hell out of our country.\u201d Rebuking Trump\u2019s scare tactics, Awad warned of their consequences. \u201cTrump\u2019s vile views and policies are having a corrosive effect on the ties that bind our nation together, and if left unchecked by those who value American traditions of inclusion and mutual respect, will do untold damage to our democracy,\u201d he said. Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR\u2019s Minnesota branch, also called out the president\u2019s \u201chate rhetoric,\u201d raising concerns that it \u201cplaces the entire Somali community in Minnesota and nationwide in danger from the growing white supremacist movement that looks to him for validation and encouragement.\u201d Awad and Hussein\u2019s remarks added to criticism from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who also represents Minnesota. \u201cImmigrants and refugees have helped make our state a wonderful place to live and work \u2014 which is far more than this President has done,\u201d she tweeted Thursday. \u201cStop using immigrants and refugees as political pawns!\u201d Another 2020 hopeful, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) echoed Klobuchar\u2019s remarks, tweeting that next week, Trump will bring \u201cthis same message of hate\u201d at his Dallas rally next week, though O\u2019Rourke plans to hold a counter-rally titled \u201cRally Against Fear\ufeff\u201d to \u201cshow he doesn\u2019t represent our country.\u201d",

      "title": "Appeals Court Rules House Democrats Can Subpoena Trump\u2019s Financial Records", 
      "content": " The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday upheld a subpoena that House Democrats sent to President Donald Trump\u2019s accounting firm for his financial records and tax returns. The court issued a 2-1 ruling\ufeff\u00a0that the House Oversight & Reform Committee has the constitutional authority to investigate wrongdoing by the president of the United States and can therefore subpoena his financial records in pursuit of that investigation. The subpoena was initially filed by the committee to Mazars LLP, the president\u2019s accounting firm, as part of its pursuit to evaluate and update existing ethics legislation. It came after former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen told the committee that the president routinely manipulated his finances to obtain loans and evade taxes. Lawyers for the committee argued that the pursuit of these documents was part of its legislative function as it evaluated new executive branch financial disclosure and conflict of interest laws. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers intervened to argue that the House did not have a legitimate legislative purpose in pursuing the documents from the accounting firm and that the only valid way to subpoena any document connected to the president was through an impeachment. The two judges who voted to uphold the subpoena \u2015 David Tatel, appointed by President Bill Clinton, and Patricia Millett, appointed by President Barack Obama \u2015 ruled that the committee was acting under its legislative function in pursuit of potential legislation. They also ruled that the committee issued its subpoena under valid authority granted by House Rules and the Constitution. In doing so, Tatel and Millett upheld multiple precedents enabling congressional investigations into the executive branch that could uncover law-breaking and other wrongdoing. The judges knocked down arguments made by Trump\u2019s lawyers that the public statements of committee members showed the committee was not pursuing a legitimate legislative purpose, but rather an unconstitutional law-enforcement action targeting the president. \u201cFollowing that course, we conclude that the public record reveals legitimate legislative pursuits, not an impermissible law-enforcement purpose, behind the Committee\u2019s subpoena,\u201d Tatel and Millett wrote. \u201cAs a result, we need not decide precisely what deference we owe Congress, as we would reach the same conclusion absent any deference at all.\u201d They also found that the committee was pursuing legislation that could be enacted. Trump\u2019s lawyers tried to argue that the legislation would be found unconstitutional and therefore was not legitimate. \u201c[W]e detect no inherent constitutional flaw in laws requiring Presidents to publicly disclose certain financial information. And that is enough,\u201d the majority opinion reads. Their ultimate conclusion: \u201cAt bottom, this subpoena is a valid exercise of the legislative oversight authority because it seeks information important to determining the fitness of legislation to address potential problems within the Executive Branch and the electoral system; it does not seek to determine the President\u2019s fitness for office.\u201d Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, issued a dissent that broke with long-standing Supreme Court precedent by arguing that Congress has no right to investigate the president except under its impeachment authority. \u201c[A]llegations of illegal conduct against the President cannot be investigated by Congress except through impeachment,\u201d Rao wrote in her dissent. Such a determination would overturn a 1962 Supreme Court precedent that \u201ca congressional committee which is engaged in a legitimate legislative investigation need not grind to a halt whenever...crime or wrongdoing is disclosed.\u201d \u201cThe dissent would reorder the very structure of the Constitution,\u201d Tatel and Millett argue in their majority opinion. \u201cThroughout history, the Constitution has left to Congress the judgment whether to commence the impeachment process. But the dissent\u2019s approach would not even allow Congress to make the quintessentially legislative judgment that some concerns about potential misconduct or illegality are better addressed through oversight and legislation than impeachment.\u201d If Rao\u2019s opinion overturned past precedent, Congress would be left with no recourse to investigate impeachable executive branch officials for wrongdoing unless it immediately opens an impeachment inquiry. This would gut congressional investigatory powers and tilt the balance of power between the branches of government even further to the benefit of the executive branch. House Democrats previously leaned on this case as an argument against pursuing impeachment earlier in 2019. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) argued that Democrats needed to pursue the president\u2019s documents through the courts as part of the ordinary course of business. A whistleblower\u2019s disclosure that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election, however, changed that equation. The House is now engaged in an impeachment inquiry. This decision is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court, to which Trump has appointed two justices: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an ally of Trump\u2019s, was asked in 2018 whether the courts would allow House Democrats to obtain the president\u2019s tax returns. \u201cThen they\u2019ll be trapped into appealing to the Supreme Court, and we\u2019ll see whether or not the Kavanaugh fight was worth it,\u201d\u00a0Gingrich replied.",

The veteran foreign service officer, who reportedly delivered those remarks in a closed-door deposition, said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201cincredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an Ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d Yovanovitch was abruptly removed from her Ukraine post on May 6 after what appeared to be a monthslong campaign by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and others close to the president who complained she was undermining the administration\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. She told investigators on Friday that John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, had informed her of \u201ca concerted campaign\u201d against her and said Trump had been pushing for her removal since the summer of 2018. Sullivan \u201calso said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause,\u201d she said. Yovanovitch also said she\u2019d had \u201conly minimal contacts\u201d with Giuliani. \u201cI do not know Mr. Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me,\u201d Yovanovitch said. \u201cBut individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster has become a flashpoint in the House\u2019s impeachment investigation into whether Trump abused his power to \u201cadvance his personal interests,\u201d as a\u00a0recent whistleblower complaint said.\u00a0Congressional investigators are now looking into the administration\u2019s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine for damaging information about Biden, based on unsubstantiated allegations that he used his power as vice president during the Obama administration to kill an investigation into a gas company on whose board his son served. (In fact, Biden and others pushed the Ukrainian government to remove a top prosecutor for not pursuing corruption cases aggressively enough.) Yovanovitch was the subject of an attempted smear campaign earlier this year by Trump allies who sent a packet of documents with misinformation about her to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Conservative media outlets and the president\u2019s eldest son,\u00a0Donald Trump Jr., have also\u00a0accused\u00a0her of being part of an alleged Ukrainian attempt to support\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign \u2015 a claim she vehemently denied on Friday. During their\u00a0July 25 phone call, President Trump ominously told Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky that Yovanovitch was \u201cgoing to go through some things\u201d in the aftermath of her removal from the ambassador\u2019s post. In a joint statement on Friday, Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said their panels learned Thursday evening that the White House had directed the State Department to tell Yovanovitch not to appear before House investigators. \u201cThis is the latest example of the Administration\u2019s efforts to conceal the facts from the American people and obstruct our lawful and constitutionally-authorized impeachment inquiry,\u201d said the three chairmen of committees conducting the impeachment inquiry. The Intelligence Committee subsequently issued a subpoena, they said, with which Yovanovitch complied. \u201cAny efforts by Trump Administration officials to prevent witness cooperation with the Committees will be deemed obstruction of a co-equal branch of government and an adverse inference may be drawn against the President on the underlying allegations of corruption and coverup,\u201d the chairmen said. Yovanovitch on Friday warned that her ouster and other recent events could signal larger problems at the State Department and for American diplomacy generally. \u201cToday, we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to rebuild diplomacy as the first resort to advance America\u2019s interests and the front line of America\u2019s defense,\u201d Yovanovitch continued. \u201cI fear that not doing so will harm our nation\u2019s interest, perhaps irreparably.\u201d Read her prepared remarks below:",

      "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told lawmakers Friday that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to oust her from her position. Yovanovitch said in an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press that she was \u201cabruptly\u201d recalled in May and told the president had lost confidence in her. She said she was told by an official that there was a \u201cconcerted campaign against me\u201d and that Trump had pressured officials to remove her for almost a year. \u201cAlthough I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,\u201d Yovanovitch wrote in the statement. Yovanovitch appeared on Capitol Hill Friday for a deposition in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, accepting lawmakers\u2019 invitation to testify despite Trump\u2019s declaration that no one in his administration would cooperate with the probe. The Democrats are investigating Trump\u2019s dealings with the Ukrainian president. Yovanovitch is now a State Department fellow at Georgetown University. Trump said earlier this week that he would block all officials from testifying, saying the probe was unfair and \u201cillegitimate.\u201d It was unclear if Yovanovitch\u2019s appearance signaled a shift in that strategy or if she was breaking with White House orders. Democrats are investigating Trump\u2019s pleas to Ukrainian officials to launch investigations of political rival Joe Biden and his family and to probe Ukraine\u2019s involvement in the 2016 presidential election. Yovanovitch was recalled from Kyiv as Rudy Giuliani \u2014 who is Trump\u2019s personal attorney and has no official role in the U.S. government \u2014 pushed Ukrainian officials to investigate baseless corruption allegations against the Bidens. Yovanovitch was removed from her post after insisting that Giuliani\u2019s requests to Ukrainian officials for investigations be relayed through official channels, according to a former diplomat who has spoken with her. In a July 25 phone call, Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Yovanovitch was \u201cbad news,\u201d according to a partial transcript released by the White House. Neither Giuliani nor Trump has publicly specified their objections to Yovanovitch. Businessmen with ties to Giuliani lobbied a U.S. congressman in 2018 for help ousting Yovanovitch, according to an indictment made public Thursday following the men\u2019s arrest. It alleges that the men leveraged a flurry of GOP political donations to force Yovanovitch\u2019s removal, an effort prosecutors say was aided by laundered foreign money. The former diplomat who spoke with Yovanovitch said the ambassador refused to do \u201call this offline, personal, informal stuff\u201d and made clear that the U.S. government had formal ways to request foreign governments\u2019 help with investigations. The former diplomat insisted on anonymity to disclose the private conversation. The State Department traditionally relies on mutual legal assistance treaties, under which U.S. and foreign officials agree to exchange evidence and information in criminal investigations. Yovanovitch was speaking to the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees behind closed doors Friday. The committees are scheduled to talk to several other U.S. diplomats next week, as well. On Monday, Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser who focused on Russia, is expected to testify. Three current State Department officials also are tentatively scheduled next week \u2014 Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, and Ulrich Brechbuhl, a State Department counselor. Sondland was originally scheduled for a deposition this past Tuesday but did not show up. Trump tweeted immediately afterward that he couldn\u2019t let Sondland testify because the Democratic-led probe was \u201ccompromised.\u201d The committees subpoenaed Sondland hours later for a deposition next week, and his attorneys said Friday he would testify on Oct. 17, despite the administration\u2019s position. \u201cNotwithstanding the State Department\u2019s current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees\u2019 subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday,\u201d said a statement from attorneys Robert Luskin and Kwame Manley. \u201cAmbassador Sondland has at all times acted with integrity and in the interests of the United States. He has no agenda apart from answering the Committees\u2019 questions fully and truthfully.\u201d The statement said, however, that Sondland would not be able to product documents \u201cconcerning his official responsibilities,\u201d as they were controlled by the State Department. Democrats want to ask him about text messages released last week that show him and two other U.S. diplomats acting as intermediaries as Trump urged Ukraine to investigate Ukraine\u2019s involvement in the 2016 U.S. election and Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement with a gas company there. Earlier this week, the White House sent Congress a letter outlining its opposition to the impeachment probe and refusing to cooperate with requests for information, including interviews with administration officials. The House committees have moved to subpoena officials instead. On Thursday, 10 Democratic senators sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo demanding an explanation for Yovanovitch\u2019s removal before the end of her three-year assignment. \u201cIn particular, her early recall raises questions about whether you put the personal interests of the President above the Department\u2019s career personnel or U.S. foreign policy,\u201d they wrote. Even before the testimony, the attention on Yovanovitch was renewed Thursday after U.S. prosecutors arrested two Florida businessmen tied to Giuliani, charging them with campaign finance violations. An indictment filed in the case alleged that the men, who were raising campaign funds for a U.S. congressman, asked him for help in removing Yovanovitch, at least partly at the request of Ukrainian government officials. Yovanovitch has led U.S. embassies in Kyrgyzstan and Armenia and is now a State Department fellow at Georgetown University. The director of the Georgetown program, Barbara Bodine, said the former envoy is declining all requests for interviews. Former colleagues of Yovanovitch said Trump allies\u2019 characterizations of her as politically motivated are off-base. She is \u201ca top-notch diplomat, careful, meticulous, whip smart,\u201d and unlikely to have badmouthed Trump, either to Ukrainian officials or her colleagues, said John Herbst, a predecessor as ambassador in Ukraine who worked alongside Yovanovitch there in the early 2000s. Yovanovitch has always known that the role of diplomat \u201cwasn\u2019t about her\u201d but about \u201cserving American national interests and supporting the people around her,\u201d said Nancy McEldowney, a former U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria who now directs a Foreign Service program at Georgetown. ___ Associated Press Writers Matthew Lee and Jocelyn Noveck contributed to this report.",
