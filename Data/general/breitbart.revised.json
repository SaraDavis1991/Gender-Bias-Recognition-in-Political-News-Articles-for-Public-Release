      "subtitle": "The United States Supreme Court on Tuesday heard oral arguments on two cases that ask the court to expand the sex discrimination protections in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to cover homosexuals and transgenders.",
      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": " \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, there are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gorsuch said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the question, Mr. Cole.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Cole, the question is a matter of the judicial role and the modesty in interpreting statutes that are old. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the question he posed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gorsuch said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody is questioning, and he certainly did not, the legitimacy of the claims and the importance of them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gorsuch said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe question is about judicial interpretation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gorsuch said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you wish to address it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cole said that the Plaintiff was not asking to change the definition of sex as it was defined in 1964 but argued that it was because of his sex as a man who wanted \u00e2\u0080\u009cto present\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a woman that caused the termination. Gorsuch responded that the case could be close on the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctextual\u00e2\u0080\u009d review of the 1964 law but that social implications are much broader. He said: At the end of the day, should he or she take into consideration the massive social upheaval that would be entailed in such a decision, and the possibility that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Congress didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about it. That is more effective \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more appropriate a legislative rather than a judicial function? But Cole argued transgenders are not \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisruptive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, first of all, federal courts of appeals have been recognizing that discrimination against transgender people is sex discrimination for 20 years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cole said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been no upheaval.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I was saying, there are transgender male lawyers in this courtroom following the male dress code and going to the men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room and the Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dress code and sex-segregated restrooms have not fallen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cole added. Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia and Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarada were brought by homosexual men who claimed they were fired because of their sexual orientation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo the notion that somehow this is going to be a huge upheaval, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen that upheaval for 20 years, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no reason you \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you would see that upheaval,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cole said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTransgender people follow the rule that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s associated with their gender identity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not disruptive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cole said. In previewing the cases, Steven D. Schwinn, professor of law at the University of Illinois Chicago John Marshall Law School, said that the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruling \u00e2\u0080\u009cmatters deeply to the estimated 11.3 million LGBTQ adults in the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But \u00e2\u0080\u009cemployers, the government and their amici argue that the plaintiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reading of Title VII would so \u00e2\u0080\u0098expand\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the concept of \u00e2\u0080\u009csex\u00e2\u0080\u009d that employers would not know show to comply, and courts would not know how to enforce it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schwinn wrote: Moreover, the defendants and their amici argue that the plaintiffs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reading of Title VII could mean the end of things like sex-specific restrooms and locker rooms and this could actually undermine Title VII by threatening other sex specific practices and institutions that are designed to provide an equal playing field between men and women. These cases are Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia, No. 17-1618, Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, No. 17-1623, and R.G. &G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC, No. 18-107 in the Supreme Court of the United States. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC centers on a man who was fired after he announced he had changed his name and would now be coming to work as a woman. The business\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sex-specific dress code required women to wear skirts as their work uniform. Justice Neil Gorsuch had an exchange with David Cole, attorney for Aimee Stephens, who was William Stephens for the six years he worked at the funeral home, first as an apprentice and then as a funeral director and embalmer. Cole said that Stephens would have been fired even if he complied with the dress code for women in the funeral home because he was a man, a clear case of sex discrimination, he argued. Gorsuch said: I guess I \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just like you to have a chance to respond to Judge Lynch in his thoughtful dissent in which he lamented everything you have before us, but suggested that something as drastic a change in this country as bathrooms in every place of employment and dress codes in every place of employment that are otherwise gender neutral would be changed, that that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an essentially legislative decision. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJudge Lynch is a very thoughtful judge and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and wrote a very thoughtful opinion that I \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I think he probably regretted having to write,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gorsuch said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you say to him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cole said: I say that recognizing that transgender people have a right to exist in the workplace and not be turned away because of who they are does not end dress codes or restrooms. There are transgender lawyers in this courtroom today.",

Max Rose has got to go!\u00e2\u0080\u0093 swarmed his office on Monday alongside\u00c2\u00a0Staten Island GOP Chairman Brendan Lantry and New York State Republican Chairman Nick Langworthy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president won this district by almost 11 percentage points, the people of Staten Island and Brooklyn and this district spoke loud and clear, (Rose) is going to face a wrath of those constituents next November, mark my words,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Langworthy said at the protest, according to MSN. Lantry added: Instead of focusing on doing his job and focusing on the important issues like improving our infrastructure, making New York competitive despite oppressive taxes and regulations, or lowering the cost of prescription drugs, Max fell in line with the most radical elements of the Democratic Party. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insulting the left is questioning our decision of whom we voted for,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one voter said:  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMax Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constituents overwhelmingly voted to elect President Trump, but Max just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let it go: he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absolutely obsessed with impeaching Trump and overturning his constituents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 choice in the 2016 election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) spokesman Calvin Moore said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMax Rose has no intention of delivering on any of the issues voters elected him on, as long as he can team up with radical left for one more Hail Mary pass at removing Trump from office, no matter the cost,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Rose defended his decision to back the inquiry on Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fight our enemies overseas so that our leaders would invite them to interfere in our elections back home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disappointing to see the Republican Party put China and Russia ahead of America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy job is to get the facts, not play politics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rose is not the only lawmaker who has faced protests over support for the impeachment inquiry.

USA Today reported that Brown was found \u00e2\u0080\u009cshot to death\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a parking lot Friday, and NBC News reports that a suspect in Brown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death was arrested today.

      "subtitle": "The Trump campaign claimed victory late Tuesday in its battle with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a first term Democrat elected in 2017 who wanted the campaign to pay more than $500,000 in security expenses for Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally at the Target Center.",
      "author": "Michael Patrick Leahy",
      "content": " \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe arena in Minneapolis has been fully approved. The Target Center has backed off cancelling the contract, which means President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Keep America Great rally will go on as scheduled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cConsistent with our original agreement with the venue, the Trump campaign has not agreed to pay any additional funds. We look forward to seeing everyone Thursday night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parscale concluded. The Trump campaign criticized Frey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action in a statement released on Monday evening: The radical leftist mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, is abusing the power of his office and attempting to extort President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election campaign by conjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security in an effort to block a scheduled Keep America Great rally. Democrat Mayor Frey is using the bogus security charges to pressure the Target Center, site of the contracted October 10, 2019 rally, into preventing Minnesota residents from exercising their First Amendment rights in support of President Trump. Frey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s city government preemptively informed the Target Center that it would be responsible for $530,000 in security and other costs related to the event. The Target Center attempted to pass the costs on to the Trump campaign under threat of withholding the use of the arena. The Trump campaign informed the Target Center that the U.S. Secret Service is solely responsible for coordinating security and that withholding the use of the arena would be viewed as a breach of contract and result in court action. Additionally, the ridiculous sum of $530,000 is more than 26 times the estimated security costs for a 2009 Target Center health care rally held by President Barack Obama. Police officials estimated that the costs then were around $20,000. Again, the costs are a matter between the city and the Secret Service. On Tuesday morning, President Trump blasted Frey in a tweet:   The battle lines between critics and supporters of the president have been drawn in Minnesota \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a critical 2020 battleground state that President Trump lost by a narrow margin of about 44,000 votes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 since his election in November 2016. The Trump rally in the Target Center on Thursday is expected to accelerate that battle, as\u00c2\u00a0WCCO reported: On Monday afternoon, a small coalition of protesters turned out to say their numbers will be much larger on Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe invite all Minnesotans to join us to oppose Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s racist agenda, his anti-people agenda,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tracy Molm, of the Anti-War Committee, said. Earlier Monday outside Target Center, a small group chanted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo Trump, no KKK, no racist USA,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ahead of holding a press conference regarding planned protests Thursday. The coalition said they plan to protest peacefully, but they believe Trump will target U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar during his rally. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re worried that militia and anti-Muslim groups will follow the president to Minneapolis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe believe this will be the case this week as this president comes to continue to further pin neighbors against one another,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR, said. Supporters of the president, including\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cmembers of the Minneapolis Police Federation\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a number of grassroots conservative groups, are expected to turn out in large numbers outside as well as inside the Target Center rally.",

      "subtitle": "Inside the United States Supreme Court on Tuesday, justices heard oral arguments on whether Section VII the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protecting individuals from discrimination because of their sex applies to homosexuals and transgenders.",
      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": " But as attorneys made their pitches in the courtroom, Walt Heyer was making his own case about the lies being told about gender dysphoria on the steps of the High Court. Heyer has credibility on the subject: In his 40s he started taking hormones, had gender reassignment surgery and lived as Laura Jensen for eight years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt all started when I was four-years-old and my grandmother started crossdressing me and I enjoyed it very much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jensen said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut that cross dressing started a confusion within me about who I was.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it was in 1944 before we had any words like gender dysphoria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heyer said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was just a confused kid that was being affirmed by my grandmother who actually caused me to have this tremendous confusion, which started this journey to transgenderism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heyer said. Heyer said it was when he starting studying to be a counselor that he uncovered the truth about his own life. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to be a therapist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heyer said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I studied at U.C. Santa Cruz and realized in studying the books in the stacks that people who identified with gender identity disorder had mental disorders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I thought we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not approaching this from the right direction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heyer said on the steps of the Supreme Court. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to be addressing the co-morbid problems that are causing people to believe they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a different gender.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems to be compassionate to me to reach out to those people and actually guide them in the right direction and not fill their bodies with hormones and cut body parts off and rearrange everything in their lives so their lives are totally destroyed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heyer said. Heyer, who has lived as a married man for the past 21 years, has a website, sexchangeregret.com\u00c2\u00a0that he said hundreds of thousands of people have visited. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday we have a worldwide ministry that reaches over 300 million people a year and people now are de-transitioning in the hundreds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heyer said. Heyer also wrote about his life in USA Today earlier this year: I was 50 when I had the breast implants removed, but the next few years were spent in confusion and counseling. In 1996, at the age of 55, I was finally free from the desire to live as a woman and changed my legal documents back to Walt, my biologically correct male sex. I still have scars on my chest, reminders of the gender detour that cost me 13 years of my life. I am on a hormone regimen to try to regulate a system that is permanently altered. Had I not been misled by media stories of sex change \u00e2\u0080\u009csuccess\u00e2\u0080\u009d and by medical practitioners who said transitioning\u00c2\u00a0was the answer to my problems, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have suffered as I have. Genetics can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be changed. Feelings, however, can and do change. Underlying issues often drive the desire to escape one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life into another, and they need to be addressed before taking the radical step of transition. After de-transitioning, I know the truth: Hormones and surgery may alter appearances, but nothing changes the immutable fact of your sex. Heyer told people gathered at the Supreme Court \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many there to protest for homosexual and transgender rights \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that he has compassion for people who are struggling with their gender dysphoria but that true compassion calls for telling them the truth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have tremendous compassion for those people who are struggling deeply with their identity and we all need to love them and have compassion for them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heyer said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut compassion isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t filling them with hormones; cutting off body parts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s addressing the issues that are causing them to feel that way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heyer said.

      "subtitle": "We have impeachment witnesses testifying in secret. We have transcripts of that testimony kept secret. We have Democrats refusing to allow Republicans to question a secret (fake) whistleblower. We have selective leaks of this secret testimony. We have the ringleader behind all of this, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), secretly conspiring with the fake whistleblower. And all of this is occurring within the framework of overturning a presidential election.",
      "author": "",
      "content": "We all know why Democrats and the media want the whistleblower to be allowed to hurl rocks and tomatoes from behind a mask\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This removes the right of the accused to question the motives and integrity of his accuser. Imagine if we had never met Julie Swetnick and Christine Blasey Ford, the two liars who accused then-Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Without the opportunity to question them and learn about their histories, the phony charges they leveled probably would have brought Kavanaugh down. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what Democrats want to avoid, and no one can blame them. Politics is tough stuff. I get that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But what we are seeing from the media is a total abdication of every journalistic standard as they defend the secret proceedings behind a presidential coup orchestrated by a man who has made a cottage industry out of lying to the media about having the goods on Trump. Can you imagine Chuck Todd and Jake Tapper, or anyone else who pretends to be a journalist, if some anonymous whistleblower downloaded on Barack Obama and Republicans responded with secret hearings where Democrats were not even allowed to question the accuser? Can you imagine Republicans holding secret impeachment proceedings to take down Obama using secret testimony? The media would literally be on television jumping up and down on their desks demanding transparency. And they would be 100 percent right. But we no longer have a media. All we have is a mob of coup plotters frustrated as hell over the failure of the Russia Collusion Hoax, backed by billions of corporate dollars, and who are willing to do everything in their sinister power to facilitate the removal of a duly elected president in almost total secrecy, willing to be serially lied to by an Adam Schiff, willing to violate every norm that makes our Constitution, our judicial and political system the envy of the world \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 just to get Drumpf. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.  There is no way a legitimate media would ever be okay with any of this. Throughout this entire Ukraine Hoax, Schiff has lied to the media, misled the media with selective leaks, over-promised on supposed bombshells \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like what we would learn from the Ukraine call transcript that ended up being a big dud \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Schiff is right now working in the kind of partisan secrecy that literally reeks of a banana republic. And still\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Our corrupt media do not care. In fact, they are aiding and abetting this fascist secrecy. A legitimate media would be screaming from the rafters for all witness transcripts to be released, not just to them but to the public. A legitimate media that truly believed in \u00e2\u0080\u009cnorms\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d would demand that witnesses testify in public, would demand that the name of the phony whistleblower be released, would demand that a \u00c2\u00a0process as serious as impeachment be every bit as transparent and public as previous impeachment efforts in the television age \u00e2\u0080\u0094 meaning the impeachment will be televised. How did our media become so corrupt and so un-American that they are facilitating this secret coup attempt, not only with their silence in the face of this unprecedented secrecy, but with propaganda-nonsense about how dangerous it would be for the whistleblower to be identified.",

      "subtitle": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) sent a fundraising email Tuesday evening in which she repeated a claim that she had been fired from her first teaching job for being \u00e2\u0080\u009cvisibly pregnant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " However, new evidence that has emerged in the past several days \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from left-wing, right-wing, and mainstream media sources \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has cast doubt on that claim. In the subject line of her email, Warren claimed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy June I was visibly pregnant \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the principal told me the job I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d already been promised for the next year would go to someone else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy story is not unique. And now, right-wing media outlets are dismissing my story \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and in doing so, dismissing many similar stories of other women who have also been affected by pregnancy discrimination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The implication was that the principal fired her\u00c2\u00a0because of her pregnancy. Warren has repeated the same story on the campaign trail and the debate stage for several months. However, in a video interview from 2007 highlighted by Jacobin writer (and Democratic Socialists of America member) Meagan Day last Tuesday, Warren said that she chose to leave her job after her first year because she lacked the necessary qualifications and decided, while pursuing the necessary graduate level education courses, that she did not want to continue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI actually didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the education courses, so I was on an \u00e2\u0080\u0099emergency certificate,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 it was called,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren recalled. \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I went back to graduate school, and took a couple of courses in education, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this is going to work out for me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d She then added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby, and I stayed home for a couple of years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren never mentioned anything about being fired. On Monday, the Washington Free Beacon published notes from county school board meetings showing that Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contract had been renewed unanimously for a second year, but that she chose to resign \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a decision the board accepted \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith regret.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Late Monday evening, CBS News published a story in which Warren stuck to her story about being let go for being pregnant, saying she had only opened up more fully about her life when entering politics. The mainstream news network also found contemporaneous newspaper accounts from 1971 that reported Warren had left her job voluntarily. In her fundraising email, Warren cited one of two teachers quoted in the CBS News story, who said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer. But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She left out that the teachers also told CBS News that they \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember anyone being explicitly fired due to pregnancy during their time at the school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren, who raised nearly $25 million in the third quarter, trailing only Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) among Democratic presidential candidates, has used this fundraising tactic before. In November 2017, she raised\u00c2\u00a0cash off President Donald Trump calling her \u00e2\u0080\u009cPocahontas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d referring to her false claims of Native American ancestry. By 2019, she had to apologize. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": " \u00e2\u0080\u009cA man can never be a woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Natasha Chart told the crowd and the cameras. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lesbian can never be male \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I will not be forced to lie, I will not submit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. She spoke from a stage where her broad alliance of feminists, lesbians, and conservatives explained their shared political opposition to the transgender ideology. Their anti-transgenderism speeches were delivered as several lawyers for the transgender movement told the Supreme Court judges that the government must embrace transgenderism. That ideology demands that the government outlaw any legal or civic recognition of the complementary sexual and biological differences between legally equal men and women. Chart, a feminist writer at FeministCurrent.org, used her speech to urge other feminists to walk away from the men who dominate the transgender ideology: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been told that I am not a nice, inclusive person for saying that the law needs to be able to recognize sex. And not just me, but all the women who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that human beings can change sex. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve even been accused of perpetrating genocide. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny because five years ago, I first started seeing lesbians were being publicly shamed, sexually harassed, and demonized by straight men calling themselves lesbians. These men also tended to call themselves progressives, feminists \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They keep telling us now that they are absolutely indispensable to the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement, and we cannot do without them. Everyone can always see this behavior, and they always get away with it. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that sexually harassing lesbians is a good way to be inclusive. So I objected. It turns out it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a firing offense on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left to complain about men sexually harassing lesbians if that man says he feels like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lesbian. That harassment still goes on, and if anything, it has gotten worse. Women share shocking screenshots with me from lesbian dating apps, which are now just simply packed wall-to-wall with men. These men have even started getting women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s [social media] profiles suspended for saying no to them and refusing to recognize their gender and validate their feelings. Across social media, women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accounts and access to public conversation is under permanent, constant surveillance for offenses against men claiming to be women, with catastrophic penalties for refusing to lie for them to spare their feelings. Is that nice behavior? What about my feelings? What about the feelings of all the women who have lost all access to public conversation on social media? I saw that President [Barack] Obama made several moves to end single-sex facilities for women and girls through executive branch orders and funding threats. His administration and now the entire Democratic congressional caucus made a point of insisting on an end to women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights to bodily privacy from men whenever we are outside our homes. If a woman complains that a man has dropped his trousers in front of her at a job, the left will shout \u00e2\u0080\u009cMe Too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d in solidarity, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be cancelled. If a woman complains because he dropped his trousers in front of her at a gym locker, but he says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a woman, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cancel her. Is that kind? Was it inclusive when the women who objected to that [trouser dropping] were fired for it? Women are still being fired if they dare to say anything against this. Anywhere on the left, some of us may be fired for the offense of appearing at this [alliance]\u00c2\u00a0gathering today. None of the women at liberal organizations can say no to this [transgender] agenda or their peers will destroy them, and that makes their consent to this [transgender ideology] \u00e2\u0080\u0094 their support for it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as meaningful as a hostage statement. Last night, a\u00c2\u00a0woman wrote to me, a progressive reporter who is outspoken and not shy to hold unpopular opinions, to ask for a quote for this [transgender legal] case. And after she got my reply, she said to me, she wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just met Aimee [Stephens, the plaintiff in the lawsuit], she prepares for tomorrow, she is a woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And I asked her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn what way is Stephens a woman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And she said, and I quote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a matter of what I think.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m here [to protest] for her [the reporter] today, even though she probably really dislikes me. It is the right of all women to speak publicly and be able to petition our government for the redress of our grievances and be able to participate openly in the public sphere. I have seen numerous women banned from social media for pointing out that gender transition treatments leave children sterile for life at ages where they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possibly consent to such permanent decisions. But a generation of quirky, stereotype-rejecting kids \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many of whom would grow up to identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, many of whom are autistic \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are being sterilized as minors now. And the only crime that the left or social media companies seem to recognize in this is the crime of women objecting to the wholesale sterilization of vulnerable children. For that, we get accused of \u00e2\u0080\u009cpromoting genocide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There are doctors in the U.S. who will go to work today and oversee the chemical castration of little boys, who will put 14-year-old girls into menopause, and give troubled young girls cosmetic mastectomies. And I object \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and for that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m considered dangerous. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen public calls for every type of harm against those of us who object to the end of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sex-based rights or who object to the sterilization of children. To the people who say \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the only meaningful type of violence [they recognize] is that I refuse to call a man \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still others insist it is violent of me to associate with\u00c2\u00a0conservatives, in spite of the fact that gender activists associate with lots of conservatives, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen anyone have a problem with that. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost like women who say no to these men [who say they are transgender] are just going to be wrong, no matter what we do. Sisters, when a man puts you under constant surveillance and retaliates whenever you say no, and huffs about being indispensable, and he makes you lie to\u00c2\u00a0spare his feelings, and he always puts you in the wrong \u00e2\u0080\u0094 no matter what \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is not a partnership. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abuse. Plan a way out before it gets worse. It will get worse. In closing, to echo my sisters in the U.K., a man can never be a woman. A lesbian can never be male. My name is Natasha Chart from New York state. I will not be forced to lie. I will not submit. The primary victims of the transgender ideology are teens \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including some who would otherwise mature into lesbian women or gay men. But there is no media focus b/c feminists & progressives want more TGs & the L&G groups are steered by transgender donors. https://t.co/bD7c8UNSZe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 23, 2019  Transgender Facts: In general, the transgender ideology says a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal and civic recognition as a man or a woman is determined by their \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender identity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d not by their biology. The ideology also insists that men and women are more or less interchangeable, and it objects to the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view of the two sexes as simultaneously different, complementary, and equal. The transgender advocates want to impose their ideology on Americans by establishing \u00e2\u0080\u009ctransgender rights\u00e2\u0080\u009d laws, which would require the Department of Justice to penalize individuals and groups who insist that biology determines male or female status \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and also shapes peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 likely political, civic, and personal priorities. Polls show the transgender ideology is deeply\u00c2\u00a0unpopular, especially among\u00c2\u00a0women and\u00c2\u00a0parents. In 2017, former President Barack Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency. Multiple\u00c2\u00a0polls\u00c2\u00a0show that most Americans reasonably\u00c2\u00a0wish\u00c2\u00a0to help and comfort people\u00c2\u00a0who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also\u00c2\u00a0reject\u00c2\u00a0the transgender ideology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim\u00c2\u00a0that people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal sex is determined by their feeling of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender identity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d not by biology. A U.K. survey\u00c2\u00a0shows\u00c2\u00a0a similar mix of sympathy for people who say they are transgender alongside lopsided opposition to the ideology. The transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have competing goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists,\u00c2\u00a0progressives, feminists who wish to\u00c2\u00a0blur\u00c2\u00a0distinctions\u00c2\u00a0between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the\u00c2\u00a0differences\u00c2\u00a0between the two sexes. It includes high-profile\u00c2\u00a0children, people who are\u00c2\u00a0trying\u00c2\u00a0to live as members of the opposite sex, troubled teenage girls trying to\u00c2\u00a0flee\u00c2\u00a0womanhood, and people trying to \u00e2\u0080\u009cde-transition\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0back\u00c2\u00a0to their sex. It also includes men who\u00c2\u00a0demand\u00c2\u00a0sex from\u00c2\u00a0lesbians, masculine\u00c2\u00a0autogynephiles\u00c2\u00a0who say they are entitled to women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights, alpha males\u00c2\u00a0who insist they are the natural leaders of women,\u00c2\u00a0parents\u00c2\u00a0eager\u00c2\u00a0to support their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0099 transgender claims, wealthy\u00c2\u00a0donors,\u00c2\u00a0politicians, political\u00c2\u00a0professionals,\u00c2\u00a0revenue-seeking drug companies,\u00c2\u00a0surgeons, and medical service\u00c2\u00a0providers. Transgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few\u00c2\u00a0people\u00c2\u00a0who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118\u00c2\u00a0Americans\u00c2\u00a0surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.\u00c2\u00a0A Pentagon\u00c2\u00a0report\u00c2\u00a0commissioned by former Defense Secretary James Mattis said that \u00e2\u0080\u009crates for genital surgery are exceedingly low \u00e2\u0080\u0094 2% of transgender men and 10% of transgender women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet the gender ideology is\u00c2\u00a0rapidly gaining\u00c2\u00a0power, aided by\u00c2\u00a0huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced the parents of a teenage girl to give\u00c2\u00a0up custody\u00c2\u00a0so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male. The progressive push to bend Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attitudes and their male and female civic society around the idea of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender identity\u00e2\u0080\u009d has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women. These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters\u00c2\u00a0for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys,\u00c2\u00a0K-12\u00c2\u00a0curricula, university speech codes,\u00c2\u00a0religious\u00c2\u00a0freedoms, free\u00c2\u00a0speech, the social status of\u00c2\u00a0women, parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights in childrearing, children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0ideals\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0beauty, culture and civil society, scientific research, prison\u00c2\u00a0safety, civic ceremonies, school\u00c2\u00a0rules, men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sense of masculinity, law\u00c2\u00a0enforcement, military culture, and children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexual privacy. Progressives use the near-universal sexual rejection of transgender people to justify their demand that government sneak another sexual revolution into Americans' lives & communities. The goal is ending \"compulsory heterosexuality\" & the \"gender binary.\" https://t.co/En8OHnfmXA \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 6, 2019 ",

You will be held accountable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Earlier Tuesday, the White House sent a letter to Pelosi\u00c2\u00a0stating it refuses to cooperate with the probe and blasted it as \u00e2\u0080\u009cillegitimate and unconstitutional.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The letter, written by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, accused the speaker of attempting to \u00e2\u0080\u009coverturn the results\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the 2016 presidential election. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiven that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to participate in it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter read. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause participating in this inquiry under the current unconstitutional posture would inflict lasting institutional harm on the Executive Branch and lasting damage to the separation of powers, you have the President no choice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cConsistent with the duties of the President of the United States, and in particular his obligation to preserve the rights of future occupants of his office, President Trump cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it added. Pelosi launched the impeachment probe against President Trump\u00c2\u00a0on September 24th after a partisan CIA officer accused the president in a so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d complaint of asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into allegations of corruption against former Vice President\u00c2\u00a0Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Both presidents have denied any pressure was applied to probe into the Bidens, and in a nod to transparency, the White House released a transcript of the world leaders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 call to illustrate no wrongdoing occurred. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had I think good phone call.

      "subtitle": "United States Senate candidate Kris Kobach is calling out a Kansas sanctuary city, demanding they drop their policy of shielding criminal illegal aliens from deportation and committing to lead the fight to defund sanctuary cities nationwide.",
      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " This week, Roeland Park, Kansas Police Chief John Morris announced his department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new sanctuary policy that bans police officers from turning criminal illegal aliens over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency for deportation. During a press conference on Tuesday, Kobach called on the Roeland Park Police Department to drop the policy and vowed to defund sanctuary cities nationwide if elected to the Senate in the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2020 senatorial race. Kobach said: It is a sad day for Kansas when one of its cities puts the interests of illegal aliens over the safety of its own citizens. When ICE seeks custody of an illegal alien it is almost always because the alien has a criminal past or is a known gang member. Roeland Park is now going to be releasing those illegal aliens onto the street. The Roeland Park policy severely restricts its officers from sending this information. The city is breaking federal law by adopting this policy, but unfortunately federal law doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include penalties for cities that disobey it. As Senator, I will push to restrict federal funds to sanctuary cities that put American lives in danger. Many lives have been taken by illegal aliens in Kansas. This sanctuary policy increases the chances that more lives will be lost. Kobach detailed recent cases where Americans have been killed by illegal aliens in the Kansas City metro area, including a March 2016 quadruple homicide allegedly committed by illegal alien Pablo Antonio-Vitorino, the September 2016 killing of Johnson County Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Deputy Brandon Collins by illegal alien Adrian Espinosa-Flores, and the death of Amanda Bixby in February 2007 at the hands of illegal alien Ricardo De-Leon. Angel Dad Dennis Bixby said he is forever separated from his daughter Amanda because of illegal immigration in Kansas: There will be no more birthdays, no holidays, no wedding for me to give her away, and no grandchildren. City council members should ask themselves how they would respond to a grieving parent or family when they are asked why they so callously approved this policy. For years, Kobach has sought to ban sanctuary cities in Kansas. One of Kobach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opponents in the GOP primary\u00c2\u00a0 Senate, Susan Wagle \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who has been Kansas Senate President since 2013 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 previously blocked his 2017 effort to outlaw sanctuary cities in the state in 2017. The legislation passed out of committee with majority support, but Wagle failed to ever bring the bill to a vote. Full Disclosure: Kris Kobach writes a weekly column for Breitbart News.

According to an investigative report by the Providence Journal\u00e2\u0080\u0098s Brian Amaral and Katie Mulvaney, Francisco was convicted in 2005 for dealing crack cocaine and powder cocaine. The conviction was Francisco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third drug conviction and therefore he was given a mandatory life sentence in federal prison. After Trump signed the First Step Act into law, though, Francisco had his life sentence for crack dealing reduced and he was released in February of this year, along with the other 3,100 convicts released this year by the new law. Before his release, Francisco pleaded with the court that he had turned his life around, noting his taking part in rehabilitation programs in prison, which advocates of the First Step Act readily cited to make their case that even violent convicts could be reformed and thus released. On July 13, about six months after being released from prison, Francisco was accused of breaking into the home of his ex-girlfriend. When police arrived at the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, they found Francisco standing on her porch and a pocket knife in the nearby bushes that he had allegedly used to cut a window screen. Francisco was subsequently charged with domestic violence. Then, three months later on October 2nd, Francisco was accused of stabbing to death 46-year-old Troy Pine at a hookah lounge in the Federal Hill neighborhood. Since the alleged murder, Francisco has been on the run. Police, as Amaral and Mulvaney note in their Providence Journal report, had warned of such a scenario before the First Step Act allowed Francisco to be released from prison. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome criminals deserve to spend their lives incarcerated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Providence Police Department Deputy Chief Thomas Verdi told the Providence Journal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJoel is one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Providence Police Department is asking anyone with information on Francisco and his whereabouts to contact (401) 243-6332. In November 2018, Breitbart News reported that the First Step Act would result in the release of thousands of drug traffickers from prison despite their dealing deadly drugs such as fentanyl and heroin. A report this year by Fox News\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tucker Carlson stated that the First Step Act had successfully released about 240 sex offenders, nearly 60 convicted murderers and assailants, as well as almost 1,000 inmates convicted for drug crimes.

Warren writes: Ensuring employers can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exploit undocumented workers and drive down standards for all workers: The 2002 Supreme Court case Hoffman Plastic Compounds v. NLRB held that an undocumented worker could not receive the backpay he was owed from an employer who had violated the NLRA. That 5\u00e2\u0080\u00934 ruling is wrong and denies millions of undocumented workers redress for illegal firings or other retaliatory conduct by an employer. The case encourages employers to hire undocumented immigrants and exploit them in numerous fields, including construction and manufacturing, which could lower wages for all workers. I will fight to amend the NLRA to end this form of exploitation and ensure that all workers are protected. [Emphasis added] Despite her platform of populist economic patriotism, Warren has committed to driving up foreign competition against America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working and middle class in the U.S. labor market by providing amnesty for 11 to 22 million illegal aliens, increasing current legal immigration levels, and decriminalizing illegal immigration. Warren Undercuts Populist Agenda with Donor Class Immigration Planhttps://t.co/RAdJlUT44k \u00e2\u0080\u0094 John Binder \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u00bd (@JxhnBinder) August 28, 2019  Absent from Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s workers plan is a mandate and punishment for employers and businesses who hire illegal aliens over American citizens, as well as a reform to the H-1B visa program whereby Americans are readily replaced by foreign visa workers to increase profit margins for multinational corporations. Warren has not endorsed mandatory E-Verify\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 a system that prevents businesses from hiring illegal aliens over Americans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 though it would decrease foreign competition against Americans, especially those most vulnerable to competing against illegal aliens in the labor market. In contrast to Warren is President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s populist-nationalist \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuy American, Hire American\u00e2\u0080\u009d agenda, which has sought to increase interior immigration enforcement to tighten the labor market and delivered wage hikes for America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blue-collar and working class. Unlike Warren, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest national immigration plan includes a nationwide mandate of E-Verify to prevent Americans from being forced to compete for jobs against illegal aliens. Today, there are at least eight million illegal aliens holding American jobs in the U.S. economy that would have otherwise gone to American workers and legal immigrants.

      "author": "Kristina Wong",
      "content": "  House Democrat leaders pursuing the investigation are intent on pushing Trump out of office by any means necessary, Republican lawmakers and the White House argued. House Democrats have carried out the entire process behind closed doors since the beginning of the impeachment inquiry last month. The Democrats have even refused to hold a full House vote on authorizing an impeachment inquiry, just as lawmakers did when Congress opened investigations with Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters in Congress argue that such a vote is necessary to legitimize the inquiry per the recognized standards of previous impeachment efforts and to give Republicans certain rights in the process, such as the ability to issue subpoenas for witnesses. The White House challenged House Democrats in an October 8 letter to the Speaker and committee chairmen pursuing the impeachment inquiry. The White House argued it would not cooperate in the ongoing impeachment investigation and dismissed the proceedings as a mock court focused on overturning the 2016 election results. Republicans say conducting an impeachment inquiry without a full vote in the House is a departure from previous impeachment inquiries under Nixon and Clinton. Witnesses called to testify in the so-called impeachment inquiry so far have done so in closed sessions with lawmakers. Republicans have accused House Democrats of cherry-picking and mischaracterizing evidence, and refusing to release information they say obliterates their accusations of wrongdoing. House Democrats last week leaked text messages provided by one of the witnesses, former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, that appeared damaging to the president, but Republicans said the release of the entire transcript of Volker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks would disprove their allegations. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-AZ), slammed the Democrats for holding \u00e2\u0080\u009csecret hearings\u00e2\u0080\u009d and called on them to release the transcript of Volker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony: After claiming for more than two years that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to influence the 2016 election, Adam Schiff and his band of Democrats are back to their old tricks of manufacturing evidence to fit their narrative. This time, however, they are holding secret hearings to prevent the American people from learning the facts and deciding for themselves.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They have leaked portions of the transcript and select documents from the Volker deposition in a desperate attempt to deceive the country. The American people deserve transparency, and we are calling on these chairmen to immediately deliver the full and complete transcript immediately. The president on Tuesday announced that he would not let Ambassador Gordon Sondland testify to Congress later that day as scheduled. Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY), a supporter of the president, called the inquiry a \u00e2\u0080\u009ckangaroo court\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cclown show\u00e2\u0080\u009d: As far as the administration goes, if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to send Amb. Sondland here because this is a kangaroo court, because there has not been a vote once on impeachment inquiry, because minority does not have any rights for subpoenas, because the president doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the right to have counsel present to ask questions, for subpoena power, to present evidence. This entire thing is a political charade. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a clown show. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) called House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain Kangaroo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we see in this impeachment is a kangaroo court, and Chairman Schiff is acting like a malicious Captain Kangaroo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. House Democrats have also denied President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s counsel the ability to attend depositions, briefings, and interviews. It is also unclear whether or not the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s counsel will be permitted to object to testimony or introduce evidence. House Democrats are also considering having the first official who filed a whistleblower complaint against Trump testify remotely with his face and voice obscured so that Republican lawmakers and staffers would not be able to find out his identity. A lawyer for the whistleblower told Breitbart News on Tuesday that the official, or any others they represent, do not intend to come forward publicly, raising the prospect that an impeachment inquiry of Trump would be prompted entirely by an anonymous official who is reportedly a Democrat and had a working relationship with a 2020 Democrat candidate. The mainstream media has downplayed or flat out ignored that the impeachment proceedings have not met the recognized standards of other similar efforts. The Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are pursuing the impeachment of Trump. Schiff and the chairmen of the other two panels argue that Trump attempted to coerce Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his son in exchange for foreign aid, a claim denied by the U.S. president.",

Not as a coach, not as an assistant, but as a player.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confusing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asserted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour entire team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus and motivation is lost and defeated before you even start.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace said that her team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spirit of \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, we can!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was quickly replaced by \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy try?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She explained that when the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hitting ability gave the opposing team an edge of a couple of runs, her team of female athletes could not recover and ended up losing. Grace observed how allowing biological men to play women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sports is defeating the goal of an \u00e2\u0080\u009cequal playing field\u00e2\u0080\u009d federal law is supposed to protect. She said many female athletes who have to compete against males will lose out on sports scholarships to colleges. A recent study in Sweden has\u00c2\u00a0shown\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0biological males who claim to be transgender women still retained considerable advantages over biological females in strength and muscle mass, even after a full year of hormone therapy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespite the robust increases in muscle mass and strength in [transgender men], the [transgender women] were still stronger and had more muscle mass following 12 months of treatment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the researchers said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese findings add new knowledge that could be relevant when evaluating transwomen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligibility to compete in the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s category of athletic competitions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In another study, researchers\u00c2\u00a0concluded\u00c2\u00a0that male athletes who claim to be female hold an \u00e2\u0080\u009cintolerable\u00e2\u0080\u009d advantage over biological female athletes. Three professors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 two in bioethics and one in physiology \u00e2\u0080\u0094 noted the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is allowing \u00e2\u0080\u009ctransgender women\u00e2\u0080\u009d to compete against biological females if their testosterone is below 10 nmol/L. However, even that level is \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificantly higher\u00e2\u0080\u009d than that of biological females, they asserted. The researchers also stated that \u00e2\u0080\u009cindirect effects of testosterone will not be altered by hormone therapy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor example, hormone therapy will not alter bone structure, lung volume or heart size of the transwoman athlete, especially if she transitions postpuberty, so natural advantages including joint articulation, stroke volume and maximal oxygen uptake will be maintained,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe conclude that the advantage to transwomen afforded by the IOC guidelines is an intolerable unfairness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d state the professors.",

      "content": " For the first time on record, the wealthiest 400 Americans in 2018 paid a lower tax rate than all of the income groups in the United States, research highlighted by the New York Times from University of California, Berkeley, economists\u00c2\u00a0Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman finds. The analysis concludes that the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top economic elite are paying lower federal, state, and local tax rates than the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working and middle class. Overall, these top 400 wealthy Americans paid just a 23 percent tax rate, which the Times\u00e2\u0080\u0098 op-ed columnist\u00c2\u00a0David Leonhardt notes is a combined tax payment of \u00e2\u0080\u009cless than one-quarter of their total income.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This 23 percent tax rate for the rich means their rate has been slashed by 47 percentage points since 1950 when their tax rate was 70 percent. (Screenshot via the New York Times) The analysis finds that the 23 percent tax rate for the wealthiest Americans is less than every other income group in the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including those earning working and middle-class incomes, as a Times graphic shows. Leonhardt writes: For middle-class and poor families, the picture is different. Federal income taxes have also declined modestly for these families, but they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t benefited much if at all from the decline in the corporate tax or estate tax. And they now pay more in payroll taxes (which finance Medicare and Social Security) than in the past. Over all, their taxes have remained fairly flat. [Emphasis added] The report comes as Americans increasingly see a growing divide between the rich and working class, as the Pew Research Center has found. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), the leading economic nationalist in the Senate, has warned against the Left-Right coalition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consensus on open trade, open markets, and open borders, a plan that he has called an economy that works solely for the elite. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same consensus says that we need to pursue and embrace economic globalization and economic integration at all costs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 open markets, open borders, open trade, open everything no matter whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually good for American national security or for American workers or for American families or for American principles \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00c2\u00a0this is the elite consensus that has governed our politics for too long and what it has produced is a politics of elite ambition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hawley said in an August speech in the Senate. That increasing worry of rapid income inequality is only further justified by economic research showing a rise in servant-class jobs, strong economic recovery for elite zip codes but not for working-class regions, and skyrocketing wage growth for the billionaire class at 15 times the rate of other Americans.

A thousand percent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said YouTube star Trisha Paytas, in a video that includes advertisements for\u00c2\u00a0tickets to her late-October events in San Francisco and Los Angeles. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m at, and I feel really free and liberated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Paytas quickly apologized when critics claimed her transgender claim ridiculed the transgender movement. The EOnline.com entertainment site reported: In a tearful YouTube\u00c2\u00a0video, the star says that she is \u00e2\u0080\u009coverwhelmed by the amount of backlash\u00e2\u0080\u009d her candid video received. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apologize for who I am and how I feel and it sucks that we live in this world and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just not allowed to identify as a man because of how I look,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s triggering. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PTSD of when I said that I was, like, bisexual.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cPaytas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video is super, duper problematic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says an earnest post at Popdust.com, which continues: One Twitter user compiled a list of just\u00c2\u00a0some\u00c2\u00a0of the statements Paytas made that led me to shout at my screen. These include assertions like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am transgender because I wish I had a penis so that my assertiveness would be respected and I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be thought of as a bitch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and also, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI CHOOSE to identify as boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d No doubt about it, Paytas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video is a trainwreck, and I understand where all the transgender] backlash is coming from. The way she talks about and misidentifies transgenderism dilutes its seriousness, and the visibility of her platform poses a danger for actual transgender people who\u00c2\u00a0need\u00c2\u00a0to be taken seriously in order to get the medical and psychological assistance they need. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Paytas has every right to express herself as gender nonconforming. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than welcome to present herself as male. But that does not make her transgender. Transgender people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t choose to be transgender. Nobody chooses to have gender dysphoria. So many transgender issues revolve around access to\u00c2\u00a0healthcare\u00c2\u00a0procedures to correct the underlying issue of dysphoria. It is not a choice.  Her video earned her over 84,000 downvotes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and a shipload of publicity:  She posted a tearful apology video:  But the progressives who power the transgender ideology are not pushing sexual liberation. They are imposing a regime of sexual autonomy that would deny people the right to use the social rules that humans have gradually evolved to manage the cooperation and competition between the two complementary and equal legal sexes. The radical goals were recently endorsed by\u00c2\u00a0the Americal Psychological Society, which\u00c2\u00a0awarded a prize\u00c2\u00a0in 2018 to\u00c2\u00a0an article calling for a cultural revolution that ends the dominant role of heterosexuality in society: There are enormous costs to maintaining the gender binary. These costs include the myriad negative consequences of gender stereotyping and prejudice. For these reasons, the gender binary should be replaced by a conception of gender/sex that stresses multiplicity and diversity, including a multiplecategory (rather than binary) system, whose categories are not mutually exclusive (one can identify as more than one), fluid (one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity can change across time), and allow for the possibility that gender is viewed as irrelevant to the self. To change the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view that heterosexuality is the normal and best path for most people, the pro-transgender progressives have adopted a strategy of using their allies in universities, media, and marketing to first downplay the linguistic, legal, and civic distinctions between the two sexes. For example, progressives are using the vague idea of\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender\u00e2\u0080\u009d to bury the obvious notion of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmale or female.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This rhetorical carpet-bombing has also encouraged the claim that men who live as women possess a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfemale penis\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and it denies women the right to call themselves transgender if they also love men.

He called for Brussels to raise the number of troops to at least 55,000 to 60,000. Such a force would be larger than the standing armies of Portugal (35,000) or the Netherlands (43,000). \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should pull our national sovereignties together to multiply the power of individual member states. And I am convinced that if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t act together, Europe will become irrelevant in the new coming world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Brussels currently has \u00e2\u0080\u009cbattlegroups\u00e2\u0080\u009d of 3,000 soldiers from across militaries of EU Member States, according to The Telegraph. The battlegroups are on standby every six months but have not, to date, been used. To increase those forces by twenty-fold and make them permanent, Brussels would need the unanimous support of Member States.  Brexit Party leader and MEP Nigel Farage raised the alarm over the calls for a permanent EU army. He said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe EU is now aiming for an army of 60,000 and incoming foreign policy boss Josep Borrell says: \u00e2\u0080\u0098the EU has to learn to use the language of power.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen will Remainers stop lying about the intentions of this dangerous, undemocratic state?\u00e2\u0080\u009d In 2015, then-leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg called the notion of an EU army a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdangerous fantasy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and ridiculed Mr Farage for saying that the force was the next step in EU empire-building. However, in November 2017, Eurosceptics were proven right when the majority of EU nations\u00c2\u00a0signed\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Permanent Structured Cooperation process (PESCO). The document is instrumental to European Defence Union plans which were devised by outgoing President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, who supports\u00c2\u00a0the foundation of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfully-fledged\u00e2\u0080\u009d EU army by 2025. Last year,\u00c2\u00a0French President Emmanuel Macron called for\u00c2\u00a0a \u00e2\u0080\u009creal European army\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cprotect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America\u00e2\u0080\u009d. German Chancellor\u00c2\u00a0Angela Merkel\u00c2\u00a0and the\u00c2\u00a0European Commission enthusiastically backed the idea. Pro-Brexit group Veterans for Britain has warned that even when the UK leaves the EU, it could still get pulled into defence projects with the bloc. Senior figures met with the European Research Group on Tuesday to brief the group of Eurosceptic Tories on the defence implications of the proposed withdrawal treaty. A Veterans for Britain source told the Express:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Prime Minister may have got rid of the backstop but that was not the only thing that was wrong with the Withdrawal Agreement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe defence element is a serious threat to our sovereignty but this issue has been completely overlooked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ERG Chairman Steve Baker said the UK must \u00e2\u0080\u009cescape commitments to the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Defence Union.

Devin Nunes (R-CA) noted the procedure employed by House Democrats in its so-called impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump is proceeding unlike impeachment efforts in the past and with rules. That according to the California Republican does not allow for a fair process for both sides. Partial transcript as follows: CARLSON: Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. So if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m understanding this correctly, the White House is saying once you make it official, we will cooperate, but not until then. NUNES: Well, the House Intelligence Committee has become like this secretive impeachment committee but with no rules. And so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blame the White House for saying, look, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just see you in court. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to provide you any witnesses. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to provide you any documents and unless the House of Representatives votes, like has been the tradition, if not, you can hold us in contempt and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see you in court in a matter of months, maybe important months. CARLSON: But now as a procedural matter, is it true or is it not? I mean, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the sitting member, that the House in order to have an impeachment you have to have a vote, right? Leadership can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just say there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an impeachment, there has to be a vote. NUNES: Right? You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I mean, traditionally, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the House makes its own rules. OK. So one could argue that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just making up the rules as they go along. But we do have tradition. Right? And you have precedents. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relatively recent, right? You had the impeachment of Bill Clinton, and the impeachment of Richard Nixon. So if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really going to truly get this through the House, open up an investigation, pass it, vote to impeach a President, send it to the Senate for trial, you have to have a system of government where you have something that is fair, where both sides can actually go out and gather evidence. CARLSON: Right. NUNES: And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist today and I think the White House has a very good point, because as someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been in all these meetings, I can tell you, I think it was described today as a kangaroo court and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably being nice. CARLSON: Yes, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have an impeachment, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have a vote. You know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a democracy. We vote on things here, like we always used to.

Khan added that he had \u00e2\u0080\u009cheard that some 400 ministerial-level people had been convicted on charges of corruption and put behind jail in the last five years in China.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Khan claimed that legal proceedings in Pakistan were \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery cumbersome\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it was, therefore, difficult to purge politicians the way that Xi had done using his totalitarian powers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish I could follow President Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s example and put 500 corrupt people in Pakistan in jail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, explaining that corruption was one of the biggest impediments to investment in the country.

(PARKER SONG/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Following his rise to power in 2012, Xi launched an anti-corruption crusade that saw around 1.3 million people, ranging from the Communist Party elite down to local officials, charged with a variety of crimes. Among those detained and disappeared into prison were many political rivals within the Party. Kahn, the former cricketer turned politician, went on to effusively praise China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s achievements over the past few decades, with more than half the population lifted out of poverty and becoming the second-largest economy in the world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat inspires me most about China is the way they have lifted 700 million people out of poverty in 30 years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis has never happened in human history.\u00e2\u0080\u009d China has historically\u00c2\u00a0been\u00c2\u00a0a close ally of Pakistan. Beijing\u00c2\u00a0celebrated Khan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election after he ran on a campaign of improving relations with both China and India by promising to resolve tensions over the disputed Kashmir region. It is the second time that Khan has visited China in the space of a year. The Pakistani prime minister made his first official visit in November last year. During that visit, he made no secret of his admiration for the communist regime, declaring that he wanted to \u00e2\u0080\u009clearn\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cphenomenal achievements.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur country is very impressed with the way China has progressed.

Of course, there are exceptions, like when Mrs. Trump visited Wyoming this past week and wore casual Ralph Lauren-inspired activewear ensembles with sweaters, J Brand skinny jeans, and puffer coats. The photos of Mrs. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wyoming visit are easily some of the most breathtaking portraits she has ever posed for, looking as though they were ripped from the pages of Vogue for a Bruce Weber fashion spread.

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " An unnamed administration official confirmed the move to the Associated Press on Tuesday evening. Gowdy, who retired from Congress last year, represented South Carolina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a04th Congressional District for eight years. The former lawmaker served as House Oversight Committee chairman and oversaw the investigation into former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and the events surrounding the\u00c2\u00a02012 terror attack in\u00c2\u00a0Benghazi, Libya. Since leaving Washington, D.C., Gowdy joined the law firm Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough and signed on as a Fox News Channel contributor. The development came after the White House\u00c2\u00a0sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) confirming it will not cooperate with\u00c2\u00a0the impeachment probe, branding it\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cillegitimate\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cunconstitutional.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The letter, written by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, accused the speaker of attempting to \u00e2\u0080\u009coverturn the results\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the 2016 presidential election. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiven that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to participate in it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter\u00c2\u00a0read. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause participating in this inquiry under the current unconstitutional posture would inflict lasting institutional harm on the Executive Branch and lasting damage to the separation of powers, you have the President no choice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cConsistent with the duties of the President of the United States, and in particular his obligation to preserve the rights of future occupants of his office, President Trump cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it\u00c2\u00a0added. Pelosi responded later Tuesday to President Trump with a letter of her own, vowing to hold him \u00e2\u0080\u009caccountable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis letter is manifestly wrong, and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the California Democrat wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespite the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stonewalling, we see a growing body of evidence that shows that President Trump abused his office and violated his oath to \u00e2\u0080\u0098protect, preserve and defend the Constitution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she concluded. Pelosi kicked off the probe against President Trump\u00c2\u00a0late September after a partisan CIA officer accused the president in a so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d complaint of asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into allegations of corruption against former Vice President\u00c2\u00a0Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Both have denied any pressure was applied to probe into the Biden family, and in a nod to transparency, the White House released a transcript of the presidents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 call to show no wrongdoing occurred. On Tuesday, the\u00c2\u00a0Washington Examiner reported that the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 who had been previously outed as a registered Democrat\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 in fact, had a previously \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofessional relationship\u00e2\u0080\u0099 with a 2020 Democrat White House hopeful.",

Yet after reportedly taking further legal advice and even consulting with the Supreme Court which ruled against the previous suspension, Parliament has now been suspended again, the constitutional ceremony taking place Tuesday evening. The Speaker of the House of Commons and members were summoned to the Lords where the royal notice setting out the suspension was read out. Having run from\u00c2\u00a0June 21st 2017 to October 8th 2019, the session was the longest in British history \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the next longest having taken place in 17th century English parliament before the modern state of the United Kingdom had come to exist. Under more normal circumstances parliamentary sessions are suspended annually and last less than 400 days \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this session lasted 839. Unlike the first effort to close Parliament, the ceremony prompted little media attention and was attended by only a handful of Parliamentarians. Parliamentarians have met some criticism over their attendance at the reactivated Parliament, after protesting the last prorogation was restricting their ability to hold the government to account. British newspaper\u00c2\u00a0The Express reports the remarks of Tory MP Michael Fabricant, who said of the opposition failing to turn up to debates despite having dragged the government through the courts to be able to do so: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo opposition MPs opposed prorogation \u00e2\u0080\u0098to better scrutinise the Government on Brexit\u00e2\u0080\u0099. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet, when that opportunity arises, most of them are absent.

      "author": "Jerome Hudson",
      "content": " Schweizer, who serves as the president of the Government Accountability Institute and is a Breitbart senior contributor, revealed that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. In December 2013, Joe and Hunter Biden flew aboard Air Force Two to China; less than two weeks after the trip, Hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners, which he founded with two other businessmen in June 2013, finalized a deal to open a fund, BHR Partners, whose largest shareholder is the government-run Bank of China, even though he had scant background in private equity.(Representatives of the fund claim that the timing of the deal and the Bidens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trip to China was coincidental). Thus far, the firm has invested about $2.1 billion, according to its website. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 With the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, Joe Biden became point person in Ukraine as well. That same year, Hunter Biden landed a board position with the Ukrainian energy giant Burisma Holdings. Despite having no background in energy or Ukraine, the vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son was paid as much as $50,000 a month, according to financial records. (He left the board in early 2019). \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The Bidens are hardly alone. President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, and her husband, Senator Mitch McConnell, are being accused of having profited from their commercial ties to Beijing. In 2004, the two had a net worth of about $3.1 million, according to public disclosures. Three years later, the range was $3.1 million to $12.7 million. The next year, their net worth rocketed to $7.3 million to $33.1 million. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLast month, the House Oversight and Reform Committee started an investigation into whether Secretary Chao has leveraged her government positions to benefit her family. But so far there is no investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schweizer wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDefenders claim there must first be proof that a law was broken to open an investigation. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly backward. Congress can and should conduct an inquiry to determine whether anything illegal occurred.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The bestselling author called for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cWashington Corrupt Practices Act,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he says would create a legal standard that \u00e2\u0080\u009cclearly shuts down foreign influence and self-enrichment for some of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most powerful families on both sides of the aisle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peter Schweizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0Secret Empires\u00c2\u00a0was first in-depth investigative work to uncover the details behind how Hunter Biden\u00c2\u00a0received millions of dollars from Burisma Holdings while his father, then-Vice President Biden, steered $1.8 billion in aid money to Ukraine.

This includes companies that help China maintain its totalitarian \u00e2\u0080\u009csocial credit\u00e2\u0080\u009d system, violate U.S. and international sanctions, illegally develop disputed islands in the South China Sea, and improve its military capabilities with advanced weapons. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday, such Chinese companies are being underwritten \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in many cases unwittingly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 by American pension funds and other institutional and individual investors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is at least $6 trillion that investors passively invest in the benchmarked Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) All-Country World Index, which has 6% of its portfolio (shortly going to 7% or another $60 billion) invested in the stocks of Communist China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corporations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorse yet, the federal retirement system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Thrift Savings Plan is set up to mirror this MSCI index starting next year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that happens, U.S. government employees \u00e2\u0080\u0093 past and present, military and civilian \u00e2\u0080\u0093 risk having their pension funds underwrite the Chinese Communist Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s malevolent enterprises.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is especially intolerable to those of us who have proudly served the Nation in uniform that our retirement investments will help its enemies threaten our comrades-in-arms and the country we love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the signatories declared. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe call on President Trump to prevent the Thrift Savings Plan from being tapped by companies tied to the Chinese Communist Party and thereby ensure that federal retirees will not wind up financing our foes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they wrote. The letter was signed by retired veterans U.S. Army Lt. Gen. William \u00e2\u0080\u009cJerry\u00e2\u0080\u009d Boykin, U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Robert Spalding, Lt. Col. Allen West, Col. Darrell Smith, and Gunnery Sgt. Jessie Jane Duff. West is also a former member of the House of Representatives. The authors of the letter are not alone in asking the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) to refrain from investing in Chinese companies. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) published a similar appeal at CNBC on September 30, noting that it would have been \u00e2\u0080\u009cunthinkable\u00e2\u0080\u009d to compel American military personnel and government employees to invest in Soviet companies during the Cold War. Rubio and Shaheen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s article named several of the companies to which Boykin, McInerney, and their fellow signatories alluded, including surveillance technology firm Hikvision, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, and telecom corporation ZTE. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investors should never be a source of wealth funding the Chinese Communist Party at the expense of our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future prosperity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the senators declared. Rubio and Shaheen wrote a letter of their own to FRTIB chairman Michael Kennedy in late August, asking him to reverse the decision to invest in Chinese enterprises and explain how that decision was originally reached. The Trump administration is currently considering restrictions on investment portfolio money flowing into China, prominently including the portfolios of U.S. government retirement funds. The Chinese government has indicated such a move would disrupt trade talks and prompt Beijing to retaliate.",

Jim Himes (D-CT) on impeachment, asking him what the House Democrats are waiting for when it comes to voting on articles of impeachment given that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) believes there is ample evidence of obstruction of justice against President Donald Trump. Camerota asked Himes why not vote on articles of impeachment now, to which Himes said House Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u009cneed an opportunity to talk to the witnesses who were in the room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeaking of articles of impeachment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Camerota posed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit sounds as though Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi now believes there is ample evidence of obstruction of justice given that the Ambassador Gordon Sondland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance was canceled, given this letter and that there is evidence of asking a foreign power for help investigating a political rival in the upcoming election. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all seen the transcript. So, what are you waiting for? Why not vote on the articles of impeachment now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009c[I]mpeachment is a serious thing, Alisyn, and we need an opportunity to talk to the witnesses who were in the room,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Himes replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, despite what the president is saying, the whistleblower complaint is very specific and it is fully corroborated as you point out by the so-called transcript that the White House put out there, and by the way, by the president himself, who looked into a whole bunch of television cameras and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey China, you too ought to investigate Joe Biden.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 You know, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, the facts aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really much in dispute here but you know, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rush to judgment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to do away with a lot of the absolute baloney that people like the secretary of state of the United States of America have been putting out there so the American people understand the facts about what is happening here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he later added.

Whether he did or didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything wrong\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no proof that he did\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump keeps bringing that up, is there an optical problem for Joe Biden because he son was in a position to be making a lot of money from a company that was in a foreign country? HILLARY CLINTON:\u00c2\u00a0You know, Judy, this is the goal of the Trump strategy: It is to raise questions. There is no evidence that either one of them did anything wrong. Could there be a question of judgment about his son? Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair game. But there is absolutely no evidence, and there will not be any evidence, that Joe Biden did anything wrong. Enough with these wild unfounded conspiracy theories. Using the help of foreign governments to interfere in our election and to undermine people who have been in the public eye for a long time and I hope the American people reject this, as they should. In recent days, President Donald Trump has suggested China and Ukraine investigate alleged corruption committed by the Biden family.\u00c2\u00a0As Breitbart News extensively reported, Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment company scored a\u00c2\u00a0$1.5 billion investment deal\u00c2\u00a0with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013. Further,\u00c2\u00a0then-vice president\u00c2\u00a0Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating the gas giant Burisma Holdings, which was paying Hunter Biden $83,000 monthly as a member of its board, despite his lack of expertise in the energy sector. Biden later\u00c2\u00a0boasted\u00c2\u00a0before the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. Clinton may have a personal dog in this fight, as the Biden allegations first came from a book by Peter Schweizer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 investigative journalist, president of the Government Accountability Institute, and senior contributor to Breitbart News \u00e2\u0080\u0094 called Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends. The book functions as a spiritual sequel to Schweizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich. That book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s findings, confirmed even by Democrat-friendly corporate media, became a major problem for her campaign and may have helped in the decline of The Clinton Foundation.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",

The couple\u00c2\u00a0claimed\u00c2\u00a0the right to create videos that are consistent with their faith beliefs about marriage between one man and one woman. Ellison announced he will go back to trial to prove \u00e2\u0080\u009cLGBTQ discrimination is not free speech,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as he accused the Larsens of using their faith beliefs as a front to be able to discriminate against LGBT individuals. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBusiness owners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 free speech and beliefs are already fully protected under the First Amendment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ellison wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat they want is a license to discriminate against LGBTQ folks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  According to Ellison, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cright to be free from discrimination in public\u00e2\u0080\u009d is of greater value than religious liberty, though he also claims the First Amendment assures \u00e2\u0080\u009cno law can\u00e2\u0080\u009d tell people what they can believe. Ellison claimed\u00c2\u00a0the Eighth Circuit panel is simply telling the Larsens and their video company, Telescope Media Group, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit can hide behind \u00e2\u0080\u0098free speech\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to discriminate against LGBTQ couples.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not letting it go unchallenged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asserted, but added appealing the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court would not be a realistic option: [T]he current makeup of that court means we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not likely to win, because the court would have to accept Telescope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fairy tale as true, since there are no other actual facts on record at this early stage of the case. A loss there would make this kind of discrimination against LGBTQ people the law everywhere in America. Instead, the best path forward is to take the case back to federal district court. There, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to help the trial court establish a set of facts based in reality. Then, if it ends up on appeal again, including before the Supreme Court, the appellate courts will have to accept those facts as true, not Telescope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fanciful story. Ironically, Ellison believes his path is one that keeps \u00e2\u0080\u009chonoring the First Amendment, which allows everyone to believe what they want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Donald Trump will hold\u00c2\u00a0a Keep America Great rally in Minneapolis Thursday.

But I guess the onus is on those people to explain what the national interest is in Syria for us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll these same people who wanted to stay were advocates for getting into the middle of this Syrian civil war. They were all advocates for toppling Gaddhafi, they were all advocates for toppling Hussein, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been wrong about everything in foreign policy for the last several decades,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten us involved in quagmire after quagmire, extraordinarily expensive, I agree with the president that the expense in both blood and treasure is disproportionate, something I think most Americans would actually agree with president that this is not a war that our national interest is at stake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A senior National Security Council official told reporters on Tuesday that the American troops, which number about 50 in northern Syria, would be redeployed elsewhere in Syria, contrary to reports suggesting that Trump with withdrawing all U.S. troops there. During the height of the U.S.-led war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), there were about 2,000 U.S. forces in Syria. The administration has pushed to reduce that to a presence of about 400. Paul said the backlash over moving 50 troops within Syria shoes the \u00e2\u0080\u009clunacy\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the war caucus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 criticism. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis goes to the lunacy of the war caucus yelling and screaming over moving 50 soldiers.\u00c2\u00a0 For Goodness sake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s they want to lose 50 in the wake of a 600,000 person Turkish Army. Who are these armchair generals?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Paul argued the approximately 50 forces are not a deterrent \u00e2\u0080\u009cto anybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a lot of different scattered special forces in those areas, but we have no deterrent to anybody\u00e2\u0080\u00a6it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like we have a big army there to deter Turkey from coming in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He also said the U.S. could not be responsible for all the refugees that would result from a Turkish offensive or refugees who are currently residing in Turkey. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we were to deter Turkey from coming in, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be responsible for all those refugees? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like three million refugees \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are we going to be responsible for them forever? The president makes a good point on the captured ISIS fighters and families \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are we going to house 90,000 people until the end of time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen are the Europeans going to step up and do anything?\u00c2\u00a0When are they locally going to do something? The Turks have at least stood up and said they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to do something about it, so I think the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made the right decision and anybody advocating, telling the president or demanding that the president leave 50 troops in place is somebody who really hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thought through the consequences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Paul also slammed Democrats who have are for foreign policy restraint but are not backing up the president on his decision. Even the supposedly anti-war, ultra-progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) criticized Trump for moving the 50 U.S. troops from northern Syria. Paul chalked it up to \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump Derangement Syndrome\u00e2\u0080\u009d: I think that why you hear such a uniform racket going after the president is the Democrats go after the president because of Trump derangement syndrome. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like him politically, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the middle of a continuous campaign. And so there are Democrats who probably do think it was ill-advised to be in the middle of the Syrian civil war but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone quiet or dormant since their preoccupation is more with expressing their displeasure for Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Republicans are actually more predictable in the sense that the neo-con hawks in our party really, like I said, never met a war they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

The 30-second clip, titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cBiden Corruption,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is running on several national cable networks and online. To run the ad, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2020 campaign spent $8 million, while the Republican National Committee (RNC) chipped in $2 million.  Biden campaign spokesperson\u00c2\u00a0TJ Ducklo responded angrily to Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision, calling it\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cunacceptable\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said that the flow of\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cobjectively false information to influence public opinion poisons the public discourse and chips away at our democracy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He did not comment on the substance of the ad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claims.

      "content": " Business Insider reports\u00c2\u00a0that Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), have written a letter asking payment processors Mastercard, Visa, and Stripe to reconsider their involvement with Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new digital cryptocurrency Libra. The Libra digital currency was started by Facebook and is designed to be used for online purchases and digital money transfers. Libra will be led by a group of different firms via the non-profit group the Libra Association and is planned to be launched in 2020. Visa, Mastercard, and Stripe are three of the 27 firms that comprise the Libra Association. The letter sent by the senators to the payment processors focused on a report from the Wall Street Journal which claimed that Visa and Mastercard were reconsidering their involvement with the project. The letter states: We urge you to carefully consider how your companies will manage these risks before proceeding, given that Facebook has not yet demonstrated to Congress, financial regulators \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and perhaps not even to your companies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that it is taking these risks seriously. Although the project has yet to fully launch and was only announced in June, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already lost a major firm this week with PayPal announcing its departure from the Libra association. PayPal did state that it\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cremains supportive of Libra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aspirations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but would no longer be involved in the project. President Trump has previously criticized the virtual currency stating that it will have \u00e2\u0080\u009clittle standing or dependability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The European Union also began an official investigation into Libra over competition concerns in August while French finance minister Bruno le Maire said that France \u00e2\u0080\u009ccannot authorize\u00e2\u0080\u009d Libra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development in Europe over consumer risk concerns.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday unveiled her plan to address \u00e2\u0080\u009cenvironmental injustice\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cenvironmental racism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which includes a $1 trillion investment into minority communities affected by \u00e2\u0080\u009cindustrial pollution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren argues that \u00e2\u0080\u009cjustice\u00e2\u0080\u009d plays a massive role in properly addressing the climate change \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrisis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d citing studies that suggest that black and Hispanic families are disproportionately affected by air pollution caused by white people: A more recent study found that while whites largely cause air pollution, Blacks and Latinxs are more likely to breathe it in. Unsurprisingly, these groups also experience higher rates of childhood asthma. And many more low-income and minority communities are exposed to toxins in their water \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including lead and chemicals from industrial and agricultural run-off. Warren calls this phenomenon \u00e2\u0080\u009cenvironmental racism\u00e2\u0080\u009d and concludes that \u00e2\u0080\u009cenvironmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She previewed her plan in a video clip featuring far-left \u00e2\u0080\u009cSquad\u00e2\u0080\u009d member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need a government that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the side of families\u00e2\u0080\u0094not giant corporations polluting our communities. @RashidaTlaib and I walked through 48217, the most polluted zip code in Michigan, and talked with the families living every day with the effects of pollution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren tweeted alongside the clip: We need a government that's on the side of families\u00e2\u0080\u0094not giant corporations polluting our communities. @RashidaTlaib and I walked through 48217, the most polluted zip code in Michigan, and talked with the families living every day with the effects of pollution. pic.twitter.com/LsXlZQza7r \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 8, 2019  Like Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other proposals, her environmental injustice plan weaves in aspects of her other campaign promises. For instance, Warren says her housing plan will provide an assistance program, aimed to get impoverished families out of poor, pollution-ridden neighborhoods and into the \u00e2\u0080\u009cneighborhood of their choice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She also pledges to invest one-third \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or $1 trillion\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 of her climate change investment \u00e2\u0080\u009cinto the most vulnerable communities,\u00e2\u0080\u009d although she does not specify what the $1 trillion will be spent on, specifically. Like most of Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans, her environmental injustice proposal involves the implementation of another tax. In this instance, it is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuperfund Waste Tax.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her plan states: There are over 1300 remaining Superfund sites across the country, many located in or adjacent to frontline communities. So-called \u00e2\u0080\u009corphan\u00e2\u0080\u009d toxic waste clean-ups were originally funded by a series of excise taxes on the petroleum and chemical industries. But thanks to Big Oil and other industry lobbyists, when that tax authority expired in 1995 it was not renewed. Polluters must pay for the consequences of their actions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not leave them for the communities to clean up. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work with Congress to reinstate and then triple the Superfund tax, generating needed revenue to clean up the mess. The presidential hopeful even weaves in Medicare for All as part of her broader proposal, arguing such a system will \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake it easier for the federal government to quickly tailor health care responses to specific environmental disasters in affected communities when they occur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren also reiterates her pledge to \u00e2\u0080\u009censure that employers and our government honor the promises they made to workers in fossil fuel industries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve fought for years to protect pensions and health benefits for retired coal workers, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue fighting to maintain the solvency of multi-employer pension plans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs president, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll protect those benefits that fossil fuel workers have earned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in crafting a petition to the Supreme Court on behalf of LTV Steel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which helped the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfight against a congressional requirement\u00c2\u00a0 that it pay millions of dollars into a fund for its retired coal miners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 health care\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0calls her promise into question. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve traveled this country, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard the human stories from frontline communities.

We need big, structural change, focused on and led by members of those communities. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 9, 2019  As we work to enact the #GreenNewDeal, I'll make sure that frontline community leaders who know best what their neighborhoods need are elevated in my White House and lead the way toward the big, structural change we need.

The former secretary of state continued, calling the partisan-fueled impeachment inquiry the \u00e2\u0080\u009cappropriate remedy\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cserious assault on our democracy that is apparently asked for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo impeachment is the appropriate remedy, and it is such a serious assault on our democracy that is apparently asked for, aided and abetted by not only the president but his allies who seem not to either care or understand how deeply dangerous this is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am all in favor of what the House is doing and gathering the evidence and making the case because this president has to be held to account because of his unconstitutional abuse of power, his contempt of Congress, and his obstruction of justice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. President Trump suggested on Tuesday that \u00e2\u0080\u009cCrooked Hillary\u00e2\u0080\u009d should join the race \u00e2\u0080\u009cto try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the condition of explaining \u00e2\u0080\u009call of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u00e2\u0080\u0098C\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Subpoena!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Clinton replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tempt me. Do your job,\u00e2\u0080\u009d fueling speculation that she is considering another presidential run. I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u00e2\u0080\u009cC\u00e2\u0080\u009d Subpoena! \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019  Clinton recently floated the possibility of a rematch on PBS NewsHour: You know, it truly is remarkable how obsessed he remains with me. But this latest tweet is so typical of him. Nothing has been more examined and looked at than my emails. We all know that. So, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either lying or delusional, or both. There was no subpoena, as he says in a tweet this morning. So, maybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again. But, just seriously, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation. Clinton is expected to host \u00e2\u0080\u009cDinner and a Conversation\u00e2\u0080\u009d in her Washington, DC, home this month in partnership with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Leadership Forum, adding to the speculation of another presidential bid on the horizon.",

      "subtitle": "One of the many news-making revelations in Ronan Farrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upcoming book,\u00c2\u00a0Catch and Kill, is that he received pressure from Hillary Clinton to back off his reporting on Harvey Weinstein.",
      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " The far-left Hollywood Reporter, which received an advanced copy of the book, naturally buried this bombshell under no fewer than 20 paragraphs and a headline that says nothing about Madame Clinton. What we also learn is that while Weinstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move to leverage his relationship with Hillary Clinton was successful in putting pressure on Farrow, Weinstein was not able to leverage his relationship with filmmaker Woody Allen (Weinstein financed and produced a number of Allen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s films) to help him with Farrow. Allen, who is Farrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, reportedly told the soon-to-be-disgraced mogul, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJeez, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sorry. Good luck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the relevant Hollywood Reporter excerpt (emphasis mine): Weinstein also attempted to leverage his long-term relationship with Hillary Clinton to pressure Farrow, he writes. In summer 2017, while Farrow was trying to lock down an interview with Clinton for his foreign policy book \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while also still working on the Weinstein story \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he received a call from Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s publicist, Nick Merrill, who told him that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig story\u00e2\u0080\u009d Farrow was working on was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconcern for us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, in September 2017, according to an email cited in the book, Weinstein wrote to Deborah Turness, the ex-president of NBC News who now runs NBC News International, to propose a docuseries on Clinton. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Hillary doc series sounds absolutely stunning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turness responded. Weinstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tentacles even stretched to Farrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own estranged father. Days before the\u00c2\u00a0Times\u00c2\u00a0story broke, Weinstein is said to have called Allen on a film set in Central Park, soliciting advice about how to deal with his son. Allen declined: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJeez, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sorry. Good luck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Please note that Merrill is Hillary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longtime publicist. He works for her, and it seems unlikely he would do such a thing without her instructions. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, as of now, Merrill has not denied the reporting. To understand just how awful Hillary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior is here, you have to keep in mind the context of the time, of what was happening in 2017. To begin with, as Breitbart News reported in December 2017, there are credible reports Hillary Clinton had known about Weinstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alleged sexual misconduct and abuse going back to her failed 2016 presidential campaign. From the far-left New York Times: [T]wo prominent women said they warned Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team. In 2016, Lena Dunham, the writer and actress, said she was troubled by the producer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visible presence during Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential run, hosting fund-raisers and appearing at campaign events. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just want you to let you know that Harvey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a rapist and this is going to come out at some point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Dunham said she told Kristina Schake, the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputy communications director. She recalled adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really bad idea for him to host fund-raisers and be involved because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an open secret in Hollywood that he has a problem with sexual assault.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Ms. Dunham said she also warned Adrienne Elrod, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton who was leading efforts with celebrity campaigners. As far as Ms. Dunham could tell, the campaign had not responded to her concerns about Mr. Weinstein. Weeks before Election Day, the producer helped organize a star-packed fund-raiser: an\u00c2\u00a0evening\u00c2\u00a0on Broadway with Julia Roberts, Anne Hathaway and others. But even without this reporting, what we also know is that Weinstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alleged misconduct and abuse were no secret in Hollywood and Washington, DC. Report after report after report confirm that \u00e2\u0080\u009ceveryone knew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but no one did anything because 1) Weinstein had the power to make or break your Hollywood career and 2) Weinstein raised a ton of money for Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u0094 most especially, the Clintons; most especially, Hillary Clinton. On top of that, at the time, it was no secret Farrow was working on what would be a Pulitzer-winning Weinstein expos\u00c3\u00a9. Everyone knew because Farrow was reaching out to everyone to put the story together. According to Farrow, Weinstein understood this report could completely destroy his life, career, and reputation (which it did), and so, the Oscar-winning producer went so far as to try to intimidate Farrow, using everything from spies to threats aimed at Farrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s employers at NBC News. Farrow says Weinstein told NBC he would expose the network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top star, Matt Lauer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00c2\u00a0meaning the alleged sexual misconduct that eventually unraveled the Today Show anchor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career. For the record, NBC News denies being threatened with Lauer. Nevertheless, NBC did refuse to run Farrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Weinstein story. Eventually, the far-left news outlet sent its own reporter and his bombshell story down the road to the New Yorker, where Farrow would not only win a Pulitzer, but launch the #MeToo movement that took down Lauer anyway. Anyway, this Hillary Clinton bombshell could not come at a worse time for the two-time presidential loser, a time when she appears to be seriously flirting with the idea of a 2020 rematch with President Trump. She might want to remember that during their 2016 battle, Trump was not afraid to remind voters that Hillary played a leading role to personally destroy the women who claimed to have been raped, abused, molested, and mistreated by her husband, former President Bill Clinton.

      "content": " A Morning Consult/Politico poll found that 50 percent of American voters reportedly support impeaching Trump. Forty-four percent of American voters said that they do not support an impeachment inquiry, while six percent do not know or have an opinion on the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 impeachment inquiry. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats favor House Democrats impeaching Trump and removing him from office. However, the survey reveals that Republicans and independents do not largely approve of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (D-CA) move to impeach the president. Eighty-three percent of Republican voters oppose impeachment and Senate removal of Trump, while 12 percent favor removing him from office, and five percent remain unsure about whether to impeach him. Republican voters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 strong support for Trump may make it harder for Democrats to successfully remove him from office through a Senate impeachment trial. Further, independent voters remain unsure over whether Congress should impeach Trump and remove him from office. Forty-three percent of independent voters approve of the House impeaching and the Senate removing him from office, while 43 percent oppose impeachment and removal from office, and 13 percent remain unsure whether to impeach Trump. Only Democrats voters said that having their representative back impeachment would make it more likely for them to vote for their reelection. Sixty-eight percent of Republicans said that their lawmaker backing impeachment would make it less likely for them to vote for their representative. Thirty-five percent of independents said that their lawmaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support for impeachment would make it more likely for them to back impeachment, while 32 percent said it would make it less likely, and 23 percent remain unsure whether their representative\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backing of impeachment would make it more likely for them to vote for their lawmaker. The poll comes after a survey conducted for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) found that 59 percent of voters in congressional swing districts do not view Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with Zelensky as an impeachable offense.

Wang was arrested shortly afterward and the case is being investigated, local police said in a statement. Wang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social media post was published Sunday, a few days after longtime Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey sent a tweet in support of months-long anti-government protests in Hong Kong. The Rockets have been arguably the most popular NBA franchise in China since the team drafted Chinese superstar Yao Ming in 2002. Yao played his entire NBA career in Houston. Morey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now deleted tweet angered both the NBA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chinese partners and U.S. politicians who accused the league of putting a priority on profit, instead of American values such as free speech. NBA commissioner Adam Silver released a statement on the controversy: \u00e2\u0080\u009cValues of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and will continue to do so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silver said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As CNN reports, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSilver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response drew the ire of Chinese authorities and many angry citizens who said they would no longer support the Rockets. Some said they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buy Rockets gear unless Morey resigned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In addition, several Chinese retailers and businesses have suspended ties to the Rockets, according to CNN. A photograph of Wang shows him wearing a mask and a patch over one eye \u00e2\u0080\u0094 symbols that have become synonymous with the ongoing Hong Kong uprising in support of democracy. Another photo shows him holding the Chinese flag and a lighter. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

The app, which Breitbart News reported recently was\u00c2\u00a0removed from the app store, was returned after a backlash from Apple customers and supporters of free speech, to the displeasure of the communist Chinese government.\n\nWhen the HKmap Live app was removed, Apple told the developers that:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour app contains content \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is not legal \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The company behind the Hong Kong app argued that other apps have taken exception to these rules as they simply provide location data, if these rules were to be applied universally location-based apps such as Waze would also be banned. Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument was that the app is used solely to track police activity and protest movements. Messages on the app read: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter the tear gas was applied, the police officer immediately returned to the police station.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another read: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFour flashing lights parked at the police station door.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Following backlash against the Silicon Valley giant, the decision was reversed several days later.

      "content": " Evers signed the measure at the Indian Community School in Franklin, Wisconsin, on Tuesday, WISN reported. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThrough this executive order, we recognize and appreciate our tribal nations and Indigenous people and their resilience, wisdom, and the contributions they make to our state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evers said of the signing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNative Americans in Wisconsin and throughout our country have suffered unjust treatment\u00e2\u0080\u0094often at the hands of our government\u00e2\u0080\u0094and today is about recognizing that Wisconsin would not be all that it is without Indigenous people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. Wisconsin houses 11 federally-recognized Native Nations, according to the executive order, which affirms their sovereignty and recognizes the \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificance\u00e2\u0080\u009d of indigenous people in the region. Although the declaration is of importance to the tribes in the area, some people have disagreed with the measure being scheduled on Columbus Day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political correctness run amok,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Milwaukee Alderman Bob Donovan said, adding that he thinks Columbus Day should be observed separately. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not at all opposed to recognizing Native Americans, indigenous peoples to the Americas. No problem whatsoever. But I do have a problem when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done at the expense of Christopher Columbus and Italians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Donovan said. Wisconsin is not the first state to enact an executive order recognizing Native Americans on the same day as Columbus Day. Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed legislation in April recognizing Columbus Day as \u00e2\u0080\u009cNative American Day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Hill reported.",

Ambassador Rodman\u00e2\u0080\u009d:  Rodman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plea follows days of controversy sparked by Rockets GM Daryl Morey, who tweeted support for Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pro-democracy movement last week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the now-deleted tweet read. As a result, the Chinese Basketball Association suspended its relationship with the Houston Rockets. While Morey followed up with a pair of apologetic tweets, the NBA ultimately\u00c2\u00a0sided with the Chinese government: We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together Rockets Owner Tilman Fertitta also pushed back on Morey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial remarks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cListen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fertitta wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization\u00e2\u0080\u009d:  ESPN followed suit, tap dancing around the issue in order to refrain from further escalating the tension between the two entities. As Breitbart News reported: According to a report from Deadspin, ESPN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Senior News Director Chuck Salituro sent a\u00c2\u00a0memo\u00c2\u00a0to all staffers telling them to avoid talking about the political situation between Hong Kong and mainland China. Deadspin was also told that senior ESPN executives were monitoring all shows as they discussed the news of the day. ESPN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reticence to talk about the massive and endemic human rights violations stands in stark contrast to the network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all-out support for the NBA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boycott of North Carolina because of the Tar Heel State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transgender bathroom law. It is not yet clear if Silver will respond to Rodman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request, but it is true that the former reality TV and NBA star has positioned himself as a diplomat in recent years. The White House reportedly thanked Rodman over the summer, specifically \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor his role in advocating for diplomacy between North Korea and the U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " The employee, Henry Kyle Frese, 30, possessed top-secret clearance at the DIA, and is alleged to have leaked\u00c2\u00a0classified information, including details of weapons systems, to two journalists in 2018 and 2019. According to the Department of Justice, Frese was seemingly involved in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cromantic relationship for some or all of that period of time\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which he allegedly transmitted the information. One of the reporters wrote at least eight articles using information from at least five intelligence reports, which were leaked by the DIA worker, according to the indictment. He reportedly even\u00c2\u00a0re-tweeted a link to one of the articles that the reporter wrote using the information he had given to her. In April 2018, after Frese accessed one of the intelligence reports, the reporter sent him a private message on Twitter asking if he would be willing to speak with another journalist, who worked at another outlet owned by the same company. Frese replied that he would help if it could help advance the first reporter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career because he wanted to see her \u00e2\u0080\u009cprogress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The government also intercepted a call in September during which Frese allegedly read classified national defense information to the second journalist, according to court documents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrese was caught red-handed disclosing sensitive national security information for personal gain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Demers, the\u00c2\u00a0Assistant Attorney General of the National Security Division. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe unauthorized disclosure of TOP SECRET information could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave harm to the national security of the United States,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Justice Department said in a press release. Frese is the sixth individual to be charged with leaking to reporters or the public in the last two years. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "author": "Alana Mastrangelo",
      "content": " \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe assistant dean sent out an email,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rice, \u00e2\u0080\u009c[which] stated TPUSA was a hate group, that we were linked with supremacy groups \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that we were definitely not allowed on campus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that we should not be tolerated, and that all students and students and faculty should push back against us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009c[The email] was received by all professors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all faculty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Rice, who added that at the end of the email, the assistant dean encouraged administrators to pass the propaganda along to their students as well. Listen below:  A section of the assistant dean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purported email reads as follows: Please warn your students that these hate groups are active. I also suggest that, when appropriate, you create meaningful dialogue around the subject in your classrooms. These can be difficult conversations, but we must be willing to engage in them. Moreover, we need to create discourses in our classrooms that can counter some of the false and misleading information students are receiving from some of these groups. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn October 7th, the local chapter of Turning Point USA will host the visit of Charlie Kirk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the email, claiming that Kirk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s group is linked to white supremacy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeveral colleagues in CLA [College of Liberal Arts] and other colleges are collaborating with student organizations that are planning an alternative event or teach-in on the same day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rice mentioned, however, that members of the campus community who were critical of TPUSA had never made an effort to speak with the conservative students, to find out what they really believe in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one ever talked to us, so they would never know who we are actually,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all have strong moral characters. This is why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so upsetting \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we all come from a good place in our hearts. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all very loving people, we genuinely love every single person.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd by promoting hate against us on campus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 through this email \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there was constantly always something around the corner. I would go to class, and there would be posters with our logo \u00e2\u0080\u0094[they] put, \u00e2\u0080\u0098UNR protects racists, conservative groups are a place for white supremacists,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stuff like this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was slander, everywhere I went, every single lecture hall, every building,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it is to be believed that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming down from the highest points of position in this university, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re encouraging students and teaching them that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay to silence conservatives on campus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One week before the Kirk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scheduled appearance at UNR, a leftist student approached a TPUSA recruiting table, where group members were promoting the upcoming event. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis individual came up to us, and he started acting aggressive, arguing with us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained Rice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt one point \u00e2\u0080\u0094 his body language was just very uneasy. We had valuables on the table \u00e2\u0080\u0094 my laptop and a portable speaker. We started taking those off the table, in fear that he might do something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the minute we took off our last valuable thing, the individual just came at us and flipped the table,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur table was destroyed, coffee went everywhere. I know coffee went all over our pants, and the individual just ended up running away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The incident was caught on video, and later posted to Kirk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter account.  According to the University of Nevada, Reno Police Department, the man \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas arrested for Destruction of Property and Disturbing the Peace. He was taken to the Washoe County Jail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI applaud our campus police for acting so quickly and diligently to hold this person accountable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut that was only our campus police, the university didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marlow mentioned that the left has changed the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhite supremacist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe definition of white supremacy used to be you actually had to think white people are superior to other races,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Marlow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow [the definition] is simply, you are a right-of-center person and you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate the president, even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a black person. Remember, Candace Owens is a \u00e2\u0080\u0098black white supremacist,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 according to the left.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rice added that despite all of the slander being directed toward her group, it did help with TPUSA recruitment, as students have witnessed first-hand the propaganda being promoted by the left, which in turn, has motivated conservative students to see to it that their voices are not silenced. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause colleges are controlled by leftist faculty and students, I initially thought there was going to be less conservative [students], but as I started getting out there and recruiting, there was a lot more than I thought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted Rice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany of them did not have a voice on our campus and were afraid to speak up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut by doing this event, it allowed me to recruit them on my team and help other conservatives that did not have a voice before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.",

      "content": " Speaking to the Parliament plenary session on Wednesday, the newly selected President of the European Parliament David Sassoli revealed that as well as meeting with Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday in London, he had also engaged in apparently secret talks with the notoriously anti-Brexit speaker of the Commons, John Bercow. Far from being a simple meeting of equivalent role-holders from two Parliaments, the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments made clear the two men had come to agreement on working together to stop a full Brexit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what he called a \u00e2\u0080\u009cchaotic exit\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Sassoli told the chamber: \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6This morning I also had a fruitful discussion with speaker Bercow in which I set out my view that any request by British institutions of an extension of prorogation of Parliament should allow the British people to give their views, be it in a referendum or a general election. Speaker Bercow and I were very much on the same wavelength regarding the importance of our respective Parliaments in managing Brexit.   \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe share an awareness that a chaotic exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union would work to the detriment of citizens on both sides, I do trust that no deal can be avoided at the end of the day. The European Union nonetheless has adopted all the necessary measures to prepare for the consequences should it occur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brexit leader Nigel Farage signalled his fury at this development, writing: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSassoli confirms a meeting with John Bercow in which they agreed to work to prevent a clean break Brexit. What right does the Speaker have to do this? Disgraceful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr Farage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments were followed up by Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice who questioned whether Sassoli even had the authority to enter into such talks, and by MEP Belinda de Lucy who directed her scorn directly at the chair in the session. She said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me make this very clear Mr Sassoli, you have no right to go and speak with the UK Speaker and have conversations that are directly interfering into our domestic politics. It exposes your intentions to intervene at all levels to stop Brexit. It is immoral; shame on you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons who as a convention of the house is allowed to retain his seat in parliament without actually having to fight any elections, has emerged since the 2016 Brexit referendum from his proper position as a neutral arbiter of Parliamentary business to a central figure in the anti-Brexit resistance. Such is his respect among anti-Brexit activists, he was last week named as a potential caretaker Prime Minister in an anti-Brexit coalition government, should that faction succeed in bringing down the Boris Johnson government.",

The party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leader Nigel Farage was the third-most trusted in that respect, with\u00c2\u00a029 per cent. The top five considered to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore on the side of the British Establishment\u00e2\u0080\u009d were: the Conservative Party (42 per cent), Prime Minister Boris Johnson (36 per cent), \u00e2\u0080\u009cMPs who want to remain in the EU\u00e2\u0080\u009d (35 per cent), judges (32 per cent), and\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cMPs who want to leave the EU without a deal\u00e2\u0080\u009d (31 per cent). The survey also found that trust in politicians and parties to put the nation first when it comes to Brexit is at a low of 17 per cent.  Despite the Brexit Party being the most trusted political party to represent the people, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has again ruled out an election pact with Mr Farage. Centrist Tory MP and Remainer Damian Green told The Guardian on Wednesday that Johnson said he would not go into a pact with the Brexit Party. He also claimed the prime minister said he would not make leaving the EU in a clean-break a manifesto pledge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe went in to say that no deal as the prime aim of government policy would be unacceptable in a manifesto and we were reassured that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the prime minister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aim, that he still wants to get a deal now and still thinks that would be the best outcome. He has no intention of putting a no-deal policy in a manifesto,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr Green said. Last month, Mr Farage announced that he would run as a parliamentary candidate in the next General Election. The Brexit Party leader says that the prime minister would need a strategic election pact to win a substantial majority for Brexit. Mr Farage predicted such a partnership could lead to up to a 100-seat majority. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is a way for Boris to get a big, workable majority. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy to help with that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr Farage said in late September. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the party that believes in a clean-break Brexit because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only way that we can honour the referendum, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said that if Boris Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s party goes for a clean-break then, of course, we ought to have a non-aggression pact.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": " The House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 campaign wing reported $27.4 million in the third quarter, just $2.1 million more than Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who raised more than any other Democrat candidate in the third quarter. While the DCCC, which experienced a mass exodus of staffers over diversity-related concerns during the summer, sees the haul as a positive, it is $1.6 million short of the $29 million it raised in the second quarter. According to the DCCC just over half \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $14 million \u00e2\u0080\u0093 came from small donors. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow more than ever, we must work to protect and expand our fragile House Majority,\u00e2\u0080\u009d DCCC chairwoman\u00c2\u00a0Cheri Bustos\u00c2\u00a0(D-IL) stated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat means keeping up our record-setting pace, continuing our work to engage with a broad coalition of voters across this country, and fighting for the common sense priorities of the American people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe stakes have never been higher and we will not let up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. The DCCC hopes the haul will assist the Democrats in maintaining control of the House in 2020. As Breitbart News reported, the impeachment inquiry leaves many Democrats in key congressional districts vulnerable. Internal polling signals an uphill battle for impeachment-driven Democrats, showing that voters are more likely to support a Republican candidate over an impeachment-supporting Democrat. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) poll ultimately found that 59 percent do not view President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky an impeachable offense. As Breitbart News reported: Fifty-four percent of voters in those Trump-won, Democrat-held districts said they would be more willing to vote for a Republican. Only 38 percent chose a Democrat, giving Republicans a 16-point advantage. Additionally, the majority of voters in these districts \u00e2\u0080\u0093 58 percent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 say Democrats have not accomplished much since taking the House, and 62 percent believe that the impeachment inquiry will continue to distract them from achieving promised policy goals. The Trump campaign and Republican National Committee (RNC) have experienced a financial boost following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (D-CA) formal announcement of an impeachment inquiry, raising a combined $5 million in the 24 hours following her announcement and a total of $13 million in the three-day span following her pledge: Voters vote with their wallets\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and we are winning! You can not FAKE NEWS THAT. https://t.co/Ze29Iu0XTh \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Brad Parscale (@parscale) September 25, 2019  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf this week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GOP fundraising haul is any indication, Pelosi didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just drive another nail into the coffin awaiting the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nominee next year, she may also be looking at serious losses in the swing House districts that handed her the speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gavel in 2018,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote. Additionally, the RNC and Trump campaign announced a massive $125 million fundraising haul in the third quarter, further signaling that impeachment-driven Democrats have cause for concern.",

      "content": " On Wednesday, 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden at a town hall in Rochester, NH called for President Donald Trump to be impeached. CNN was there with cameras to capture the moment. Biden said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith his words and his actions, President Trump has indicted himself by obstructing justice, refusing to comply with the congressional inquiry. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also convicted himself in full view of the world and the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know to preserve our constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity. He should be impeached. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not only because of what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done. To answer whether he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s committed acts sufficient to warrant impeachment is obvious. We see it in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own words. We see it in the texts from state department officials that have been made public. We see it in his pulling much of the United States government into his corrupt schemes, individuals within the government, his appointees. But we have to remember that impeachment isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t only about what the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the threat the president poses to the nation if allowed to remain in office. One thing about this president is absolutely clear, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think anyone can contradict this, he has seen no limits to his power regardless of what the Constitution says.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe believes the entire United States government can be corrupted into furthering his personal political needs. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even willing to hold Congress and congressionally appropriated aid to a foreign nation hostage to his personal political demands. He believes if he does something, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal, period. And perhaps most importantly, he believes there is nothing we can do about it. He believes he can and will get away with anything he does. We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no joke. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we can not let him get away with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

      "subtitle": "House Democrat leaders on Tuesday subpoenaed Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, to testify at a deposition and hand over documents related to their impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " The subpoena came hours after the Trump administration ordered Sondland not to appear before a scheduled deposition with the Democrat-led panels conducting the impeachment inquiry. The Associated Press reports: House Democrats have subpoenaed Gordon Sondland, the U.S. European Union ambassador, after he failed to show up at a scheduled closed-door deposition Tuesday morning. The deposition was scheduled as part of House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Ukraine. Sondland was an intermediary as Trump appealed to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his family. Three House committees are demanding that Sondland appear at a deposition Oct. 16. They are also demanding that he produce documents, including communications from his personal device that have been turned over to the State Department but not to Congress. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, deemed the decision to prevent Sondland from testifying as \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong evidence of obstruction\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Trump. In a statement, Jim McDermott, Sondland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney, explained: Ambassador Sondland had previously agreed to appear voluntarily today, without the need for a subpoena, in order to answer the committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questions on an expedited basis. As the sitting U.S. Ambassador to the EU and employee of the State Department, Ambassador Sondland is required to follow the department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction. Sondland was \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofoundly disappointed\u00e2\u0080\u009d he was unable to testify Tuesday but is willing to appear on short notice if permitted by the Trump administration, his lawyer added. The Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are leading the impeachment probe. In a joint statement issued Tuesday, the chairmen of the House panels vowed to subpoena Sondland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will be issuing subpoena to Ambassador Sondland for both his testimony and documents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they declared. A July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky ultimately triggered the impeachment probe. An intelligence community \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d filed a complaint alleging Trump pressured Zelensky on the phone call to investigate allegations of corruption against Joe Biden and his son. Trump threatened to withhold aid if Ukraine did not play ball, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d claimed. Sondland has contradicted the quid pro quo claim at the center of the impeachment inquiry. In a text message, the top diplomat clearly said there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cno quid pro quo of any kind\u00e2\u0080\u009d between Trump and Zelensky. Last week, former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker provided a series of texts to the House committees. In written testimony, Volker described the communication exchanges as evidence that the Trump administration did not bully Ukraine into investigating Biden or his son. House Democrats, nevertheless, leaked a \u00e2\u0080\u009csubset\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the texts to fuel their impeachment effort. The Democrats used the texts to argue the complete opposite of what Volker testified, saying the communication exchange proves Trump made a quid pro quo offer. Republicans are calling on the House Democrats to release the full transcript of Volker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony. On Tuesday, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) said making the transcript public would \u00e2\u0080\u009cexonerate\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump. Meadows witnessed the more than eight hours of testimony provided by Volker. The impeachment inquiry proceedings are akin to a \u00e2\u0080\u009ckangaroo court\u00e2\u0080\u009d led by House Democrats who have cherry-picked and mischaracterized evidence, Republican congressmen argued Tuesday. Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, noted that the proceedings fall outside the recognized standards of previous impeachment efforts. House Democrats subpoenaed Sondland on the heels of a White House letter to House Democrats announcing that Trump would not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. Trump and members of his administration \u00e2\u0080\u009ccannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances,\u00e2\u0080\u009d White House Counsel Pat Cipollone declared in the letter. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said he understands the White House decision not to allow Sondland to testify. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reason why the State Department decided not to have Amb. Sondland here today is based on the unfair and partisan process that Mr. Schiff has been running,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told reporters Tuesday. The White House letter said the impeachment probe is akin to an effort \u00e2\u0080\u009cseeking to overturn the results of the 2016 election.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Tom Ciccotta",
      "content": " According to a local news report, Sen. Josh Hawley is continuing his call for a federal investigation into China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s influence on American college campuses. Hawley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerns center on an education group called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cConfucius Institute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Chinese-government agency that has built partnerships with American colleges and universities. The Confucius Institute is steeped in controversy. Critics have accused the organization, and by extension, the Chinese government, of seeking control over messaging at American universities. June Tuefel Dreyer, a professor at the University of Miami, claimed that the Confucius Institute told them that they are not allowed to discuss the Dalai Lama, Tibet, Taiwan, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military. Martin Davidson, chief executive of the British Council, told the\u00c2\u00a0New York Times in 2012 that the Confucius Institute bribes colleges with funding in exchange for control over the campus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 discourse on China. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Chinese are very clear on what they are trying to achieve,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Davidson said at the time. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want to change the perception of China \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to combat negative propaganda with positive propaganda. And they use the word \u00e2\u0080\u0098propaganda\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in Chinese. But I doubt they have to say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only give you this money if you never criticize China.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The danger is more of self-censorship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is a very subtle thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a letter to leaders at the University of Missouri and Webster University, Sen. Hawley argued that it is inappropriate for do business with an organization would ask them to censor speech. But Confucius Institutes are more than a means of cultural exchange. As Li Changchun, a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party, stated in 2009, the Confucius Institutes are \u00e2\u0080\u0098an important part of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overseas propaganda set-up.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Hanban is governed by the leaders of twelve Chinese ministries, including those handling foreign affairs, state media, and propaganda. Partnering universities sign contracts that prohibit them from \u00e2\u0080\u0098tarnishing the reputation\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of Hanban, and Hanban sends teachers and textbooks from China that are designed to promote a positive image of the PRC and suppress any discussion of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098three Ts\u00e2\u0080\u0099: Tibet, Taiwan, and Tiananmen Square. These Confucius Institutes are, in short, a tool for China to spread influence and exercise soft power in its rivalry with the United States.

The development follows reports of the former House Oversight Committee chairman joining President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal team in the battle against the House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 partisan-fueled impeachment efforts. While initially speculatory, the New York Post reports that Gowdy signed on as part of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outside legal counsel. Gowdy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s addition follows a series of back-and-forth between the White House and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). The White House sent a letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 penned by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to the speaker, informing her that the executive branch will not comply with the impeachment probe, arguing that the inquiry itself lacks \u00e2\u0080\u009cany legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause participating in this inquiry under the current unconstitutional posture would inflict lasting institutional harm on the Executive Branch and lasting damage to the separation of powers, you have left the President no choice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter read. \u00e2\u0080\u009cConsistent with the duties of the President of the United States, and in particular his obligation to preserve the rights of future occupants of his office, President Trump cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it added. Pelosi responded, calling the letter \u00e2\u0080\u009cmanifestly wrong\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009canother unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespite the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stonewalling, we see a growing body of evidence that shows that President Trump abused his office and violated his oath to \u00e2\u0080\u0098protect, preserve and defend the Constitution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she claimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the speaker added. Internal polling suggests that pursuing impeachment will hurt Democrats in vulnerable congressional districts, as the majority of voters in those districts do not view Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conversation with Ukrainian President\u00c2\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky an\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeachable offense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite that, Democrats in the House are largely using the conversation as a basis for the impeachment inquiry.",

      "author": "",
      "content": "The revelation came a day after the Washington Examiner reported that the intelligence community (IC) inspector general (IG) told congressional investigators the first \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d had a previous \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofessional relationship\u00e2\u0080\u009d with an unnamed 2020 Democrat candidate. News reports have also identified the original \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cregistered Democrat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Moreover, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d reportedly shared his complaint with the Democrat-led House Intelligence Committee before reaching out to the IC IG, a move that suggests he violated the law. Two \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblowers\u00e2\u0080\u009d have surfaced accusing President Donald Trump of coercing Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Bide and his son, Hunter, by threatening to withhold aid. The first \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a member of the intelligence community. The same lawyers represent both leakers. Citing the attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biography published by his current employer, the Federalist revealed that the lawyer used to report directly to Clapper, adding: Charles McCullough, an attorney now representing the whistleblowers with Andrew Bakaj, a former staffer for Sens. Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton, was previously the inspector general of the intelligence community (ICIG) at the height of the Clinton email scandal. Now a partner at the Compass Rose Legal Group, McCullough\u00e2\u0080\u0099s professional biography on the law firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website notes that he reported directly to Clapper as ICIG and \u00e2\u0080\u009coversaw intelligence officers responsible for audits, inspections, investigations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Clapper, who joined CNN as a national security analyst after leaving government in 2017, was a central figure in perpetuating the Russia hoax against Trump and lied to Congress about mass surveillance on Americans. In an interview with Fox 5 last December, McCullough commended the former DNI, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI enjoyed a very good relationship with Jim Clapper, we got along fabulously.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Clapper is a retired lieutenant general in the U.S. Air Force. The former intelligence community chief\u00c2\u00a0is one of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fiercest critics. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblowers\u00e2\u0080\u009d claim that Trump threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine if it refused to investigate corruption allegations against Biden, and his son is at the center of the impeachment probe. According to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblowers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump made the so-called quid pro quo offer during a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. However, both Trump and Zelensky have denied the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblowers\u00e2\u0080\u009d characterization of their conversation. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, has also said there was not quid pro quo during the call. Michael Atkinson, the IC IG, noted in an August 26 letter that the first \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d was found to have harbored \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical bias\u00e2\u0080\u009d in favor of a rival political candidate to President Trump. Atkinson did not name the rival.  CNN contributor Clapper served as former U.S. President Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DNI from August 9, 2010, to January 20, 2017, when Donald Trump took office. On Wednesday, the Federalist linked one of the lawyers representing the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblowers\u00e2\u0080\u009d to Clapper.",

One event on Facebook, titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cProtest: Say NO to Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d claims the pair\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance is an \u00e2\u0080\u009cinsult to the multicultural organizations that have had their funds stripped away from them by Student Government.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cJoin us at 5:30 PM outside the venue as we #ChompTrump and send a clear message to the Trumps that hatred and bigotry are not welcome on our campus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s description reads. Over 400 people marked that they are going to the protest, which begins at 5:30 p.m. EST. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do NOT support the usage of our student fees to fund a Trump campaign event on OUR campus and further promote the hateful rhetoric of this Administration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one of the posts on the event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s page reads. \u00e2\u0080\u009c#CHOMPTRUMP.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cStudent fees should NOT be used to fund this toxic event,\u00e2\u0080\u009d another post on the page adds. Another group, No Nazis at UF, is demanding UF to cancel the event altogether.  The group is expected to hold its protest in the Turlington Plaza at 5 p.m. EST.  The group also advertised its Wednesday night event of Anti-Don Jr. Sign-Making in anticipation of his Thursday evening appearance.  Despite the protesters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 accusations of a lack of diversity in ACCENT speakers, ACCENT has extended invitations to 33 speakers over the last four years. Of those, \u00e2\u0080\u009csix have been women and 11 have been people of color,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gainesville reported.",

      "author": "John Carney",
      "content": " China has sent signals this week that it would accept a smaller trade deal that would involve the U.S. holding off on new tariffs in exchange for purchases of U.S. agricultural goods. On Wednesday afternoon, Reuters reported that China had \u00e2\u0080\u009clowered its expectations\u00e2\u0080\u009d for progress on trade talks in reaction to the Commerce Department blacklisting dozens of Chinese tech companies over human rights violations. Speaking to the press on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he was not lowering his own expectations for the talks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m driving a tough deal because I have to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI told that to President Xi. I said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098This can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be like a 5o-50 deal. If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 50-50 deal, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re up here and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re down here. If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 50-50 deal, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work. This has to be a better deal from our standpoint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Midlevel officials from the Trump administration and China have been meeting last week and this week to set the stage for the high-level meetings set to begin on Wednesday. But few in the Trump administration are expecting a break-through, according to sources close to the talks who spoke with Breitbart News . There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some concern that the talks could go awry, breaking-off early if China plays hardball. That is what happened in Shanghai this summer when U.S. officials quickly realized that the talks were not going to be productive. After U.S. officials debriefed the president on the talks, President Trump quickly announced a new round of tariff hikes. It was hoped early on that more time and higher tariffs would convince China to come to the next round of negotiations with a more open attitude toward the reforms with regard to forced technology transfer and industrial policy that the U.S. has demanded from the start of the trade fight last year. Those hopes have largely faded over the past two weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. An agreement is still possible, according to people involved in the talks. But it largely depends on what China is willing to negotiate when high-level talks begin Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt all depends on whether China is willing to make a deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an official said, echoing the words of President Trump from earlier this week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot many of us are confident they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re there yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

Warren refused to answer the question directly, calling it \u00e2\u0080\u009ca little premature\u00e2\u0080\u009d and essentially leaving the door open for her potential running mate to attend high-dollar fundraisers, which she prides herself on avoiding. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little premature to be talking about vice presidential. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still in primary here, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m working hard on this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. But look, I want a vice presidential partner, someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to get out there and fight for the same values,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added:  Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claims of a 100 percent grassroots-funded campaign have been called into question, particularly following a report that indicated she used millions in leftover funds \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $10.4 million \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from her 2018 senatorial bid to cushion her presidential campaign. At the time, Warren happily courted big donors and attended fundraisers, causing some to question her commitment to a true grassroots operation. Former\u00c2\u00a0Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell (D) contributed $4,000 to Warren in 2018 and noted her sudden change of heart. As Breitbart News reported: Rendell cohosted a Biden fundraiser earlier this year. To his surprise, the Warren campaign slammed the event as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca swanky private fund-raiser for wealthy donors\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 despite the fact that Warren benefitted from similar events in the recent past. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any trouble taking our money the year before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rendell said, according to the Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of a sudden, we were bad guys and power brokers and influence-peddlers. In 2018, we were wonderful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren also attended fundraisers hosted by billionaires\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0specifically Henry and Marsha Laufer. As the New York Times reported: In Florida, she was hosted for an event by the billionaires Henry and Marsha Laufer. In New York, Meyer S. Frucher, the vice chairman of Nasdaq,\u00c2\u00a0held a reception for her. She was hosted by the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLost\u00e2\u0080\u009d creator Damon Lindelof and his wife, Heidi, in Southern California. The philanthropist Stephen M. Silberstein had Ms. Warren over to his San Francisco-area home. And as late as the fall of 2018, she visited Silicon Valley, where Karla Jurvetson, a multimillion-dollar Democratic contributor, hosted an event for her. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign reported $24.6 million raised in the third quarter, less than $1 million short of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (I-VT) $25.3 million. Approximately 940,000 contributions comprised the third-quarter haul, having an average donation of $26.",

Planned Parenthood recently opted out of the federal Title X family planning funding when the Trump administration decided to enforce the rule that recipients of funds from the program cannot perform or refer for abortions. About $60 million in funding that had been granted to Planned Parenthood through Title X in the past was then redirected to comprehensive healthcare providers that do not perform abortions. Nevertheless, Planned Parenthood still receives over $500 million annually in taxpayer funding through Medicaid reimbursements.",

      "subtitle": "A dozen Democrats in the House are calling for U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland to step down amid the unfolding impeachment inquiry scandal linked to Ukraine.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " The call came before House leaders subpoenaed Sondland after President Donald Trump blocked him from testifying at a deposition related to the impeachment probe that lawmakers had scheduled for Tuesday. Echoing some Republican lawmakers, Trump argued\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0the impeachment proceedings are illegitimate and akin to a \u00e2\u0080\u009ckangaroo court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sondland was expected to testify Tuesday before the Democrat-led panels pursuing the impeachment inquiry. The House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are leading the investigation. Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, described Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move to prevent Sondland from testifying as \u00e2\u0080\u009cobstruction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d NBC News surveyed all 235 Democrat members of the House about whether or nor Sondland should resign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany of the lawmakers said they were withholding judgment until Sondland testifies Tuesday and urged him to fully cooperate with the committees, warning that failure to do so would amount to obstruction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d NBC News noted. Overall, 12 members of the House Democratic Caucus called for Sondland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resignation. More House Democrats likely came out in support of Sondland stepping down after he opted not to testify. NBC News identified the Democrat representatives calling for Sondland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resignation as Reps. Tim Ryan (OH), Lloyd Doggett (TX), Gerry Connolly (VA), Bennie Thompson (MS), Denny Heck (WA), Filemon Vela (TX), David Price (NC), Bonnie Watson Coleman (N.J), Anthony Brown (MD), Dwight Evans (PA), Julia Brownley (CA) and Gwen Moore (WI). On September 27, U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker resigned from his post amid the impeachment inquiry. This week, Volker also stepped down as the executive director of the McCain Institute. Sondland and Volker got caught in the middle of the ongoing impeachment investigation. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d report that triggered the impeachment inquiry mentions Sondland, saying he tried to help urge Ukraine to investigate Biden. Both Volker and Sondland played a role in getting Ukraine to help with probes into corruption allegations linked to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Volker explained to House leaders they were pushing Ukraine to investigate domestic energy company Burisma Holdings, not Biden. \u00e2\u0080\u009c[A]t no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Volker said. His comments came in the form of written testimony prepared for his deposition last week. As vice president, Biden pushed Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in 2016, who was investigating the owner of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky. At the time, Hunter was serving on the board of Burisma, prompting allegations of corruption. Volker and Sondland also sought Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help in investigating the Russian collusion hoax. Sondland said in a text message that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cno quid pro quo of any kind\u00e2\u0080\u009d between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The text message contradicts the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d complaint that Trump threatened to withhold aid if Ukraine refused to investigate Biden and his son. Volker provided a series of text messages to congressional investigators. He described the communication exchange as evidence that the Trump administration did not coerce Ukraine into investigating the Bidens in exchange for aid, the claim behind the impeachment inquiry. Nevertheless, the Democrats released what they described as a \u00e2\u0080\u009csubset\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the texts, arguing the complete opposite, saying Volker and Sondland helped bully Ukraine.",

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, threatened to call Volker to testify before his panel if Democrats did not meet his demand. Volker is at the center of the impeachment investigation. He resigned as the special envoy to Ukraine at the end of last month as the inquiry began to heat up. Sen. Graham described the House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 refusal to make the full transcript of Volker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deposition last Thursday public as \u00e2\u0080\u009can abuse of power.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and other Republican congressmen who witnessed Volker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony have called on Democrats to release the transcript. Jordan is the top Republican of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. The Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are pursuing the impeachment inquiry. Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) said the full transcript of Volker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony \u00e2\u0080\u009cobliterated\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d claim fueling the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The comments from Zeldin, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee who also witnessed Volker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony, came while he was briefing reporters alongside Jordan. Citing a Fox News story highlighting the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 refusal to releae the transcript, Sen. Graham wrote on Twitter Wednesday, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf this continues, I will call Volker before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify publicly to ensure the full story is told.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf House [Democrats] refuse to release full transcript of Volker testimony as requested by Congressman Jordan, it will be an abuse of power,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added in a separate tweet.  An intelligence community \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d alleged that Trump attempted to coerce Ukraine into investigating White House Democrat hopeful Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. During a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump threatened to withhold aid if Ukraine failed to play ball, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d claimed. Trump and Zelensky have denied the allegation. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, told reporters Wednesday the release of the transcript would have already \u00e2\u0080\u009cexonerated\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump of any wrongdoing. Meadows was also present during the former envoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deposition. Rep. Zeldin added on Twitter last Friday: House [Democrats] should immediately release [Amb.] Volker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s several hours long transcribed interview so all can read it. He candidly [and] professionally obliterated the bogus charge POTUS made a quid pro quo offer to Zelensky connecting aid to Ukraine with an investigation into Bidens. Breitbart News corroborated Republican assertions that House Democrats cherry-picked and mischaracterized evidence provided by Volker to fuel their impeachment agenda. Volker also stepped down as the executive director of the McCain Institute this week.",

      "content": " Josephson, a psychiatrist and professor who led the child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Louisville School, lost his job after speaking at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC, in 2017 about treating children and teens for gender dysphoria. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI found my university turning against me for asking that question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Josephson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd some of my colleagues turned against me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithin weeks my university demoted me despite numerous evaluations from administrators praising my skills and what I had done in my career\u00c2\u00a0and my professionalism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Josephson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the next year I endured a hostile environment and then finally I was effectively fired all for simply asking a question \u00e2\u0080\u0094 why is this happening?\u00e2\u0080\u009d As Josephson spoke, a woman with a megaphone tried to drown him out by shouting repeatedly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo home homophobe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cTolerance is very popular these days especially among people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show much of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Josephson said. During his remarks, Josephson said gender dysphoria is real and damaging. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany of these children have serious distress, anxiety, depression, and they asked me what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best way to treat them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Josephson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a physician who cares about their patients my answer was straightforward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe best treatment is always based on the understanding of what is causing the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Josephson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does the confusion stem from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it a physical problem or is it an emotional problem?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Josephson said.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a behavioral scientist I could not bring myself to say this is just something that happens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do not approach any other medical condition that way, and we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to approach this one that way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Josephson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to understand a condition before we plan treatment for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I soon found out that \u00e2\u0080\u0098why\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is not a question a doctor can asked these days at least when it comes to gender dysphoria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Josephson said. The Heritage Foundation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daily Signal\u00c2\u00a0reported that Josephson said academia is failing in its purpose of educating students. Josephson said in the Daily Signal report: Universities are supposed to be places where you can exchange ideas and vigorous discussion, go back and forth. This marketplace of ideas as a metaphor is great, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how science proceeds. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we make progress. Unfortunately, many academic settings, including my own, are becoming more of an activist setting\u00e2\u0080\u0094meaning you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not testing ideas, promoting the results of research; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re asking for someone to agree with you, essentially. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJosephson cautioned that universities need to stop being about groupthink and instead embrace debate and differences of opinion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Daily Signal reported. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social activism is overriding academic inquiry and the search for truth and worst of all its overriding the well being of many patients,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Josephson said on the steps of the High Court, where several women held signs to support him that read \u00e2\u0080\u009cProtect Fairness for Women\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009c#SexNotGender.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Josephson warned Supreme Court justices of the gravity of their decision in three cases, one by a man who was fired from his job at a funeral home when he told his boss he was going to change his name and dress as a woman and two others by homosexual men who said they were fired because of their sexual orientation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the Supreme Court reads gender identity into federal law, a lot of people will be silenced or punished for their views,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Josephson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m living proof of that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These cases are Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia, No. 17-1618; Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, No. 17-1623; and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC, No. 18-107 in the Supreme Court of the United States.

However, the\u00c2\u00a0New York Times\u00e2\u0080\u0098 Nicholas Fandos also reported Tuesday that there remains a third reason that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower identified\u00e2\u0080\u009d that could \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe used to accuse him of potential bias against Mr. Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson suggested in his initial review of the complaint that there are some indications of \u00e2\u0080\u009can arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The third indication remains a secret to the public; however, the others, like his party affiliation and history with a presidential candidate, could shed light on the intelligence officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motivations to submit a whistleblower complaint regarding President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower,\u00e2\u0080\u009d released a statement Wednesday attempting to dispel accusations of the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alleged political bias against the president. Zaid said that these accusations of political bias had been used to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmischaracterize\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdetract\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the \u00e2\u0080\u009csubstance of the complaint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Further, Zaid said the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower is not the story\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cidentity of the whistleblower is irrelevant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Prominent Republicans across the political spectrum have argued that the public should know the identity of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his complaint that pushed Democrats to move towards an impeachment inquiry of President Trump. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said last week that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d should \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome forward\u00e2\u0080\u009d given the fallout of his or her complaint. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUltimately, if someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to accuse you of something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to bring down a presidency, I think we deserve to know who that person is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sen. Paul said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think there are reasons to have whistleblower statutes, and have anonymity. But if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re accusing somebody of something with the ramifications of impeachment, I think really the person ought to come forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) contended that the whistleblowers should be interviewed under oath. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen: if the whistleblowers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 allegations are turned into an impeachment article it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imperative that the whistleblower be interviewed in public, under oath, and cross-examined,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Graham said Sunday. Graham added that if this does not happen in the House,\u00e2\u0080\u009dI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make sure it happens in the Senate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Trump tweeted last week, asking why the country is not \u00e2\u0080\u009centitled\u00e2\u0080\u009d to learn everything about the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all of the false information to him.

      "subtitle": "President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration deported more than 2,500 illegal aliens in the last two months who had arrived at the United States-Mexico border and claimed to be part of a family unit.",
      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " Federal data obtained by Breitbart News reveals that since August, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has deported more than 2,500 illegal aliens who arrived as a family unit at the southern border and have final orders for removal. Over these two months, ICE agents arrested another 275 illegal aliens who arrived as family units at the border. All of these illegal aliens arrested have final orders for removal, meaning they have gone through the asylum and immigration courts and have been found not to be eligible to stay in the U.S. Compare these deportation numbers to that of Fiscal Year 2018, when\u00c2\u00a0ICE deported 2,711 illegal aliens who arrived as family units at the border for the entire year. This indicates that about 226 illegal aliens claiming to be part of a family unit were deported every month last year compared to about 1,250 deported each month in August and September of this year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a more than 453 percent increase in illegal family unit deportations based on monthly totals. As Breitbart News has reported, research finds that deporting the 11 to 22 million illegal aliens saves American taxpayers billions compared to the costs they are forced to pay when illegal aliens are allowed to stay. Deporting every illegal alien in the country would amount to a cost savings of about $622 billion over the course of a lifetime. This indicates that deporting illegal aliens is six times less costly than what it costs American taxpayers to currently subsidize the millions of illegal aliens living in the U.S. Mass deportations are supported by a majority of American voters, a July Harvard/Harris Poll finds. Overall, 51 percent of voters said they support mass deportations of the illegal alien population, including more than eight-in-ten GOP voters and more than five-in-ten swing voters.

ISIS terrorists, Trump said, would flee from capture to Europe rather than the U.S., saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where they want to go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as European Union bureaucrats have made mass migration readily available to migrants from across the Middle East and North Africa. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, [ISIS terrorists] are going to be escaping to Europe; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where they want to go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want to go back to their homes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Europe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want them for months. They could have had trials; they could have done whatever they wanted, but as usual, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not reciprocal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know my favorite word, reciprocal.

For national security purposes, Trump has fought against a Republican and Democrat political establishment and reduced refugee resettlement to the U.S. to its lowest levels since 1980. For Fiscal Year 2020, Trump will cut former President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refugee inflow by at least 80 percent by reducing the annual refugee resettlement ceiling to 18,000 admissions.\u00c2\u00a0This is merely a numerical limit and not a goal federal officials are supposed to reach. The U.S. has permanently resettled more than\u00c2\u00a01.7 million\u00c2\u00a0foreign nationals and refugees through a variety of humanitarian programs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a foreign population larger than the size of Philadelphia, which has 1.5 million residents.

The Freedom Caucus contended that Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interactions with the whistleblower could make him a possible \u00e2\u0080\u009cfact witness\u00e2\u0080\u009d in an impeachment inquiry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor over two years, Adam Schiff misled the American people with his numerous attempts to manufacture evidence of collusion between Donald Trump and the Russian government,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chairman Biggs said in a statement Wednesday, adding: Once that fairytale evaporated, Mr. Schiff quickly moved on to his next hoax: a non-existent quid pro quo between President Trump and the President of Ukraine. This time, just like the Russian hoax, Mr. Schiff has been caught manipulating facts leading to baseless accusations against the President. Mr. Schiff is hardly an unbiased arbiter of this unauthorized impeachment process, and we call for his immediate recusal. Reports have revealed that the intelligence officer whistleblower communicated with the House Intelligence Committee staff, and that information was relayed to Schiff. The House Freedom Caucus said that Congress should require Schiff to answer questions about his communications with the whistleblower. The conservatives wrote to Pelosi: The public knows little else about Chairman Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with the whistleblower because Chairman Schiff has failed to disclose the interaction. When asked directly whether the committee had any contact with the whistleblower, Chairman Schiff lied and said no. In light of this, Chairman Schiff must be required to answer questions about his interactions with the whistleblower under oath, as he has proven that he cannot be trusted to be honest otherwise. In 2017, you and your colleagues, including Chairman Schiff, demanded the recusal of then-Chairman Nunes from the Russia investigation because he allegedly met privately with a source to review sensitive information, without disclosing the meeting or the information to the committee. In keeping with past precedent, principles of fairness demand that you request the recusal of Chairman Schiff under these similar circumstances. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe urge you to give this matter your immediate attention.

      "content": " McClatchy, the newspaper chain and media conglomerate, has been caught deliberately printing easy-to-prove-false fake news regarding a key GOP congressman at the center of the hoax investigations Democrats are using to target President Donald Trump, then turning around and using said false reports to financially boost the company amid serious concerns about the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s falling stock price. McClatchy has seen a significant drop in stock price over the past several years, especially this year.\u00c2\u00a0 According to investment analyst service Morning Star, it is down to $2.78 per share at the close of business on Wednesday afternoon. McClatchy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock opened the year in the mid-$7 per share range but has slowly but surely slid down now near its all-time-low\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was trading at a slightly lower-per-share amount back in May than it is now. Poynter wrote in a 2018 piece about the newspaper company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s woes: For more than a decade, the McClatchy family has resolutely kept the newspaper company bearing its name afloat and independent despite a crushing debt load. The tough financial hand McClatchy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s board and executives have been dealt is getting even tougher with a terrible year for the industry unfolding and another expected in 2019. McClatchy stock has lost almost all its value to investors. Its market capitalization (the number of shares multiplied by share price) sits at $69 million, lowest of the seven public newspaper companies. At the same time, refinancing of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $794 million debt earlier this year consolidated more lending control in the hands of a longtime creditor, the private Chatham Asset Management hedge fund. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only gotten worse for McClatchy since that piece a little over a year ago in Poynter. McClatchy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial outlook is now so bad that the company received a warning in September of this year from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that it will be delisted if it does not get its act together financially, with the NYSE giving McClatchy 18 months to come into compliance with its standards, otherwise it will lose its listing. As the company races to raise revenues to save its 29 daily newspapers in 14 states, including perhaps most notably the Fresno Bee in California, the company has shifted business strategy to incorporating nonprofit and foundation funding of issues-based coverage into its model. A\u00c2\u00a0Digiday report noted that despite an increase in digital subscribers in the last quarter, McClatchy reported astonishing losses of $17.5 million in one quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0094against revenues of just $178.7 million. Lauren Gustus, a McClatchy editor in the western part of the United States intricately involved in the process, describes the effort the Fresno Bee is at the center\u00e2\u0080\u0094in quotes to Digiday as designed to create financial sustainability for McClatchy amid the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret that most legacy news organizations have been challenged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gustus said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf fact-based journalism is in peril, which I believe it is, we have to think pretty radically about how we serve our communities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is meant to be a bridge to sustainability and not necessarily the establishment of a nonprofit news operation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gustus added in a later quote. This is where things get interesting. In a separate interview with Nieman Labs, a Harvard-connected media blog, Gustus says that the Fresno Bee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coverage of Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA)\u00e2\u0080\u0094the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI)\u00e2\u0080\u0094has driven interest to this gambit that Gustus has described as one designed to financially save McClatchy as a company. She also says that the newspaper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent coverage of Nunes \u00e2\u0080\u009creframes our relationship with the community.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are many people who read about The Fresno Bee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coverage of Devin Nunes and wanted to help,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gustus said in the Nieman Labs interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPreviously we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have an outlet for those people. Now we do. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it reframes our relationship with the community.\u00e2\u0080\u009d According to that Nieman Labs report published on Oct. 1 where Gustus is quoted saying that the Fresno Bee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coverage of Nunes has driven investment into the newspaper chain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new financial initiatives, the newspaper has already raised $246,000 of its $600,000 goal to get the pilot program off the ground. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Bee has already raised $246,000, from the Central Valley Community Foundation, Fresno State, the California Endowment, and various wealthy Fresno folks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nieman Labs wrote. Nunes has had a longstanding battle with the Fresno Bee\u00e2\u0080\u0094he is actively suing the newspaper\u00e2\u0080\u0094something somewhat abnormal for a congressman and his local newspaper. Members of Congress tend to have at least somewhat chummy relationships with the local press, but the Fresno Bee has decided to spend most of its energy attacking Nunes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and has, through the parent company McClatchy, dispatched the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s congressional correspondent Kate Irby to write an extraordinary amount of pieces about him. Irby has written, since Aug. 1, a total of 35 articles. Seventeen of them, nearly half of the work she has done in the past couple months, have been about Nunes. One piece she printed in the wake of the first HPSCI hearing after the Democrats in Washington officially opened their \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeachment inquiry\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Trump was about Nunes\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opening statement in that hearing, when Nunes ribbed the committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) for having been pranked by Russian shock jocks pretending to be a Ukrainian government official with dirt\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically nude photos\u00e2\u0080\u0094of President Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd of course, Democrats on this very committee negotiated with people who they thought were Ukrainians in order to obtain nude pictures of Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nunes said in his opening statement, referencing the widely-reported incident where Schiff was pranked by Russians pretending to be Ukrainians with nude pictures of Trump. The recording of the phone call where Schiff was pranked was so widely-reported when it first was reported in 2018, and again this year after Nunes brought this up at the hearing\u00e2\u0080\u0094President Trump even tweeted about it after the hearing\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is obvious to what and to whom Nunes was referring. After The Atlantic broke the story on it, it has been covered by, of course, Breitbart News, but also\u00c2\u00a0RealClearPolitics, Roll Call, the Daily Mail, the Washington Examiner, the New York Post, International Business Times, the Daily Wire, Town Hall, Fox News, PJ Media, \u00c2\u00a0Rush Limbaugh, IJR, The Week, the Washington Post, the Washington Times, among countless other media outlets. In other words, this is an easy one given how widely covered Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call was: McClatchy could have easily figured this out, and should have. But the headline of Irby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story implied this was some kind of new, explosive charge: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDevin Nunes says House Democrats are seeking \u00e2\u0080\u0098nude pictures of Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d But in her piece, Irby suggests this was some kind of mystery, writing that Nunes \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid not identify who he believes attempted to obtain nude photos of the president.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She even suggested later in her copy that it came, somehow, from the infamous \u00e2\u0080\u009cSteele Dossier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Irby wrote: Nunes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 allegation that Democrats sought nude photos of Trump is likely related to claims contained in the so-called dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele as opposition research against Trump for the 2016 presidential election. Irby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inaccurate story is not the only one the Fresno Bee ran making these false claims against Nunes. The newspaper actually ran an unsigned editorial by its \u00e2\u0080\u009cMcClatchy California Opinion Editors\u00e2\u0080\u009d that furthers the false smear against the congressman. In it, McClatchy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s editors again falsely state about Nunes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe alleged, without evidence, that Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee had sought nude photos of Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of course, the ample evidence of Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone call in the public sphere\u00e2\u0080\u0094a recording of it is available for the listening of the newspaper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staff if they so chose to attempt to accurately report on this, and anyone else in the world who wants to listen to it\u00e2\u0080\u0094is somehow not enough for the Fresno Bee. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, the newspaper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unsigned editorial also falsely includes Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA)\u00e2\u0080\u0094another GOP congressman from California\u00e2\u0080\u0094in its attacks on Nunes, falsely claiming that McClintock was a member of the House Intelligence Committee. McClintock is not on the House Intelligence Committee. But that did not stop the Fresno Bee from inaccurately claiming he does sit on the committee and was at the hearing with Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring a House hearing into the whistle-blower complaint against President Donald Trump, Rep. Tom McClintock and Rep. Devin Nunes displayed a stunning lack of honesty, and a non-existent grasp of reality, in their attempts to protect Trump from his self-inflicted Ukraine scandal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Fresno Bee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unsigned editorial reads. A quick check of the HPSCI membership list available on the congressional committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website would have confirmed that McClintock is not a member of the House Intelligence Committee. Confronted with these clear inaccuracies and the above proof and evidence that the statements the Fresno Bee ran were inaccurate\u00e2\u0080\u0094the one in Irby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s piece and in the unsigned editorial about Nunes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 opening statement, and the one in the unsigned editorial about McClintock somehow serving on the House Intelligence Committee and attending the Maguire hearing when he is not and did not\u00e2\u0080\u0094McClatchy told Breitbart News it has decided not to correct the fake news it printed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMcClatchy stands behind the accuracy of The Fresno Bee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reporting on Representative Devin Nunes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the statement from McClatchy spokeswoman Jeanne Segal reads. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHolding those in power to account is the role of a free press and a cornerstone of our democracy. We are dedicated to bringing unparalleled local journalism to our communities backed up by irrefutable facts, as we have for more than 160 years. We will continue to report the facts and tell the stories that are essential to our readers and our communities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Segal did not answer detailed questions about the editorial processes, including which company officials at McClatchy were involved in printing the inaccuracies. Segal also refused to answer any questions regarding the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial picture, or provide any details about how the Fresno Bee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coverage of Nunes has factored into the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future financial planning as Gustus admitted to in the Nieman Labs interview. She did, however, provide the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already public press release about the NYSE threatening to delist McClatchy because it has fallen out of compliance the stock exchange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standards. The Sept. 13 press release includes a company announcement that back on Sept. 9, McClatchy \u00e2\u0080\u009creceived a notice from NYSE American LLC\u00e2\u0080\u009d that revealed \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the Company is not currently in compliance with certain listing standards, and as noted below, has approximately 18 months to become compliant under a plan that is subject to approval by NYSE American.\u00e2\u0080\u009d McClatchy noted: McClatchy is below compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i) and 1003(a)(ii) of the NYSE American continued listing standards since it reported stockholders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 deficit of $372.5 million as of June 30, 2019 and net losses in each of the four most recent fiscal years ended December 30, 2018. However, NYSE American will not normally consider suspending dealings in, or removing from the list, the securities of an issuer which is below the continued listing standards set forth in Sections 1003(a)(i)-(iii) if the issuer meets certain other criteria, including, among others, total assets and revenues of $50 million in the last fiscal year or in two of the last three fiscal years, and a market value of publicly held shares (as defined by NYSE American) of at least $15 million. The release said McClatchy intends to submit a plan to the NYSE by Wednesday of this week\u00e2\u0080\u0094the plan should have been submitted by the time of the publication of this article\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cadvising how the Company plans to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by March 9, 2021.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf NYSE American does not accept the plan or the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards as of March 9, 2021, or does not make progress consistent with the plan, NYSE American may initiate delisting procedures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McClatchy noted. If the NYSE removes McClatchy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s listing, it would be another significant financial blow to the once-great newspaper company. That gets back to the broader question as to whether the McClatchy family\u00e2\u0080\u0094which still has control over the news organization\u00e2\u0080\u0094will have to sell the company, as the Graham family had to sell the Washington Post to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The Poynter article from September 2018 explores this question. Poynter wrote: The McClatchy family got into the newspaper business with The Bee of Sacramento in 1857. The family maintains control of the company because it has two classes of stock; their B shares would override what public A shareholders might want should there be a conflict. Four family members sit on the board, otherwise largely made up of tech executives. This is the same arrangement that gives the Sulzberger family control of The New York Times Co. Their hold on the 150-year-old Times was tested in the sharp 2008-2009 downturn and required a high-interest loan and investment from Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helu to get through. Lately, with robust digital subscription growth and a stream of new products, the Times is back on a healthy financial track. Conversely, I and other analysts thought that the Graham family had a forever commitment to keeping The Washington Post. But five years ago, CEO Don Graham and his niece, publisher Katharine Weymouth, decided they did not have a strong strategy or the capital to finance a next wave of growth. So they sold to Jeff Bezos. If the McClatchys can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t outrun the math, that day could come for them, too. Interestingly, as Breitbart News was asking McClatchy about this past round of fake news regarding Nunes from the Maguire hearing, the Fresno Bee went and ran another column on Wednesday which contains more blatant inaccuracies about Nunes. The column, from Marek Warszawski, falsely claims that at a July HPSCI hearing with Special Counsel Robert Mueller testifying Nunes attempted to change the subject to the Uranium One scandal with failed 2016 Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. Warszawski wrote, misspelling Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name: Remember the Robert Muller hearing, called by congressional leaders in July to try and get to the bottom of whether Trump benefited from Russian interference in the 2016 election?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warszawski wrote, misspelling Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, our favorite congressman was having none of that. Instead, Nunes peddled an alternative theory: That it was the Obama administration, including Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, which conspired with Russia to give the Russians a stake in U.S. uranium production and make the Clintons filthy rich. The problem with Warszawski\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim is that as a hearing transcript and the text of Nunes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 opening statement would easily show, Nunes never brought up the Uranium One scandal during the July Mueller hearing before HPSCI. In other words, McClatchy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to getting caught printing fake news in order to artificially inflate its revenues amid sliding stock prices is to just turn around and print more of the same fake news\u00e2\u0080\u0093while not correcting any of the mistakes it made. Segal, unsurprisingly, has not replied to a follow-up request for comment on the Fresno Bee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest fake column from Warszawski.",

      "content": " Biden, as vice president, pushed for the firing of the then-chief prosecutor of Ukraine, who had been investigating the CEO of a company that employed his son on its board at $50,000 a month. At Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s urging, the chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin was fired and the investigation was eventually closed. Biden, during an official work trip to China in late 2013,\u00c2\u00a0brought his son, who had business meetings during the trip. After the trip, a Chinese private equity fund his son was forming received a Chinese business license that brought the fund into existence. Paul told reporters Tuesday on a conference call, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m with most Americans that Hunter Biden making $50,000 a month doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pass the smell test. It sounds really corrupt, I think most Americans are beginning to believe that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He continued: In China it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to tell what is a private investment in Joe Biden and his son, and what is a government investment and obviously it\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be much more worrisome if the Chinese government were involved in paying Hunter Biden for investing in his fund, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beyond the pale of consideration because so many of the companies in China \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the government retains a 50% interest in a lot of so-called private entities over there, so yeah, I think we should find out if the Chinese government made an indirect or direct investment in Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son. I think absolutely. Paul also dismissed suggestions that it was wrong of Trump to ask Ukraine or China to get involved in U.S. politics. He said: Now people want to word this as \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, getting involved in our political system.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Well political figures can be corrupt and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meant that just because they are a political figure we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t investigate them. And the Bidens are political figures \u00e2\u0080\u0094 does that mean if you investigate them it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a campaign contribution or something ridiculous? \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think political figures who commit corruption will and should be investigated. And the only way you figure out the truth of this is looking back at all records \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Ukrainian records and Chinese records\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I am not so sure there there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some law that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broken by asking for [the] investigation of corrupt political officials and their families,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": "  This comes in the wake of a top-ranking congressional intelligence committee staffer facing similar charges of leaking last year and sets the stage for a larger fight between Trump and intelligence community leakers. The nature of these intelligence community leakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 deeply personal relationships with the reporters to whom they were leaking \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both cases involved romantic relationships \u00e2\u0080\u0094 seems more like a House of Cards episode than real life. But the federal law enforcement charges against each casts the intelligence community as a whole in a deeply negative light, as Democrats on Capitol Hill begin to rely on these spooks for their increasingly partisan impeachment efforts against Trump. The case of the intelligence leaker ensnared Wednesday showed how anti-Trump intelligence officials are risking their careers and using their relationships with the media to leak classified information embarrassing to the Trump administration. Henry Kyle Frese, an employee with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), was charged with two counts of leaking classified information to two journalists identified by journalist Matthew Keys and later the Wall Street Journal as CNBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Amanda Macias and NBC News\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Courtney Kube. Frese and Macias were romantically involved. The complaint against Frese said, in or about mid-April to May 2018, he accessed an intelligence report unrelated to his job duties \u00e2\u0080\u009con multiple occasions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A week after he accessed the report a second time, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJournalist 1\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 believed to be Macias, asked him to speak to \u00e2\u0080\u009cJournalist 2\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 believed to be Kube. Frese told Journalist 1 he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cdown\u00e2\u0080\u009d to help Journalist 2 if it helped her because he wanted to see her \u00e2\u0080\u009cprogress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Frese would later search on a classified U.S. government computer system for terms related to the topics contained in the intelligence report. A few hours after searching those terms, he spoke with Journalist 1 for seven minutes, and spoke to Journalist 2 for over half an hour. About half an hour after he spoke with both journalists, Journalist 1 published an article through her outlet, which contained classified information from the report. After Journalist 1 tweeted the article, Frese retweeted it. In September 2019, Frese accessed two additional intelligence reports, and texted Journalist 2 to tell her to call him. During the call, he transmitted classified information. The Justice Department said in a statement that Frese \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas caught red-handed disclosing sensitive national security information for personal gain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe unauthorized disclosure of top secret information could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave harm to the national security of the United States,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it said. Prosecutors said Macias published eight articles containing classified defense information between May and July 2018, according to the Guardian. Frese was arrested Wednesday when he showed up for work and was due to appear later that day in U.S. district court in Alexandria, Virginia. Frese, like the intelligence official who recently filed a whistleblower complaint against Trump, has a background in Russia and NATO, according to his Twitter profile. The episode carried echoes of a previous case of an intelligence official leaking to a reporter he was romantically involved with. In 2018, James Wolfe, a fifty-something senior aide to the Senate Intelligence Committee, leaked classified documents to New York Times reporter Ali Watkins, with whom he was having a romantic relationship. Wolfe worked at the committee while it was investigating whether Trump colluded with Russia, and he leaked to Watkins classified material, such as an application for a surveillance warrant on former Trump campaign official Carter Page. The announcement of Frese\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrest broke loose a barrage of anger and mocking, particularly from conservatives and Trump supporters who have become increasingly frustrated with intelligence officials leaking and hiding behind the cloak of anonymity.  The Federalist Senior Editor Mollie Hemingway called the culture of politicized leaking \u00e2\u0080\u009cworrisome\u00e2\u0080\u009d: Review of arrested leaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social media shows, in addition to extreme anti-Trump views, confidence there\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be no repercussions for leaking. He freely and openly engages with recipient of stolen information. Our natsec culture of politicized leaking is worrisome.  Frese\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter account has a number of anti-Trump tweets. Like Frese, the intelligence official behind the whistleblower complaint against Trump also used classified material that somehow made its way to the press. His concerns stemmed from a classified telephone call between the president and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that only government officials had direct and indirect access to. Those concerns made their way to an aide of\u00c2\u00a0House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Schiff himself, but\u00c2\u00a0were kept hidden from Republicans. Instead, Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aide instructed the whistleblower to seek legal counsel and file a whistleblower complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, which would afford him more protections and allow the committee more latitude in publicizing his complaints. House Democrats then used those concerns to launch an impeachment inquiry. A lawyer for the whistleblower told Breitbart News on Tuesday that the whistleblower, or anyone else he and his team will represent, have no intentions of revealing their identities, raising the specter of an anonymous official leading to the impeachment of a president. But Frese\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrest also showed that the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to crack down on illegal leaks since 2017 are bearing fruit. Frese\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case is the sixth federal case involving leaks of classified information in a little over two years, according to the Guardian. The first case involved Reality Winner, a former intelligence analyst who leaked a report about\u00c2\u00a0Russian interference in the 2016 election to the Intercept. She is currently serving five years in jail. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrese betrayed the trust placed in him by the American people, a betrayal that risked harming the national security of this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Demers, assistant attorney general, in a phone call with reporters.",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a former chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced her endorsement of the former vice president on Tuesday,\u00c2\u00a0claiming to have witnessed Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfortitude\u00e2\u0080\u009d and leadership during their overlapping tenures in Congress. Feinstein said in a statement: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitud. During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard working American families. The endorsement comes as Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign is besieged by scandal regarding the lucrative business dealings his youngest son, Hunter, had with foreign governments. Only hours before Feinstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endorsement,\u00c2\u00a0the Chinese government announced it would not investigate how Hunter Biden ended up at the center of one its top private equity firms. The Chinese foreign ministry made the decision after President Donald Trump publicly called for a probe of Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Bohai Harvest RST (BHR). In particular, Trump has noted that the circumstances surrounding BHR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creation could have posed a conflict of interest for Joe Biden. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling\u00c2\u00a0book\u00c2\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,\u00c2\u00a0Hunter Biden inked the multibillion-dollar deal that created BHR with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013. The timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two.\u00c2\u00a0Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018\u00c2\u00a0interview\u00c2\u00a0with\u00c2\u00a0Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $1.5 billion venture with China: In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. For basically not challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this. Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June,\u00c2\u00a0Hunter Biden was still\u00c2\u00a0involved\u00c2\u00a0with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000. Such dealings at the center of politics and business, while perhaps not illegal, are not exclusive to the Biden family alone. As a few noted at the time of Feinstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endorsement, the senator and her husband have their own close ties to the communist country. During her tenure as mayor of San Francisco in the late-1970s and early-1980s, Feinstein took advantage of the newly normalized diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China by establishing one of the first sister city partnership between San Francisco and Shanghai. Through that partnership, Feinstein led trade delegations to China in which she and her husband, Richard Blum, became acquainted with some of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most prominent political leaders. As the Federalist noted in August 2018, Feinstein and her husband leveraged those relationships to boost their own wealth. In 1986, Feinstein and Jiang Zemin \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the then-mayor of Shanghai, who would later ascend to the presidency of the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of China \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cdesignated several corporate entities for fostering commercial relations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One of those firms was Shanghai Pacific Partners, which employed Blum as a director. Blum reportedly had an interest of upwards of $500,000 in a project backed by Shanghai Pacific Partners. After Feinstein was elected to the Senate in 1992, Blum continued profiting off their ties to China. A the same time, the freshman lawmaker was pitching herself as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina hand\u00e2\u0080\u009d to colleagues, even once claiming \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat in my last life maybe I was Chinese.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Through her seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Feinstein led the fight on a number of initiatives seen as being favorable to China, including granting the country\u00c2\u00a0permanent most-favored-nation trading status in 2000. Despite Feinstein and her husband having a close relationship with Jiang, the Chinese government targeted the senator as part of its espionage operations. In the early 2000s, the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) recruited a longtime employee of the senator to gather information about the inner workings of her congressional and district offices. Feinstein only learned of the staffer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s duplicity in 2013, after he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d already been on her payroll for more than 20 years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile this person, who was a liaison to the local Chinese community, was fired, charges were never filed against him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Politico reported in 2018, speculating that because \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe staffer was providing political intelligence and not classified information\u00e2\u0080\u0094making prosecution far more difficult.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Apart from the convoluted history of the senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ties to China, the political timing of Feinstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endorsement also caught many off guard.\u00c2\u00a0The California Democrat, who hosted a fundraiser on Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf last week\u00c2\u00a0alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (D-CA) daughter, is only the most recent figure from the Democrat establishment to openly pledge support for the former vice president. Feinstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endorsement, however, was not totally expected, especially since her seamate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), is mounting a bid of her own for the Democrat nomination. In fact, earlier this year, Feinsten flirted with the notion of remaining neutral in the 2020 contest out of respect for Harris. Compounding the political picture is that most polls show Biden no longer the favorite to win California, having fallen behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Feinstein, however, did not address any of that when endorsing the former vice president on Tuesday. Instead, the senator offered platitudes about Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work to enhance gun control and how his campaign was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfight to restore the soul of the nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": " Fox News reported on Wednesday that BHR owns a stake in Megvii Technology, a Chinese technology company that designs image recognition and deep-learning software. Megvii, whose technology is in line with China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to use facial recognition systems to boost its civilian surveillance capacities, is also partially backed by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba. The company, which plans to launch its initial public offering sometime later this year, was blacklisted by the Trump administration earlier this week on the grounds that its technology had been used by the Chinese government to repress the Muslim minorities in the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Xinjiang Uighur region. The Commerce Department said that Megvii is one of 28 Chinese companies that will be banned from doing business in the U.S. because of such conduct. The Trump administration said in denouncing the decision: Specifically, these entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in [Xinjiang]. The news came shortly after BHR disclosed it was weighing if and how it should explain its working relationship with Hunter Biden amid public scrutiny over his business dealings with the government of China. The controversy first started when President Donald Trump\u00c2\u00a0called\u00c2\u00a0on the Chinese government to investigate the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ties to the Biden family. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling\u00c2\u00a0book\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hunter Biden inked the multibillion dollar deal that created BHR with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013.

Apart from the shadowy timing of BHR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inception, the company and Hunter Biden have also caught the eye of investigators in Congress for the purchase of a\u00c2\u00a0U.S. company with insight into military technology. In 2015, BHR and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an aerospace and defense conglomerate owned and operated by the Chinese government \u00e2\u0080\u0094 made\u00c2\u00a0a $600 million bid to purchase Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company. The sale required approval from the Obama-Biden administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), as AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges produced \u00e2\u0080\u009cdual-use\u00e2\u0080\u009d anti-vibration technology with U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u009cmilitary applications.\u00e2\u0080\u009d CFIUS, which is\u00c2\u00a0made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies including the Departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, is\u00c2\u00a0required\u00c2\u00a0to review any transaction with national security implications. When the AVIC and BHR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bid was first announced, alarm bells went off in certain sectors of the defense industry.\u00c2\u00a0In particular, many noted that AVIC\u00c2\u00a0was \u00e2\u0080\u009creportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which it later \u00e2\u0080\u009creportedly incorporated \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 into China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s J-20 and J\u00e2\u0080\u009131 aircraft.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite the national security concerns, CFIUS approved the deal with AVIC, purchasing 51 percent of the company while BHR took ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter\u00c2\u00a0stated\u00c2\u00a0the deal was the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbiggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although the deal was approved by the Obama administration, it has not escaped congressional scrutiny. In August,\u00c2\u00a0Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) launched a\u00c2\u00a0probe\u00c2\u00a0into whether or not the CFIUS decision was influenced by either Joe Biden or former Secretary of State John Kerry, whose stepson was also involved in the venture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe direct involvement of Mr. Hunter Biden and Mr. Heinz in the acquisition of Henniges by the Chinese government creates a potential conflict of interest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grassley noted when launching the probe. In the wake of such scrutiny, the former vice president has refused to answer questions regarding his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business dealings, choosing rather to accuse Trump of abusing his power. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne thing about this president is absolutely clear, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think anyone can contradict this, he has seen no limits to his power regardless of what the Constitution says,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden said on Wednesday when calling for the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment.",

      "subtitle": "Republican legislators are working with Democrats to pass an amnesty for roughly one million illegal migrant farm laborers, according to a top Democrat staffer.",
      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": " \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been working on on a package that both provides a good legalization program for undocumented farmworkers to come out of the shadows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\u00c2\u00a0David Shahoulian, a top staffer on the Democrat-run House Judiciary committee. In exchange for providing the Democrat Party with a new population of government-dependent voters, the GOP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s farm companies would get cheap, flexible, and legal labor, according to the Democrat staffer. The deal \u00e2\u0080\u009cprovides reforms to the H-2A [uncapped visa worker] program to make it kind of a more streamlined program, kind of an easier to use, you know, kind of more business-friendly-but-still-protect-workers kind of program,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told an October 7 meeting of migration advocates at Georgetown University. The deal is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca typical unholy alliance between the cheap-labor [business] interests and the more-migration [political] interests,\u00e2\u0080\u009d responded Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies. It shows that the Democrats are willing to \u00e2\u0080\u009cabandon their interest in protecting guest workers in order to get an amnesty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. The bipartisan voters-for-cheap-labor swap may be announced very soon and then put on a fast track to the Senate. Shahoulian provided few details of the deal except that it would cover one million farmworkers. Several farmworker proposals\u00c2\u00a0in 2017 and 2018 allowed many illegal aliens to transition into legal guest workers before getting green cards and citizenship. The bipartisan plans also assumed that farmworkers would quickly migrate away from the farms to urban jobs where they would help reduce wages for Americans in urban jobs. So the deals allowed farm companies to import at least one million replacement farmworkers via the existing H-2A or projected H-2C\u00c2\u00a0visa programs. Those deals allowed the migrant workers to take jobs in the broadly defined food sector, perhaps allowing them to replace blue-collar Americans in meatpacking plants, food-processing facilities, and even food-distribution tasks. However, those deals failed because the GOP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voter base is increasingly aware of the economic impact of cheap labor migration. Republican Senator and House members from agricultural states are backing the \u00e2\u0080\u009clegalization\u00e2\u0080\u009d deal, Shahoulian said: There are some important Republican senators who are in discussions with us and the Republicans that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re speaking to and who are rooting for us, who know what our package looks like and would like to see it come out of the House, and they think they can take it over there. Now, you know, will [Majority Leader Sen. Mitch] McConnell let it go to the floor? Will will this president and Steven Miller see it, and, you know \u00e2\u0080\u0094 excuse my language \u00e2\u0080\u0094 crap all over it and kill it? Yeah, I mean, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very possible, but you gotta try. The cooperative GOP legislators likely include Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford\u00c2\u00a0and U.S. representatives from dairy districts, Vaughan said. The deal is likely also backed by pro-business factions in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s White House, said Vaughan.\u00c2\u00a0Sonny Perdue, the Secretary of Agriculture, and Mick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief of staff, have a long history of supporting cheap labor programs for agricultural companies, she said. Many farm companies dislike the H-2A program, which allows employers to import temporary workers for up to $15.00 per hour of work. There is no cap on the program, which grew slowly from 16,000 in 1997 to up to 90,000 in 2014. But Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s combination of a growing economy and \u00e2\u0080\u009cHire American\u00e2\u0080\u009d policies are nudging up wages \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even for illegal aliens. In response, farm companies rushed to hire 243,000 H-2A workers in 2018. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wage increases are also pressuring farm companies to develop and order American-made, labor-saving machinery, including strawberry picking and cow milking robots. However, the federal government does little to promote the use of labor-saving robots.  Republicans who back the amnesty will cripple Trump, their GOP colleagues, and their voters, Vaughan warned: This is the folly of Republicans who live in agriculture areas who think that it is a good idea or a smart strategy to serve agriculture interests. Ultimately they are going to put themselves and their party out of a job because of the demographic effects and likely political effects down the line \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 In the long term, it is a disaster for their party, their own ability to stay in power, and for their constituents. Trump should override the business faction in the GOP to block the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 push for a farmworker amnesty, she said. He should not be signing off on any guest worker or legal immigration deals before the border and enforcement problems are under better control. It does not matter what the rules are for any new deal if the rules are not getting enforced anyway. [Also] he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s giving away his best bargaining chips and leaving himself without any leverage to get the needed enforcement [in a 2021 deal]. Why would he make a [2019] deal like this before he has his budget for DHS? Before he has what he needs for funding interior enforcement?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The agriculture bill is just one of several migration bills being pushed quietly by Democrats. In June, Democrats passed their \u00e2\u0080\u009cDREAM\u00e2\u0080\u009d act bill to amnesty the population of approximately three million youths and adults who were brought into the country by their migrant parents. Democrats are using the same cheap-labor-for-voters strategy to pass a law offering fast track green cards to Indian college graduates who use H-1B visas to take jobs from American graduates. The House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s green card giveaway bill, guided by Shahoulian, passed the House with 140 GOP votes in July amid silence from the media establishment. GOP Sen. Mike Lee is trying to push a matching bill through the Senate amid silence from GOP Senators and conditional opposition from Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin. Since 1990, the promise of green cards in exchange for college graduate labor has helped bring roughly four million Indians into the United States. The Indian immigrants have a high income, naturally align with the pro-diversity Democrat Party, and are now becoming a political factor, especially in Texas. For example, Texas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 22nd district was once the GOP power base for former House Majority Leader Rep. Tom Delay. It is now a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmajority-minority\u00e2\u0080\u009d district in which Indian and Chinese immigrants may help elect the son of an Indian immigrant to Congress in November 2020. The U.S. has a resident population of roughly 1.5 million college graduate visa workers who have forced down salaries for American college graduates. This massive subsidy for brand name employers, such as Amazon and Facebook, is largely ignored by the college graduates who work as journalists in the established media. So far, no GOP senator has announced opposition to Lee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s S.368 green card giveaway bill. The bill is backed by Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, WalMart, and other business groups that want to expand their business in India.  Democrats must focus on single-sector bills because of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 election, Shahoulian told the pro-migrant progressives at the Georgetown conference: You know, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always put everything all together and always, you know, kind of attacked the issue comprehensively. As you know, \u00e2\u0080\u009cComprehensive Immigration Reform\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the catchword \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There was a realization after this administration [got elected] that that was not likely. And so there have now been attempts to try to move things in a more piecemeal kind of fashion, the DREAM Act being one of those things. Shahoulian told Democrats at the Georgetown event that Democrats must offer incentives to get cooperation from GOP legislators. But he provided a very skewed portrayal of the motivations: Many of you know this is the way I think: Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives are kind of wired differently, right? We [Democrats] are wired to be justice-oriented and outcome-orientated, like what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the just outcome? How do we get there? And how do we interpret the law to make sure that is it results in the most just outcome? Republicans really come at it by saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are the rules? You know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s black and white. And did you follow the rules or not follow the rules? What does the law say, and what doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way they approach the issues. Once you understand that they have a real legitimate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some of them are motivated by other things \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but those who are motivated by just the rule of law. You have to figure out how to deal with that. They get that the rules were antiquated and that there weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pathways, legal pathways, to really meet our economic needs. But you still have to recognize that people did something unlawful or are here unlawfully. But business groups \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and their allies among GOP politicians \u00e2\u0080\u0094 merely use this \u00e2\u0080\u009clegal good/illegal bad\u00e2\u0080\u009d claim as a political fig leaf to conceal their eagerness to hire cheap migrants instead of Americans, Vaughan said. Conservative Americans \u00e2\u0080\u009ccare about the effects of the visa programs on their employment prospects, their taxes, and their communities,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as their ethical priorities expand in circles around their own family, their community, the nation, and then to foreign peoples, she said. Shahoulians\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cjustice-oriented,\u00e2\u0080\u009d however, did not mention that Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sense of justice telescopes out beyond Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concerns about their careers and families. In contrast to conservatives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expanding circles of concern, progressives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 universalist mindset causes them to prefer caring about the distant peoples from Central America, India, and Africa. This mindset also encourages progressives to prefer foreigners who can strengthen the pro-diversity political party in the United States.       ",

Two Killed, One Arrested in Shooting at German Synagogue https://t.co/J43iSRLEqV \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 9, 2019  At least two people were shot dead in the eastern German city of Halle on Wednesday, with a synagogue among the targets. The suspect, identified by German media as 27-year-old German Stephan Balliet, filmed the assault and posted the video online. The rampage was streamed live for 35 minutes on Twitch, and eventually seen by some 2,200 people, the online platform said, in a chilling reminder of the mosque attack in Christchurch, New Zealand last March which was also online in real-time. The US Embassy in Berlin tweeted its condemnation of the attack as well. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis attack is an attack on all of us and the perpetrators must be held accountable. We mourn the victims of this senseless violence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the tweet read. The embassy announced that 10 Americans were in the synagogue at the time of the attack. Dr. Moshe Kantor, President of the European Jewish Congress has commented that, \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are relieved that an even greater tragedy was avoided because of the security around the synagogue which apparently took measures to ensure that the attacker was not able to enter into the premises. However, that Jews observing one of the holiest days of the year were targeted for death should send shock waves in Germany and beyond. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to do more to guarantee these types of attacks do not happen again, by combatting radicalisation, creating tougher law enforcement measures and putting more resources into educating towards tolerance. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and wishing the injured a speedy recovery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Monday, the Central Council of Jews in Germany condemned German authorities for \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegligence\u00e2\u0080\u009d after it released a man who\u00c2\u00a0attempted to run into a synagogue armed with a knife\u00c2\u00a0in central Berlin on Friday evening.

      "subtitle": "Tony Blair has blamed weak leadership in the Labour Party for making a clean-break Brexit a possibility.",
      "author": "Victoria Friedman",
      "content": " \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be very frank, if you had a really strong opposition, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the Government would for a single moment contemplate a no-deal Brexit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the former Labour prime minister and Remain campaigner said. While not mentioning Mr Corbyn by name, Mr Blair, who took Labour in a progressive-globalist direction for a decade under his leadership, criticised the socialist for turning the party into \u00e2\u0080\u009chostile territory for centrists\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd my worry, quite apart from all the other things, is at the moment, the leadership of the Labour Party is essentially a protest leadership and it is not a governing leadership. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you want to govern you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to have that governing attitude,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr Blair said during a Reform Scotland event in comments reported by the Evening Standard. Recent meetings with leaders of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), the Liberal Democrats, and other anti-Brexit parties have revealed Labour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0perceived ineptitude in leading a Remain Rebellion. Notably, cross-party talks have failed over leaders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unwillingness to accept Mr Corbyn as the interim prime minister of a proposed caretaker government.  Jeremy Corbyn met with the SNP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ian\u00c2\u00a0Blackford, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, the Greens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Caroline Lucas, Plaid Cymru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Liz Saville Roberts, and Anna Soubry of the Independent Group for Change on Monday to discuss an emergency motion to take over the House of Commons and strengthen efforts against a clean-break Brexit. However, the other parties reportedly objected to making Corbyn the caretaker prime minister, blaming the socialist for getting in the way of stopping no-deal. One Liberal Democrat source told the Metro: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe position Jeremy Corbyn is taking is that we can have an emergency Government, but only if he gets to lead it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey know they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the numbers, but they are insistent they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work with anyone else. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir total unwillingness to work with anyone else makes the Labour Party the biggest barrier to stopping no-deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Last month, Blair articulated his lack of confidence in Corbyn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prospects to be the next prime minister when he urged him to block a snap election. Remarking that voters may \u00e2\u0080\u009cfear\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Corbyn government, he said:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe opposition vote is going to split and under our system, that delivers a comfortable Tory majority.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As well as failing to join the leftist parties under one Remain roof, Labour is also failing to articulate clearly its position on Brexit. A ComRes poll revealed 66 per cent of Britons agreed that \u00e2\u0080\u009cLabour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Brexit policy is a mystery to me\u00e2\u0080\u009d. By party, that breaks down to\u00c2\u00a078 per cent of Leave voters, 59 per cent of Remain voters, and even nearly half \u00e2\u0080\u0094 47 per cent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of Labour voters. A recent ComRes poll puts the Conservatives in the lead with 33 per cent of the vote, a comfortable 16 points ahead of Labour. Labour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confusing position on Brexit could also cost them votes.\u00c2\u00a0Corbyn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s party has\u00c2\u00a0isolated its core working-class Leave voters by reneging on its pledge to respect the 2016 vote by backing a second referendum. However, some in the party want Labour to go farther left, joining the Liberal Democrats in supporting the cancellation Brexit altogether. ",

Kamala Harris (D-CA) said members of President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration were \u00e2\u0080\u009cviolating\u00e2\u0080\u009d their oath to defend the Constitution by mounting a defense to the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment inquiry. On a letter she sent to members of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cabinet, Harris said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo put everyone on notice, this is a process that is about pursuit of justice and truth and that we are not going to tolerate in our role of oversight any conduct that interferes with that process, and so we are putting members of the cabinet on notice that they have a duty and a responsibility to preserve evidence to protect whistleblowers and the inspector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general of the various agencies and cooperate with the process. And frankly, to your point, the letter perhaps is unique because I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think in recent history we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the need for those kinds of obvious points to be made but with this administration. We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take anything for granted, especially when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the highest elected official in our government, Donald Trump actively engaged in the suppress of evidence and the intimidation of witnesses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When asked about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter to Congress saying they will not corporate with the impeachment inquiry, Harris said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a moment that highlights the magnificent brilliance of the framers of our constitution and the Founders of our nation who imagined such a moment where there would be an outright and obvious, at this point, abuse of power by one branch of government, in this case, the executive branch and the need therefore for these kinds of checks and balances. So the letter today from Senator Blumenthal and myself and so many others who have stood up to stand for accountability and for our democracy is about living what our Founders imagine might be necessary, which is to have these checks and balances. But that statement is ridiculous and is clearly just another example of members of this administration who frankly are violating their oath.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say that purposely. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like they are ignoring it or overlooking it. They are violating it. They took an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And I think it is clear that there are enemies who are American citizens, enemies to our democracy. This is a moment where everyone should have the courage to stand up and speak to the values of our Constitution and our democracy and our system of justice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the product of protracted negotiations led by then-Secretary of State John Kerry, was widely viewed as the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signature foreign policy achievement. Withdrawal from the same was a Donald Trump campaign promise. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out. Another promise fulfilled \u00e2\u009c\u0094\u00ef\u00b8\u008f \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I make promises I keep them\u00e2\u0080\u009d @realDonaldTrump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) May 8, 2018  Khamenei said last week that Tehran will continue abandoning commitments to the deal as long as the U.S. keeps hitting Iran with sanctions. Khamenei also told the crowd of academics they should focus on their\u00c2\u00a0religion and nationality while rejecting any notion of copying the U.S. in any manner. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want science but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want our universities to be a reproduction of some U.S. university,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Khamenei said. He hailed Iranian achievements in medical science, engineering, nanotechnology and peaceful nuclear energy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe live in a different situation than others,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Khamenei said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to think Iranian, act Iranian and live Iranian and this trend can be accelerated by adopting the Islamic-Iranian Blueprint for Progress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He explained: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe path we are taking is neither one of socialism, nor of liberal democracy. We have suggested a third path to save nations from the decadent Western culture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although\u00c2\u00a0Khamenei works hard to build the case for a peace-loving Iran that would never embrace nuclear weapons, his words directly contradict what he said previously. As Breitbart News reported,\u00c2\u00a0there is a\u00c2\u00a0letter from Khameini that\u00c2\u00a0calls for the development of nuclear weapons. Regardless of what\u00c2\u00a0Khamenei\u00c2\u00a0says, in Iran, it is still Khameini\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order that is deemed supreme. The letter was\u00c2\u00a0written by Khameini in\u00c2\u00a01988 and released by former President Hashemi Rafsanjani 18 years later, in September of 2006. The missive is at direct odds with Tehran and the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statements Iran is not seeking a nuclear bomb because it goes against Islam. In his \u00e2\u0080\u009988 letter, Khameini called for the Islamic Republic to have \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe ability to make\u00c2\u00a0a substantial number of laser and atomic weapons which will be the necessity of the war at that time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A link to the\u00c2\u00a0translation of the original letter\u00c2\u00a0was published by the Council on Foreign Relations. In closing his letter, Khameini wrote,\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe aware of God and whatever happens, it is His decision.\u00c2\u00a0Peace be upon pious people.\u00c2\u00a0Ruhollah Al-Musavi al-Khomeyni.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

When you lose, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr Verhofstadt is a committed EU federalist known for his bombastic, and at times inflammatory, language.

But we should not forget that the efforts of these men were not appreciated by the Common Man they claimed to represent because they all ended up on the guillotine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he had said. The senior liberal politician recently called for the European Union to become an empire.

      "content": " Taiwan is a fully sovereign nation with a functioning democracy and thriving economy. The Communist Party of China considers it a rogue province of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmainland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d its term for the legal boundaries of China, and regularly bullies other countries and international institutions to exclude Taiwan from the international community. Tsai encouraged her people to embrace their national identity and values of freedom and democracy as an example to the world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are witnessing China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise and expansion, as they challenge free, democratic values and the global order through a combination of authoritarianism, nationalism, and economic might,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tsai said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the strategic forefront of the Indo-Pacific region, Taiwan has become the first line of defense for democratic values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is encroaching on us through their sharp power, but as a crucial member of the region, we know that Taiwan must fulfill its responsibilities to the international community. We will not act provocatively or rashly; rather, we will work with like-minded countries to ensure that the peaceful and stable cross-strait status quo is not unilaterally altered,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. Tsai, up for reelection this year, also hinted at the political divide in the country naturally caused by elections, urging Taiwanese people to resist divisions that could negatively alter national values. \u00e2\u0080\u009c[W]e cannot be divided amongst ourselves, regardless of party affiliation. No one has a patent on the Republic of China, and no one can monopolize Taiwan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tsai affirmed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe words \u00e2\u0080\u0098Republic of China (Taiwan)\u00e2\u0080\u0099 are not the exclusive property of any one political party, and that is the overwhelming consensus of Taiwan society.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tsai responded with a resounding rejection to Chinese Communist Party dictator Xi Jinping\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call last week for Beijing to annex Taiwan under the \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne Country, Two Systems\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy that has plummetted Hong Kong toward severe police repression of free speech: The U.S.-China trade dispute continues. And not far from Taiwan, Hong Kong is on the verge of chaos due to the failure of \u00e2\u0080\u009cone country, two systems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nevertheless, China is still threatening to impose its \u00e2\u0080\u009cone country, two systems model for Taiwan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Their diplomatic offensives and military coercion pose a serious challenge to regional stability and peace. My fellow citizens, when freedom and democracy are challenged, and when the Republic of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existence and development are threatened, we must stand up and defend ourselves. The overwhelming consensus among Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 23 million people is our rejection of \u00e2\u0080\u009cone country, two systems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d regardless of party affiliation or political position. The Republic of China has stood tall on Taiwan for over 70 years. But if we were to accept \u00e2\u0080\u009cone country, two systems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d there would no longer be room for the Republic of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existence. As President, standing up to protect national sovereignty is not a provocation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is my fundamental responsibility. Xi spoke last week on the dire occasion of the 70th anniversary of communist repression of China and declared that his regime seeks \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe complete reunification of the motherland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d including all ethnic Han Chinese people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must uphold the principles of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Peaceful Reunification\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098One Country, Two Systems,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 maintain lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao, promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, unite all Chinese sons and daughters, and continue to strive for the motherland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complete reunification,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Xi said. Xi added that the annexation of Taiwan was \u00e2\u0080\u009cinevitable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d American Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) was present in Taipei Thursday for National Day festivities, the first senator present in 35 years, according to Taipei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe also will stand up against Chinese efforts to undermine Taiwan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cruz told reporters, according to the Taipei Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a friendship that is incredibly important.

Both the credibility of the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his complaint have come in question as the officer was revealed as a registered Democrat with a previous \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofessional relationship\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a Democratic presidential candidate, while his accusations are based on secondhand information. His chief claim is that President Trump pressured Ukrainian President\u00c2\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky to look into allegations of corruption against former Vice President and White House hopeful Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Both President Trump and\u00c2\u00a0Zelensky have vehemently denied any pressured was applied and the White House released a transcript of their call to illustrate no wrongdoing occurred. As Breitbart News reported, questions regarding the Biden family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activities in Ukraine and China continue to swirl: In recent days, President Donald Trump has suggested China and Ukraine investigate alleged corruption committed by the Biden family.\u00c2\u00a0As Breitbart News extensively reported, Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment company scored a\u00c2\u00a0$1.5 billion investment deal\u00c2\u00a0with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013. Further,\u00c2\u00a0then-vice president\u00c2\u00a0Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating the gas giant Burisma Holdings, which was paying Hunter Biden $83,000 monthly as a member of its board, despite his lack of expertise in the energy sector. Biden later\u00c2\u00a0boasted\u00c2\u00a0before the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. The Fox News poll found 43 percent support the notion that President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments during the July 25th call with Zelensky were impeachable and 27 percent say that while they were inappropriate, they were not impeachable. Only 17 percent stated his comments were appropriate. The poll surveyed 1,003 registered voters and was conducted by telephone between October 6th-8th.",

According to WSBT22, Klopfer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family found\u00c2\u00a0the additional remains on Wednesday morning while searching through several of the abortionist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cars that were stored at a business property in Dolton, Illinois. #NEW: AG Hill says additional remains were found this morning by Will County Sheriff's office. The remains were found in a trunk at a business property in Dolton, Illinois. Investigators found five plastic bags and one box containing the fetal remains. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Max Lewis (@MaxLewisTV) October 9, 2019  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBased on that, the family members contacted authorities in Cook County,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hill. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCook County contacted Will County authorities primarily because Will County had experience, vast experience in establishing protocols from the last discovery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Arriving on the scene, investigators discovered five plastic bags and one box containing the remains of the aborted babies, stored in the trunk of an older Mercedes Benz. Klopfer performed abortions in South Bend, Gary and Fort Wayne, Indiana. In 2015, his medical license was suspended after he allegedly failed to report an abortion performed on a 13-year-old girl. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shock for everyone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hill said, adding his office is attempting to help Klopfer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former patients to determine if any of the remains discovered belong to them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur objective, ultimately, is to resolve this with respect and dignity for the remains and it would anticipate that we would add any additional new remains to the mix,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hill, according to the report. The priority, he continued, is giving the remains a \u00e2\u0080\u009cproper burial\u00e2\u0080\u009d and ensuring something like this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see fetal remains discarded like so much trash by the side of the road,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hill. \u00e2\u0080\u009cImagine, if you will, if we discovered 2,246 remains of adults who were deceased in some type of preservation fluid. Everyone would be freaking out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a comment sent to Breitbart News, Susan B. Anthony List\u00e2\u0080\u0099s State Policy Director\u00c2\u00a0Sue Swayze Liebel, an Indiana native,\u00c2\u00a0said the additional discovery is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca stark reminder that the abortion industry profits from the destruction of unborn children and exploitation of vulnerable women on a similar scale every day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe grieve for the little ones denied their very humanity and with the mothers forced to relive the trauma endured at Klopfer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands, wondering if their child is among his collection of bodies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of Klopfer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s victims deserved so much better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vice President Mike Pence, former Indiana governor, has called\u00c2\u00a0for a full investigation into the remains found at Klopfer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home.

We can also shy away from that truth out of our own sympathy for the 78-year-old. I know I feel for the guy. While I despise Bernie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s socialist policies and fascist vision of a one-government future, on a human level, no one wants to see anyone buckle to the inevitability of old age, if only because such a thing serves as a reminder of our own mortality. Here are the sad facts\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Bernie Sanders had a heart attack last week, and now he has announced he will be forced to slow down his campaign. And then he said he misspoke about slowing, and this whole mess can only mean one thing \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over.. Looking tired, defeated, and achingly mortal, Bernie told reporters outside his Vermont home,\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI certainly intend to be actively campaigning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we can change the nature of the campaign a bit, make sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said he had been doing \u00e2\u0080\u009cin some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to do that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Prior to last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart attack, Bernie was a force of nature, a 78-year-old out hustling, pressing the flesh, going a mile a minute with a mind as sharp as a tack. But 78 is still 78\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And no matter how fast you run, Father Time is going to catch up to a 78-year-old, and that is exactly what happened. So Bernie will march on, and good for him. He will want to push his issues, set the table with his agenda, speak at the Democrat convention\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But a man who has a heart attack while campaigning for president is not going to be president. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just too risky. Throwing up in Japan hurt President George H.W. Bush in 1992, age hurt Bob Dole in 1996, age and cancer concerns hurt John McCain in 2008, and Hillary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obvious health problems hurt her in 2016. If there is one thing Americans still agree on, it is that a president must be healthy, robust, virile, a physical dynamo. Bernie tried his best to prove he still was, but all he ended up proving is he is mortal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you know, just like the rest of us. Which brings me to Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Biden is only a year younger than Bernie and nowhere near as vigorous. Already, his eye has filled with blood on national TV, his dentures came loose during a national debate, and his schedule comes closer to banker hours than a man with the physicality required to run the free world. Due to his own health issues, his limited intelligence, his embrace of racists, his own racism, his own gaffes, and the fact that no amount of media spin can remove the layer of slime all over his son Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lucrative rent-seeking in Ukraine and China, he has collapsed in the polls. He is no longer the frontrunner. You know, it is as if the political gods are deliberately moving all the pieces into place to ensure clarifying the 2020 presidential election is between President Trump and a fake Indian slash socialist who wants to take away our health insurance, confiscate our guns, and replace us all with more compliant illegal aliens.

      "author": "AWR Hawkins",
      "content": " Author Miguel A. Faria, Jr., MD, a neurosurgeon by practice, has keen insight into the dangers facing freedom when those intent on restricting the Second Amendment do so under the banners of safety and healthcare, while enjoying deep financial backing. Faria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position is also informed by the fact he was once the editor of the Journal of the Medical Association of Georgia.\u00c2\u00a0He now uses his trained eye to parse medical journals and healthcare think tanks, warning freedom loving Americans of the dangers posed by doctors, especially large groups of doctors, who share a passion for gun control. For example, he discusses how the American Academy of Pediatrics (APA)\u00e2\u0080\u0093not exactly a group one might otherwise associate with gun control\u00e2\u0080\u0093was part of a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoalition\u00e2\u0080\u009d allegedly seeking \u00e2\u0080\u009ca variety of patient privacy-invading measures [in the early 21st century] in the name of gun safety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In another part of the book he stresses how certain \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublic health\u00e2\u0080\u009d hold to their biases to the point of skewing what their discoveries in favor of gun control. He does this by examining the pro-gun control findings of a 2002 study published in the Harvard School of Public Health\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Journal of Trauma.\u00c2\u00a0Faria wrote: Public health researchers ignored the beneficial aspects of gun ownership and concentrated only in obtaining supporting evidence for their long-known thesis that firearm availability is responsible for violence in our society. He also looks at a 2017 study published in Pediatrics, which included teenagers as old as 17 years in reporting 1,300 gun-related deaths of \u00e2\u0080\u009cchildren.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When Faria got into the numbers he saw, \u00e2\u0080\u009c78 percent of the deaths occurred among 13 to 17 year olds; 53 percent were homicides and 38 percent were suicides. Less than 12 percent were accidents involving children 12 or younger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In other words, the bulk of the homicides involved teenagers who were prime age for gang-related activity and street crime, while the actual group on which the study was ubiquitously focused\u00e2\u0080\u0093children\u00e2\u0080\u0093constituted only a small percentage of the deaths. Faria also uses America, Guns, and Freedom, to highlight the life-saving benefits of private gun ownership and concealed carry. He bolsters his examination of these things with the same enthusiasm that he showed in bolstering claims of bias and danger in \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublic health\u00e2\u0080\u009d gun control push. America, Guns, and Freedom, is a great read for anyone who wants to understand the myriad threats aligned against the right to keep and bear arms in the 21st century.

(The real reason is soil subsidence: but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suit the climate change narrative, obviously) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been caught data-tampering again to make \u00e2\u0080\u0098global warming\u00e2\u0080\u0099 look more \u00e2\u0080\u0098real\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and scary than it actually is. Disgraced climate \u00e2\u0080\u0098scientist\u00e2\u0080\u0099, fake Nobel prizewinner and failed litigant Michael Mann has been caught trying to erase from history the well-documented Medieval Warm Period (MWP) using \u00e2\u0080\u0098dubious, revisionist temperature data.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Why are Mann and his co-conspirator Katharine Hayhoe so keen to ditch the MWP? Because between 900 AD and 1200 AD, the world was at least as warm \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if not warmer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 than it is today. Yet there were no 4 x 4s or planes or factories \u00e2\u0080\u0098pumping out CO2\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to make this happen \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so gosh, what might this tell us about Anthropogenic Global Warming theory? The BBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only politically unbiased interviewer Andrew Neil has totally owned an Extinction Rebellion activist called Zion Lights. (He/she was presumably named after some kind of super potent indica/sativa hybrid you buy on the dark web). Having been Andrew Neiled myself, I do have a tiny smidgen of sympathy for Zion Lights. Except then again I totally don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m right on the No Deal Brexit thing whereas Zion Lights is totally wrong on her/his/its entire belief system. Extinction Rebellion crusties are currently trying to close down London City Airport. If you listened to Nick Robinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questions on the Today programme this morning \u00e2\u0080\u0094 my wife forced me to listen as I drove her to work because she hates me and because she wanted me to see just how much worse the BBC has got since I stopped listening to its drivel a year ago \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you would have got the impression that this is perfectly legit and that London City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Airport\u00e2\u0080\u0099s management really should be in the business of having to justify their core business (viz being an airport, where aeroplanes take off and land, with business people and holidaymakers inside) to tone deaf, left-biased BBC reporters.

Nothing that we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know already: that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bogus cause, invented by dodgy, activist scientists, propped up by mainstream media lies and hysteria and promoted by soap-dodging loons who are not only naive and ill-informed but outrageously hypocritical in the way that they want to end Western Civilisation but still somehow keep their mobile phones powered\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This is why I was so pleased to meet just about the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only sensible Greenie, Mike Shellenberger. Shellenberger used to be a deep green activist \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pushing heavily for renewables \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but then saw the light. He still cares about nature very much. But he thinks greenies like Extinction Rebellion are doing more harm than good. I asked him what the red-pill moment was that made him see the light. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo in the early 2000s I was the co-founder of our original Green New Deal. We called it the New Apollo Project. It was for a $300 billion investment in renewables. And we succeeded. We got President Obama, he did about $150 billion in renewables between 2007 and 2015 but right away we started running into big problems. The first you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all familiar with: unreliable electricity means you always have to have fossil fuel power plants backing up when the sun doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shine or the wind doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blow. But the other issue, which had a bigger impact on my heart, is the environmental impact of all those solar and wind farms. So you started having local conservationists raising concerns about the impacts of wind farms on bird and bat species; about the impact of solar farms on our desert tortoise. So you started having environmental consequences of renewables. I started running the numbers. It takes 150 times more land to get the same amount of electricity from a solar farm as from a nuclear plant; 17 times more materials are required for solar than for nuclear; and if you just total up all the used solar panel waste compared with nuclear, solar actually creates 300 times more toxic waste than nuclear. For me it was like, if I care about the environment, why are we not doing more nuclear power? Even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about climate change. Nuclear has the smallest environmental footprint because it has the highest energy density. So for me my red pill moment was realising that energy density determines environmental impact. A single coke can of uranium provides enough energy for my entire life. Whereas it would require many train cars full of coal, oil or gas; many more of renewables. So that for me was what made me change my mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was very impressed by Shellenberger (who, incidentally, may soon be running for Governor of California). You can hear more from him on my Delingpod podcast and vidcast next Thursday (details here).",

      "content": " Wednesday on Fox News Channel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cHannity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is now serving as legal counsel for President Donald Trump decried congressional procedure regarding impeachment and called the Salem Witch Trials a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfairer\u00e2\u0080\u009d process. He also laid details alleged Biden wrongdoing regarding high-ranking officials in Ukraine and urged viewers not just to keep an eye on China but Romania as well. Partial transcript as follows: GIULIANI: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all in here, Sean, a great letter by Pat Cipollone. It lays out about eight violations of the United States Constitution about six violations of the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s civil rights, my civil rights, Attorney General Barr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s civil rights. I never wanted in my life want to appear to at a Salem Witch Trial, which would actually be fairer than this. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a process without any due process and the fact it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being enabled by a completely corrupt press corps. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. Do you think we are going to hear on the press that a member of the parliament in Ukraine held a press conference today? The name was\u00c2\u00a0Andriy Derkach. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear this on the news, ladies, and gentlemen because they censor it. You only hear the news that Dems want you to hear. Derkach publicized documents which he said describe the mechanism getting money by Biden, Sr. This was a transfer of funds for lobbying activities as investigators believe to Joe Biden through a lobbying company. The funds and amount of $900,000, were transferred to the U.S. based company Rosemont Seneca which according to open sources, is affiliated with Biden. The payment reference was for consultative services. Then it goes on to describe another $16.5 million payment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 apparently laundered payment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 involving both Devon Archer and Hunter, using political and economic levers of power, influencing Ukrainian authorities, and manipulating the issue of providing financial aid, Joe Biden actively assisted closing criminal cases. This is based on a statement today by a parliament member in the Ukraine, a very senior one, saying that Joe Biden actively assisted closing criminal cases into the activity of former Ukrainian Ecology Minister Mykola Zlochevsky, who is the founder and owner of Burisma Group. Let me tell you who are Mykola Zlochevsky are. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a major oligarch. He stole $5 billion from his people. He very suspiciously was allowed to come back. His case got dismissed when they dismiss Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case,. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the guy who paid the $16.5 million and the $900,000 to the Bidens \u00e2\u0080\u0093 well, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t $16.5 [million]. It was more $8 million to the Biden group. This guy is one of the major criminals of the Ukraine, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now walking around free because Joe Biden got the case dismissed. This gentleman has said that this information should be turned over to the Department of Justice for their own purposes they should investigate it and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to tell you why Sean. Because they suspect that the President of the Ukraine received a very major bribe in order to tank this case. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying Biden was involved in the bride but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only thing he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involved in. This case stinks, they can run away from it all they want. Sean, I want to keep your eye, not just on China. I want you to keep your eye on Romania. Just watch Romania. HANNITY: Let me ask you this\u00e2\u0080\u0093 GIULIANI: You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read it in The New York Times or The Washington Post, but just watch Romania.

The former vice president even\u00c2\u00a0boasted\u00c2\u00a0to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role.) Meanwhile, former Vice President Biden has denied he or his son committed any wrongdoing, lashing out at a reporter when asked about the subject last week. During tense exchange at campaign stop in Los Angeles, the former vice president was pressed on whether Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, posed a conflict of interest while he was in government. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a conflict of interest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden scoffed, before raising his voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been no indication of any conflict of interest, from Ukraine or anywhere else, period. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to respond to that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on the problem, focus on this man, what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing, that no president has ever done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted while pointing his finger at the reporter.",

      "subtitle": "Drexel University has agreed to settle a lawsuit for $190,000 after one of its professors allegedly used federal funds to cover a decade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth of his spending habits at local strip clubs.",
      "author": "Alana Mastrangelo",
      "content": " Former professor and head of Drexel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engineering department Chikaodinaka \u00e2\u0080\u009cChika\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nwankpa spent \u00e2\u0080\u009chundreds of thousands\u00e2\u0080\u009d of federal research dollars over a ten-year period at local strip clubs, according to a report by\u00c2\u00a0the Philadelphia Inquirer. Now, the school has agreed to settle a lawsuit for $190,000 to pay back the money that was initially meant for\u00c2\u00a0energy, science, and naval research funding at Drexel. According to the report, Nwankpa was hardly covert when submitting his expenses reports, and had filed \u00e2\u0080\u009cseveral improper charges against his federal grants for \u00e2\u0080\u0098goods an services\u00e2\u0080\u0099 billed at \u00e2\u0080\u0098gentlemen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clubs\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0including Club Risque and Cheerleaders in South Philadelphia and the Tacony Club between 2007 and 2017.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In addition to strip clubs, Nwankpa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s improper charges also included sports bars and iTunes. After being confronted about his spending habits, the professor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who had spent 27 years teaching in Drexel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electrical and computer engineering department \u00e2\u0080\u0094 admitted to the illegitimate expenses, resigned, and agreed to pay $53,328, which was reportedly far less than his overall tab. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an example of flagrant and audacious fraud, and a shameful misuse of public funds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said U.S. Attorney William M. McSwain, whose office negotiated the settlement with Drexel. The report added that a university spokesperson said the school reported\u00c2\u00a0Nwankpa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suspicious spending and cooperated with the investigation into his misconduct. Drexel has reportedly since established additional training for faculty and staff and has revised its standards with regards to auditing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrexel\u00c2\u00a0takes allegations of unethical or unlawful business conduct on the part of any members of the university community very seriously and remains committed to being in full compliance with all billing regulations and requirements,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said spokesperson Niki Gianakaris, according to the\u00c2\u00a0Philadelphia Inquirer. The office for U.S. Attorney William M. McSwain mentioned that the settlement did not prevent the prosecution of Nwankpa.

      "author": "Ann Coulter",
      "content": " The \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersonal, political\u00e2\u0080\u009d angle is the last gasp of the impeachment hysterics. (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking at you, Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio), Susan Collins (Maine), Mitt Romney (Utah) and Ben Sasse (Nebraska).) Yes, Donald Trump is, technically, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpresident,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and, yes, former Vice President Joe Biden used his government position to withhold foreign aid until the president of Ukraine fired a prosecutor looking into a company paying Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drug addict son millions of dollars for mysterious reasons. But, the impeachment fanatics assert, by asking a foreign leader to assist in an otherwise legitimate corruption investigation, Trump has committed a monstrous crime \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because he was pursuing a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersonal political interest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To wit: Trump was trying to harm his political opponent, Joe Biden. Apart from the blindingly obvious fact that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t commit crimes and then escape justice simply by running for president, Democrats take official government action for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersonal, political\u00e2\u0080\u009d reasons all the time. Frequently, they do so for the sole purpose of harming their political opponents. President Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IRS investigated and harassed conservative groups for years, using the most fearsome arm of the government to punish political enemies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for personal, political reasons. Then his Department of Justice refused to prosecute the corrupt officials, which, I believe, was again for \u00e2\u0080\u0094 yes, it was personal, political reasons. How about the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endless investigations of Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson? As was obvious from the outset, Officer Wilson had done absolutely nothing wrong when he fatally shot Mike Brown \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something even Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corrupt, subpoena-defying attorney general, Eric Holder, had to concede after reviewing all the evidence. Those massive Department of Justice investigations were undertaken to gin up the Democratic base in order to help Hillary, who proceeded to honor Mike Brown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother on stage at the Democratic National Convention. In the most perfect example of a president demanding investigations for no other purpose than serving a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersonal, political\u00e2\u0080\u009d interest, in 1999, when Hillary was gearing up to run for the Senate from New York against Mayor Rudy Giuliani, President Bill Clinton (her husband) launched investigation after investigation into the crown jewel of the Giuliani administration, the NYPD. If President Clinton had actually cared about police brutality, there were dozens of police forces that should have been probed before he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever get to New York. Such as, for example, the city Bill and Hillary lived in. In 1999, as the NYPD was virtually eliminating crime in New York City, there were a grand total of 11 fatal shootings by police officers. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 0.28 fatal shootings for every 1,000 officers. In Washington, D.C., that year, there were four times as many fatal police shootings \u00e2\u0080\u0094 1.14 per 1,000 cops. In Houston, the number was 1.68. In San Diego, it was 4.36. In the end, Giuliani withdrew from the race to treat his prostate cancer, but when President Clinton was demanding these investigations, Rudy was crushing Hillary both in the polls and in political contributions. Speaking of whom, Hillary used her position as secretary of state to overthrow Libyan strongman Muammar Qaddafi, leading to the murder of a U.S. ambassador and several other Americans in Benghazi, as well as creating the refugee crisis currently engulfing Western Europe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all for her own personal, political reasons. As was dramatically revealed in Hillary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s email exchanges with her unofficial adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, her motive for deposing Qaddafi was to display her foreign policy chops, apart from that lunkhead Obama, who was, as Blumenthal sneered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cintent on seizing defeat from the jaws of victory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Blumenthal egged on Hillary to keep the pressure on Qaddafi, promising her a major political win. When Qaddafi was ousted, Blumenthal exulted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst, brava! You must go on camera. You must establish yourself in the historical record at this moment. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You are vindicated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Soon thereafter, Qaddafi was beaten to death in the desert by rebels who posted graphic video of the murder online. Cackling with delight at the initial reports, Hillary positioned herself alongside Julius Caesar: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe came. We saw. He died.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Most obviously, the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire illegal FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign was undertaken for personal, political purposes. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been waiting for three years to hear some legitimate reason for the FBI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surveillance of the Trump campaign. At this point, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair to say, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not getting one. The Obama administration spent millions of dollars and millions of man-hours on a purely political investigation to hurt Trump and help elect Hillary. As long as you mention it, the House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 investigation of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone call to the Ukrainian president has been undertaken for personal political reasons, too. So was Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s withholding of a $1 billion check from the president of Ukraine to protect his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleazy business deal. We can play the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersonal, political motive\u00e2\u0080\u009d game all day long! At least when Republicans do it, the Middle East doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explode in jihadist fury, the crime rate doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t skyrocket, people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t die or lose their livelihoods \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real corruption being exposed.",

The survey comes as House Democrats are attempting to move swiftly with an impeachment inquiry against President Trump that was launched in the wake of a partisan CIA officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d complaint claiming the president pressured the leader of Ukraine to look into allegations of corruption against\u00c2\u00a0former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Both presidents have denied any pressure was applied to probe Biden, and in a nod to transparency, the White House publically released a transcript of the world leaders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 July 25th conversation to show no wrongdoing occurred. President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Thursday comments are not the first time he has taken aim at Fox News.

      "author": "AWR Hawkins",
      "content": " He told\u00c2\u00a0NPR that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Constitution discriminates among weapons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thereby protecting ownership of some but not others. He suggested the Second Amendment does not allow citizens to \u00e2\u0080\u009cshoulder a bazooka,\u00e2\u0080\u009d nor does it protect ownership of AR-15s and AK-47s. He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the Second Amendment was adopted and ratified, it took three minutes to reload your musket. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that the Founding Fathers, the framers of the Constitution, those that pursued that Second Amendment \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 could have envisioned a weapon designed for war [being available to private citizens].\u00e2\u0080\u009d O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke overlooked a couple of important points. First, the military rifle he referenced is not a semiautomatic AR-15, which millions upon millions of Americans own and love, but a fully automatic M16 and/or M4. An AR-15 shoots one bullet per trigger pull, period, while an M-16 and/or M4 can shoot an entire magazine full of ammunition with a single pull of the trigger. (Some versions of the M4 only allow three-round bursts of full auto, but that is still a military option not available in civilian AR-15s.) The second fact O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke overlooks is muskets in private possession when the Second Amendment was ratified were military weapons. It was with such muskets that Patriots throughout southern colonies repelled and ultimately defeated the invading British Red Coats. The National Shooting Sports Foundation calculates there are more than\u00c2\u00a016 million\u00c2\u00a0privately owned AR-15s in the United States.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The Biden campaign sent its letter to Baquet Wednesday, expressing outrage for printing \u00e2\u0080\u009ca baseless conspiracy theory\u00e2\u0080\u009d and calling Schweizer, author of the book\u00c2\u00a0Secret Empires,\u00c2\u00a0a \u00e2\u0080\u009cright wing polemicist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While half of Schweizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s op-ed in\u00c2\u00a0the Times addressed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao\u00e2\u0080\u0099s China ties, the Biden campaign did not seem to take issue with that particular coverage. In the op-ed, Schweizer wrote: In December 2013, Joe and Hunter Biden\u00c2\u00a0flew aboard Air Force Two to China; less than two weeks after the trip, Hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners, which he founded with two other businessmen in June 2013, finalized a deal to open a fund, BHR Partners, whose largest shareholder is the government-run Bank of China, even though he had scant background in private equity.(Representatives of the fund claim that the timing of the deal and the Bidens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trip to China was coincidental). Thus far, the firm has invested about $2.1 billion, according to its website. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 With the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, Joe Biden became point person in Ukraine as well. That same year, Hunter Biden landed a board position with the Ukrainian energy giant Burisma Holdings. Despite having no background in energy or Ukraine, the vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son was paid as much as $50,000 a month, according to financial records. (He left the board in early 2019). \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The Bidens are hardly alone. President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, and her husband, Senator Mitch McConnell, are being accused of having profited from their commercial ties to Beijing. In 2004, the two had a net worth of about $3.1 million, according to public disclosures. Three years later,\u00c2\u00a0the range was\u00c2\u00a0$3.1 million to $12.7 million. The next year, their net worth rocketed to $7.3 million to $33.1 million. The Biden campaign responded to the bombshell op-ed in protest, calling the paper either \u00e2\u0080\u009cblind\u00e2\u0080\u009d or deceptively sensationalist:  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever, it is because of the critical role in our memory, the foundations of which are under assault, that we write to protest how little the New York Times has internalized the sobering lessons of 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly after giving top billing today to discredited right wing polemicist Peter Schweizer just this morning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield wrote, adding that the outlet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to feature the op-ed was \u00e2\u0080\u009chardly the first example.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign accused the Times of spreading \u00e2\u0080\u009ca baseless conspiracy theory advanced by Rudy Giuliani,\u00e2\u0080\u009d referencing the former vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma holdings, where Hunter Biden was taking in thousands of dollars per month. Biden bragged about threatening to withhold military aid during an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations last year and jovially stated, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, son of a bitch. He got fired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Neither\u00c2\u00a0Secret Empires\u00c2\u00a0nor Schweizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s op-ed attack Biden on this point, yet the campaign appears to believe so. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis debunked theory speculates that then Vice-President Biden somehow did anything reportedly inappropriate in successfully ridding Ukraine of a corrupt prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who the Times itself thoroughly explained at the time was derelict and the target of an international effort for removal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bedingfield wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was especially troubling about the Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s active participation in this smear campaign is that prior to its reporting on the subject by Ken Vogel,\u00c2\u00a0 this conspiracy had been relegated to the likes of Breitbart, Russia propaganda, and another conspiracy theorist, regular Hannity guest John Solomon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she argued. Bedingfield accused the\u00c2\u00a0Times\u00c2\u00a0of unfairly covering Biden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis leaves us with a critical question: are you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016, or are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, ultimately demanding that the Times\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cpublicly answer for these failures in reporting on this pressing issue fairly\u00e2\u0080\u009d and calling for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublic editor\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the paper. A Times spokesperson responded to the letter, maintaining that the outlet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coverage has been \u00e2\u0080\u009cfair and accurate\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\u00c2\u00a0adding that it will \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy to sit down with Biden advisers anytime to discuss news coverage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the spokesperson added: ",

      "author": "Kristina Wong",
      "content": " Gabbard said in a video she tweeted that she has met Democrat voters in Iowa and New Hampshire who have expressed frustration to her that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cDNC and the corporate media are essentially trying to usurp\u00e2\u0080\u009d their role as voters in choosing who the next Democrat presidential nominee will be. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow the 2016 Democratic Primary election was rigged by the DNC and their partners in the corporate media against Bernie Sanders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this 2020 election, the DNC and the corporate media are rigging the election again but this time it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s against the American people in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. She said: They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re attempting to replace the roles of voters in the early states using polling and other arbitrary methods which are not transparent or democratic and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re holding so-called debates which really are not debates at all but rather commercialized reality television meant to entertain, rather than inform or enlighten. So in short, the DNC and the corporate media are trying to hijack the entire election process. So in order to bring attention to this serious threat to our democracy, and to ensure your voice is heard, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m seriously considering boycotting the next debate on October 15th. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to announce my decision within the next few days.  Follow Breitbart News\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0@Kristina_Wong.",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The dust-up started when the Biden campaign sent a letter to the Times\u00c2\u00a0lambasting the outlet for running an opinion piece by Schweizer detailing the numerous instances in which the former vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political influence seemed to intersect with the business dealings of his youngest son, Hunter. The letter, which was authored by deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, accused the Times of not having \u00e2\u0080\u009cinternalized the sobering lessons of 2016\u00e2\u0080\u009d by giving \u00e2\u0080\u009ctop billing\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cright-wing polemicist\u00e2\u0080\u009d like Schweizer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision is hardly the first example,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bedingfield wrote, before proceeding to claim the Times\u00c2\u00a0had an \u00e2\u0080\u009coutsized hand in the spread of a baseless conspiracy theory\u00e2\u0080\u009d concerning the Biden family.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was especially troubling about the Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s active participation in this smear campaign is that prior to its reporting\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this conspiracy had been relegated to the likes of\u00c2\u00a0Breitbart,\u00c2\u00a0Russian propaganda, and another conspiracy theorist, regular\u00c2\u00a0Hannity\u00c2\u00a0guest\u00c2\u00a0John Solomon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Times\u00c2\u00a0did not take kindly to the accusation, telling CNN in a statement that its prior \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoverage of the Biden campaign and Hunter Biden has been fair and accurate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0The outlet further added it would \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy to sit down with Biden advisers anytime to discuss news coverage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On the topic of Schweizer, the Times\u00c2\u00a0defended its decision to publish his op-ed, noting that, far from being a \u00e2\u0080\u009cright-wing polemicist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he had expertise in ethics and public corruption through his position as president of the Government Accountability Institute. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe op-ed makes an argument that nonpartisan government watchdogs would make, arguing in favor of a law that would prohibit self-dealing by those with government connections,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a spokesperson for the paper said. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attack on the Times comes as his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business dealings have spilled into the open amid the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Schweizer, who previously chronicled the troubling fundraising practices of the Clinton Foundation, has been at the forefront of the topic since the publication of his bestselling\u00c2\u00a0book\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in 2018. In particular, Schweizer has exposed how Hunter Biden profited off deals with Ukraine and China that appeared inaccessible to average American businessmen, at the same time his father was responsible for helping formulate the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy towards both countries.",

      "content": " Reuters reports\u00c2\u00a0that Sen. Marco Rubio has called on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to review the acquisition of social media app Musical.ly by TikTok owner Beijing ByteDance Technology Co. over claims that TikTok is used by the Chinese government to censor certain political content. Rubio stated in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that Chinese-owned apps\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009care increasingly being used to censor content and silence open discussion on topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese Government and Communist Party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\u00c2\u00a0Treasury secretary heads the CFIUS, which reviews mergers such as that of Musical.ly and TikTok to ensure that they do not damage national security. Rubio stated that there was evidence that TikTok in the United States was censoring political content that was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in line\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the Chinese government. Rubio stated that China\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cis using these apps to advance their foreign policy and globally suppress freedom of speech, expression, and other freedoms that we as Americans so deeply cherish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In one example, TikTok has blacklisted popular Christian app pray.com from advertising on its app. A spokesperson for TikTok clarified tha the firm stores all of its U.S. user data in the United States.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content, and would not have jurisdiction regardless, as TikTok does not operate there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the spokesperson stated. David Hanke, an attorney with Arent Fox who helped craft a legislative overhaul of the committee last year, stated that\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be shocking, but it would be atypical,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for CFIUS to review the merger. He added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt also would not be the first time CFIUS has blazed new trails over China-specific concerns.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ByteDance purchased Musical.ly for almost $1 billion in December 2017, eventually shutting the app down and revamping its own TikTok app to replace it. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original app is called Douyin and is similar to TikTok but is only available in China where it complies with local censorship laws.

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " So, uhm, what happened to the badass who took on Corn Pop? What happened to the tough guy who was going to beat President Trump like a drum? What happened to the sunglasses and swagger? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you what happened\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Joe Biden got old. And I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean number-wise. While Clint Eastwood is still knocking them out of the park at age 89, Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye is exploding, his dentures are falling out, and now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranting and raving at the refs because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s losing the game. On Thursday, the far-left New York Times published an op-ed written by Breitbart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own Peter Schweizer, author of the recent bestseller Secret Empires. In the piece, Schweizer uses Biden and Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) as an example of why Congress must pass reforms closing the \u00e2\u0080\u009cglaring loophole [that] provide political families with an opportunity to effectively \u00e2\u0080\u0098offshore\u00e2\u0080\u0099 corruption and cronyism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d About Biden, Schweizer lays out the devastating facts: As vice president, Joe Biden served as point person on American policy toward China and Ukraine. In both instances, his son Hunter, a businessman, landed deals\u00c2\u00a0he\u00c2\u00a0was apparently\u00c2\u00a0unqualified to\u00c2\u00a0score save for one thing: his father. In December 2013, Joe and Hunter Biden\u00c2\u00a0flew aboard Air Force Two to China; less than two weeks after the trip, Hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners, which he founded with two other businessmen in June 2013, finalized a deal to open a\u00c2\u00a0fund, BHR Partners,\u00c2\u00a0whose largest shareholder is the\u00c2\u00a0government-run Bank of China, even though\u00c2\u00a0he had scant background\u00c2\u00a0in private equity.\u00c2\u00a0(Representatives of the fund claim that the timing of the deal and the Bidens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trip to China was coincidental.)\u00c2\u00a0Thus far, the firm\u00c2\u00a0has invested about $2.1 billion,\u00c2\u00a0according to its website. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 With the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, Joe Biden became point person in Ukraine as well. That same year, Hunter Biden\u00c2\u00a0landed a board position\u00c2\u00a0with the Ukrainian energy giant Burisma Holdings. Despite having no background in energy or Ukraine, the vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son was paid\u00c2\u00a0as much as\u00c2\u00a0$50,000 a month, according to financial records. (He left the board in early 2019.) Why would someone with so little experience be able to command such enormous payments? Joe Biden recently claimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Hunter Biden admitted to The New Yorker\u00c2\u00a0that on one occasion, they had in fact discussed his work for Burisma[.] Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response\u00e2\u0080\u00a6? He ran out on his front lawn, shook his fist at the sky, and started yelling at the Times. In a letter addressed to Times executive editor Dean Baquet, Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputy campaign manager and comms director Kate Bedingfield freaked out. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a taste: What was especially troubling about the Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s active participation in this smear campaign is that prior to its reporting on the subject by Ken Vogel, this conspiracy had been relegated to the likes of Breitbart, Russian propaganda, and another conspiracy theorist, regular Hannity guest John Solomon. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Despite voluminous work done by the independent press and fact-checkers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including some by The Times \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to refute the heinous conspiracy theory that Donald Trump attempted to bully Ukraine into propping-up for him, the paper ran an op-ed by none other than Peter Schweizer, making more malicious claims about the Biden family. This leaves us with a critical question: are you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016, or are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it? How sad is that? Biden tried to do the same with Facebook and Twitter after the Trump campaign started running ads about Biden and Ukraine. Twitter has so far said nothing. Facebook told Biden to go pound sand, as did the Times, which released a statement defending the Schweizer op-ed. But is this the behavior of a tough guy? Is this the behavior of a man or a mouse \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a mouse with something to hide? If Biden was an actual tough guy, if he still had The Stuff to be president, he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be crybabying to the refs to stop the fight and declare him the winner. \u00c2\u00a0If Biden were the swaggering badass he claims to be, he would be out there fighting, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be sticking it right back to Trump. Most importantly, he would come out of hiding to address this scandal head on \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you know, like a man. Nothing proves this Ukraine scandal is the real deal more than Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cowardice when it comes to addressing it. Even if a reporter is able to ask him a question about the ridiculous amount of money his son was paid by a Ukrainian energy company, Biden just freaks out. Instead of answering the question, he acts like the reporter just skipped in front of him in line at the Blue Plate Special \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he starts screaming and crybabying about how the question isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. Listen, if there were a legitimate reason Hunter Biden was paid $50,000 a month \u00e2\u0080\u0094a month! \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by this company, Biden would have already sat down for an extensive interview to lay it all out, or he would have called a press conference to answer all questions. Instead, he is hiding his son in some undisclosed location, when he should have Hunter doing the interview rounds in defense of his own business practices and honor. But Biden can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that because there are no good answers, so the old man has been reduced to a big whiner, and like a spoiled child caught red-handed, he only has one option: temper tantrums where he screams, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, you shut up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Sassoli was backed by\u00c2\u00a0Am\u00c3\u00a9lie de Montchalin, Europe minister under French president Emmanuel Macron, who said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there are new elections or a new referendum, if there is a political shift leading us to believe we could have a different dialogue from the one we have today, then an extension can be discussed\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 strongly suggesting that the EU is no longer seeking a mutually agreeable deal with Boris Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government, but merely waiting for him to be ousted or politically neutered.

Elsewhere, he advocated remaining subject to the bloc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Customs Union, dismissing the opportunities which could arise from an independent trade policy and pursuing new deals with countries such as the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, leading anti-Brexit campaigner and former prime minister Tony Blair is also opposed to finding out whether or not the Leave-voting British people support Remainer MPs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 manifesto-breaking actions in a fresh election. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the reason for not having a general election is that if you want to resolve Brexit and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deadlock in Parliament, and Parliament can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree over Brexit and therefore you have to go back to the people to break the deadlock, then a general election in my view is the wrong way to decide that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the unpopular Iraq War architect, somewhat nonsensically. Blair, who has held meetings with the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team and billionaire plutocrat George Soros, who has been financing the anti-Brexit movement, throughout the Brexit negotiations, suggested that the correct course would be to make the British people vote on Brexit again, giving Remain a second chance to win \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even though it is not the decision to leave the EU which is in doubt, but the way Parliament is (not) implementing it. In any case, senior Remain MPs such as Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson have said they would continue to defy the will of the people on Brexit even if they voted for it a second time. ",

The comment comes a day after she declared impeachment the \u00e2\u0080\u009conly appropriate remedy\u00e2\u0080\u009d to address the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cunconstitutional abuse of power, his contempt of Congress, and his obstruction of justice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Clinton told a Washington, DC, crowd during a stop on her Gutsy Women tour that \u00e2\u0080\u009cforeign governments think they can tilt the playing field\u00e2\u0080\u009d as they did against her and claimed that Republicans are generally OK with it:  If foreign governments think they can tilt the playing field as they did against me, which was a deliberate, well planned out effort laid out in an indictments against Russian military actors and their allies\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Well, you know, Republicans seem to think that, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ok, so far Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing on the red team.

Her increased appearances and remarks have been driving speculation that former Democrat nominee is considering another presidential bid.

Brexiteers like Nigel Farage had long maintained an exit on the May withdrawal treaty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terms would be tantamount to a surrender to the EU, and much less desirable\u00c2\u00a0than a no-deal break ending the supremacy of the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laws, courts, rules, and regulations.  Writing in response to a Downing Street briefing released earlier this week which portrayed a full, no-deal Brexit as a certainty overnight, Farage said he \u00e2\u0080\u009cwelcome[d] the Prime Minister standing up to German bullying and showing genuine determination to get Brexit done. But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust his party, at all, on this issue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fresh briefings from Downing Street published as Mr Farage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s musings went live seem to appear to suggest he was right to offer that closing disclaimer, as the Prime Minister has moved to mollify Remain-voting Tory MPs by promising he would not explicitly endorse a no-deal Brexit. The Times reported Thursday that Boris Johnson himself had moved to rule out fighting a general election on the principle of a full, no-deal Brexit if a deal couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be reached, the paper quoting his remarks that he \u00e2\u0080\u009cpassionately\u00e2\u0080\u009d wanted to strike a deal and had \u00e2\u0080\u009cno intention\u00e2\u0080\u009d of making a commitment otherwise. The remarks may indicate that the Prime Minister is moving towards the position once held by Theresa May, of striking a deal at almost any cost. ",

Most recently, Remainers also argue the country needs a second referendum in case Britons have changed their minds. One common statement is that Britons did not vote to leave the Single Market \u00e2\u0080\u0094 despite Nick Clegg, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, and David Cameron having said many times during the 2016 campaign that that would be the case. Mr Cameron, who backed Remain, had said voting to leave the EU meant voting to leave the Single Market at least 28 times. When BBC journalist Andrew Neil confronted Mr Clegg on the fact, he could not refute it. Instead, the former Liberal Democrat leader shifted to the accusation of voter ignorance, saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t watch the interviews between you and me.

      "author": "Tom Ciccotta",
      "content": " According to a press release, Oberlin College has assembled a team of high-profile attorneys to challenge the outcome of its high profile defamation case. In the case, an Ohio jury ruled that Oberlin College should pay $25 million over the college\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in a smear campaign against local business Gibson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bakery. Breitbart News has reported extensively on Gibson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bakery\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal battle with Oberlin College. Gibson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bakery sued the college after administrators engaged in a smear campaign against the bakery, calling it \u00e2\u0080\u009cracist\u00e2\u0080\u009d over an incident at the bakery that involved two black Oberlin students. The problem? Both students admitted in a court of law that race did not play a role in the shopkeeper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to their shoplifting attempt. Oberlin argues that the verdict poses a threat to the First Amendment. Oberlin hired First Amendment attorneys\u00c2\u00a0Lee Levine and Seth Berlin, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, to defend them in the upcoming appeal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe verdict and judgment in this case set a precedent that endangers free speech on campuses and for all Americans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Levine said in a comment used in the press release. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe jury was allowed to award substantial damages for speech that is protected by the Constitution. The case should absolutely be reviewed by an appellate court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Benjamin Sass\u00c3\u00a9, an appellate attorney who will also work with Oberlin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal team, argues that Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s free speech protections should have kept the case out of court from the beginning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis case never should have gone to the jury in light of the heightened speech protections in the Ohio Constitution, and the trial court made several procedural errors during trial that led to this verdict.\u00c2\u00a0 Among other things, those errors prevented jurors from hearing critical information about the original incident,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sass\u00c3\u00a9 said in a short comment. Gibson Bakery\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney Lee Plakas has a different perspective on the case. Plakas argued this week that Oberlin is \u00e2\u0080\u009chiding behind\u00e2\u0080\u009d the First Amendment as a means of defending their abuse of Gibson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bakery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe jury\u00e2\u0080\u0099s verdict sent a clear message that institutions like Oberlin College should not be permitted to bully others while hiding behind the claimed shield of free speech,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Plakas told a local reporter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are no exemptions from the law of defamation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a fact we trust will be confirmed during the appeal process.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.",

      "author": "Sean Moran",
      "content": " Hagerty has raised nearly $2 million since he first launched his campaign for Senate on September 9, which amounts to just 22 days in his third-quarter fundraising. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChrissy and I are deeply humbled by the support our campaign has earned so far,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0said Hagerty in a statement Thursday.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ready to fight for your family in the U.S. Senate, and this support is essential as we work to share my conservative vision for our state and our country. We will continue to talk with Tennesseans about\u00c2\u00a0how I can best serve them in the Senate and fight to pass President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agenda.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hagerty has emerged as an early favorite to replace the retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) when President Trump endorsed him in July.  Hagerty wrote in an exclusive op-ed for Breitbart News in September that he will fight for President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s America First agenda and against Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 open border policies. He charged: But no single issue more clearly highlights their extremism than the left\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans to radically transform our immigration system. Last year, they were calling to abolish ICE. This year they are calling for open borders. These liberal Democrats are seeking to decriminalize illegal immigration. If that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough, they are incentivizing illegal immigration by offering illegal aliens everything from free college to free health care \u00e2\u0080\u0094 putting illegal aliens in line ahead of your family and our veterans. And \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Squad\u00e2\u0080\u009d has piled on saying that taxpayers should fund abortions for illegal aliens too. As I seek to represent Tennesseans in the United States Senate, one of my top priorities will be standing strong with President Trump against the Democrats and their liberal socialist agenda. I will fight to preserve freedom and opportunity for my children and yours, because the threat these radical liberals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and socialists \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pose to the American way of life we know and love is real. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must do everything we can to fight back, and that begins with sending President Donald J. Trump back to the White House for four more years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded. Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @SeanMoran3.",

      "subtitle": "Cornell Law School professor\u00c2\u00a0Josh Chafetz\u00c2\u00a0wrote in a Thursday\u00c2\u00a0New York Times op-ed that House Democrats should consider arresting associates of President Donald Trump and his\u00c2\u00a0administration officials to move forward with an impeachment inquiry.",
      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " On Tuesday, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sent a scathing letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) stating it refuses to cooperate with Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 impeachment probe, blasting it as \u00e2\u0080\u009cillegitimate\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cunconstitutional\u00e2\u0080\u009d and an attempt to\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009coverturn the results\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the 2016 presidential election. According to\u00c2\u00a0Chafetz, if Trump officials and members of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inner circle refuse to comply with the inquiry, House Democrats should consider deploying its\u00c2\u00a0sergeant-at-arms to take them into custody and jail them in \u00e2\u0080\u009cmakeshift\u00e2\u0080\u009d cells on Capitol Hill: The House should instead put back on the table the option of using its sergeant-at-arms to arrest contemnors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as the person in violation of the order is called \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially when an individual, like Rudy Giuliani, is not an executive branch official. Neither house of Congress has\u00c2\u00a0arrested anyone\u00c2\u00a0since 1935, but it was not uncommon before that point (and was\u00c2\u00a0blessed\u00c2\u00a0by the Supreme Court in 1927). Indeed, on at least two occasions,\u00c2\u00a0the second in 1916, a house of Congress had its sergeant arrest an executive branch official. (In that case, the Supreme Court eventually\u00c2\u00a0ruled\u00c2\u00a0against the House, not because it did not have the power to arrest for contempt, but rather because the offense \u00e2\u0080\u0094 writing a nasty public letter to a House subcommittee \u00e2\u0080\u0094 could not properly be understood as contempt of Congress.) Facilities in the Capitol or one of the House office buildings can be made into a makeshift holding cell if necessary. Of course, arrestees will ask the courts to set them free, but the case should be relatively open-and-shut against them: They will have committed a contempt in refusing to turn over subpoenaed materials, and the House has the power to hold contemnors. Moreover, time would work in the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favor here: The unpleasantness of being in custody while the issue was being litigated might make some contemnors decide to cooperate. Chafetz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s op-ed comes after\u00c2\u00a0far-left \u00e2\u0080\u009cSquad\u00e2\u0080\u009d member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) claimed House Democrat colleagues are exploring ways to arrest White House officials who refuse to comply with subpoenas as part of their inquiry probe. Addressing constituents at a town hall in her hometown of Detriot, Tlaib said Democrats are mulling over how to arrest Cabinet secretaries and other Trump administration officials. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the first time we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever had a situation like this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tlaib said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to figure out, no joke, is it the D.C. police that goes and gets them? We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.

      "content": " The Campaign Legal Center, a transparency advocacy group, filed a complaint against the two men with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in July 2018, accusing them of violating campaign finance laws by using an LLC to hide the source of their donations, according to the Wall Street Journal. In May 2018, they gave $325,000 to the primary pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action, through Global Energy Partners LLC, according to the WSJ. A spokeswoman for American First Action told the WSJ they had put the donation in a segregated bank account filing the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint and said it \u00e2\u0080\u009chas not been used for any purpose and the funds will remain in this segregated account until these matters are resolved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The men have donated just over $500,000 in the past three years, including to Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), the National Republican Congressional Committee, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), according to the WSJ. They are expected to appear in federal court in Virginia on Thursday. Both are being represented by John Dowd, the former head of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s White House legal team. The two men are reportedly both clients of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer Rudy Giuliani and had separately assisted him in efforts to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the WSJ. The two men are reportedly born in former Soviet republics, but which ones have not been specified. The WSJ report cites information from a Soros-funded group, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), alleging that the men had dinner with the president in May 2018 and later that month met with Donald Trump Jr. The two men reportedly introduced Giuliani to several current and former senior Ukrainian prosecutors to discuss Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case beginning late 2018, and House Democrats have sought documents and depositions from them since last month. The WSJ also reported that Parnas and Fruman allegedly worked to oust the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who was removed from her post earlier this year. The paper also reported that both men told the Soros-funded group OCCRP that they told Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) that Yovanovitch was bad-mouthing Trump, and Sessions reportedly asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for her removal. Sessions did not confirm that to the WSJ. On Thursday, House Democrats subpoenaed the men to appear before Congress in their impeachment inquiry against Trump.  Follow Breitbart News\u00e2\u0080\u0099s @Kristina_Wong.",

      "content": " Deadline reported that\u00c2\u00a0former Vice President Biden will attend two Hollywood fundraisers on Thursday \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one in the afternoon hosted by former HBO executive\u00c2\u00a0Michael Lombardo,\u00c2\u00a0and one in the evening at the home of Paramount Pictures chairman and CEO Jim Gianopulos. CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s town hall, titled Equality in America,\u00c2\u00a0is set to air Thursday evening, from\u00c2\u00a07:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. ET, and will feature nine Democratic presidential candidates. The event is co-organized by the\u00c2\u00a0Human Rights Campaign Foundation, a non-profit focused on LGBTQ issues. The town hall comes amidst increased U.S.-China tensions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a subject that hits close to home in the entertainment industry, \u00c2\u00a0which depends heavily on Chinese consumers to buy movie tickets and visit theme parks. Hollywood executives have remained conspicuously quiet about U.S.-China relations in the wake of democracy protests in Hong Kong that have put global businesses including the NBA to Apple in a difficult spot. President Donald Trump has publicly hammered Biden over his close ties with China, accusing the former Vice President and his son, Hunter,\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0of being \u00e2\u0080\u009cpaid off\u00e2\u0080\u009d by foreign interests. Moderators of Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s town hall include CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dana Bash, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon and Nia-Malika Henderson. Sen. Harris (D-CA) reportedly attended a reception at The Abbey in West Hollywood on Wednesday, while\u00c2\u00a0Buttigieg is set to attend a fundraiser at the Belasco Theater in downtown L.A. Deadline reported earlier this week that Buttigieg\u00c2\u00a0attended a separate L.A. fundraiser on Tuesday at the home of former CAA agent Michael Kives, who is now head of the investment advisory firm K5 Global. Celebrities who were reportedly in attendance include Leonardo DiCaprio, Glenn Close, Ashton Kutcher and Paris Hilton. Hollywood is a reliable fundraising pitstop for Democratic candidates. Hillary Clinton made numerous L.A. visits in her failed 2016 bid for the White House, including events with mega donor and billionaire Haim Saban, the founder of Saban Entertainment. CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s town hall is set to take place at the Novo, at the\u00c2\u00a0L.A. Live complex in downtown L.A. Other Democratic presidential hopefuls scheduled to appear include Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Beto O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00c3\u00a1n Castro,\u00c2\u00a0Tom Steyer and\u00c2\u00a0Sen.

      "content": " Cotton accused Atkinson of stonewalling the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee while giving more details to the House Intelligence Committee \u00e2\u0080\u0094 chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who has been a central player in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d complaint and his party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. The Federalist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sean Davis explains\u00c2\u00a0the ongoing scandal over the complaint \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including claims that Atkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office eliminated the requirement for \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblowers\u00e2\u0080\u009d to have a first-hand account of any wrongdoing and \u00e2\u0080\u009cbackdated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or\u00c2\u00a0falsely documented, the change occurring earlier than it actually did: Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general, told HPSCI lawmakers during a committee oversight hearing on Friday that the whistleblower forms and rules changes were made in September, even though the new forms and guidance, which were not uploaded to the ICIG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website until September 24, state that they were changed in August. Despite having a full week to come up with explanations for his office\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decisions to secretly change its forms to eliminate the requirement for first-hand evidence and to backdate those changes to August, Atkinson refused to provide any explanation to lawmakers baffled by his behavior. When pressed on the curious changes and attempts to obscure the timeline of his revisions, Atkinson refused to explain why the forms were backdated to August even though they were not made until September. The ICIG previously stated that it changed its forms and guidance \u00e2\u0080\u009cin response to recent press inquiries regarding\u00e2\u0080\u009d the anti-Trump complaint, of which Congress was not even notified until the second week of September. The new forms, which were not uploaded to the ICIG website until September 24, nonetheless stated that the revisions were made back in August. Cotton, who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, all but accused Atkinson of obstructing justice by dodging questions on the issue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour disappointing testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on September 26 was evasive to the point of being insolent and obstructive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespite repeated questions, you refused to explain what you meant in your written report by \u00e2\u0080\u0098indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cotton continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis information is, of course, unclassified and we were meeting in a closed setting. Yet you moralized about how you were duty bound not to share even a hint of this political bias with us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut now I see media reports that you revealed to the House Intelligence Committee not only that the complainant is a registered Democrat, but also that he has a professional relationship with a Democratic presidential candidate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cotton wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m dissatisfied, to put it mildly, with your refusal to answer my questions, while more fully briefing the three-ring circus that the House Intelligence Committee has become.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This report comes from the Washington Examiner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Byron York, who was told Atkinson testified to the House Intel Committee that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d had \u00e2\u0080\u009csome type of professional relationship\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a Democratic presidential candidate. Before this story broke, CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jake Tapper tried to dampen the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartisan\u00e2\u0080\u009d label that has stuck to this individual \u00e2\u0080\u0094 reportedly a CIA official \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by saying it was based only on his or her registration as a Democratic voter.  Cotton closed out his letter to Atkinson by posing a series of questions: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you or anyone subject to your control or influence share with CNN that the \u00e2\u0080\u0098arguable political bias\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was merely that the complainant is a registered Democrat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked. Cotton also asked Atkinson to disclose the Democratic presidential candidate with whom the complainant has a professional relationship and\u00c2\u00a0asked him to respond to the letter by 5 p.m. on Friday, October 11.

      "subtitle": "We may have finally found a consumer good whose prices were driven higher by China tariffs: bicycles.",
      "author": "John Carney",
      "content": " For the most part, U.S. consumers are not paying for the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tariffs with higher prices on goods. The Consumer Price Index was flat in September, the Department of Labor said Thursday. Compared with a year ago, prices rose just 1.7 percent, matching August and below expectations for 1.8 percent gain. After taking out volatile food and energy prices, inflation ran at 0.1 percent for the month and 2.4 percent for the year, a deceleration from August\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 0.3 percent monthly gain. As Breitbart has been reporting for over a year now, the prices of most items subject to the steel, aluminum, and China tariffs show no significant tariff pressure. But in May, the China tariff on bicycles rose from 10 percent to 25 percent. That is on top of the pre-existing bicycle tariff that has been in place since imposed by President John F. Kennedy, recently around 11 percent (down from Kennedy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 25 percent). The price of bicycles and sports vehicles jumped 3 percent higher in September\u00e2\u0080\u0093perhaps indicating a lag effect\u00e2\u0080\u0093and it is now 5.8 percent higher than a year ago. It is not totally clear that this has been caused by tariffs or which tariffs caused the price hike. Steel and aluminum tariffs may have contributed. The direct tariff on Chinese made bikes, which make up around half the imported bicycles in the U.S., is the most likely candidate. Despite the lack of a widespread tariff effect, special interest groups and media outlets continue to insist that prices are rising. Just a few days before the September CPI data was released, Foreign Affairs magazine claimed\u00c2\u00a0that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe tariffs have hit U.S. consumers harder than their Chinese counterparts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Federal Reserve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s monetary policy committee says it targets inflation at the rate of 2 percent. But the index the Fed uses, called the personal consumption expenditure index, runs about a half a point or so below the better-known consumer price index. Which means that inflation is likely running below the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s target. In other words, even with the tariffs the Trump administration has imposed, consumer prices are rising by less than the Fed thinks is consistent with price stability. It is theoretically possible prices would be rising at an even slower rate than they are if the tariffs were not in place. But that would only mean the Fed would have to work harder to push them back toward the target. The data defy the dire predictions of experts who forecast consumers would foot the bill for tariffs. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, however, said all of these predictions of higher prices were wrong. To the contrary, Ross argued tariffs would have little to no effect on U.S. consumers. He held up cans of Campbell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soup and Budweiser beer to illustrate his point that the metals input into most consumer prices was very low and prices were unlikely to rise. When prices did not rise as predicted, the critics did not back off their claims. Many just moved the time frame, arguing that the forecast price increases were just taking time to move through the economy. But with each passing month, that an increasingly absurd position. Car and truck prices are perhaps the most important consumer item that tariff opponents claimed would be pushed up by the metals tariffs. But these have hardly moved. Compared with a year ago, car prices are up just 0.1 percent. The price of new trucks is 0.1 percent higher than a year ago. Prices for both fell in September. Take the prices of soup and beer, Secretary Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s examples.\u00c2\u00a0 The price of soup jumped 1.6 percent in September, although there was no change in the relevant tariffs. For the year it is up 1.8 percent. The price of beer consumed at home fell 0.6 percent for the month and is up just 1.6 percent from a year ago. Of course, not all soup is canned. Beer is also sold in bottles. The government doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t track canned beer and canned soup separately. So it is possible that canned variations have seen more price inflation, offset by price declines in bottled beer and soup in cardboard containers. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largely irrelevant from the consumer perspective since shoppers can easily just switch to the cheaper category. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very little upward pricing pressure on beer consumed in bars and restaurants, which is notable because the price of beer kegs reportedly rose due to the aluminum tariffs. Beer consumed outside of the home is up just 0.3 percent compared with a year ago. Prices of canned fruits and vegetables, another category of consumer goods that was widely predicted to see prices rise because of increased aluminum costs, do not show signs of tariff-led inflation. The price of canned vegetables is up 3.3 percent from a year ago but the price of canned fruit is up just 0.3 percent. Canned veggies jumped a lot in September, for a 1.5 percent gain, likely because of sharp gains in the price of the vegetables themselves earlier in the year. In July, for example, the price of lettuce jumped 9.5 percent and tomatoes jumped 1.3 percent in August. The prices of both fell in September, which should bring the price of canned vegetables back down. Many of the categories of consumer goods that are largely manufactured abroad also saw steep declines, defying predictions that the China tariffs implemented last year would weigh on consumers. Tools and hardware were often cited by those promoting the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctariffs are taxes on consumers\u00e2\u0080\u009d narrative. But prices on these are up just 1.9 percent compared with a year ago. Outside of Breitbart News there has been very little reporting on the crash in the price of televisions. In September, television prices fell by another 0.7 percent. This is the fourteenth consecutive monthly decline for televisions, which means we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now compounding last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s declines with this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Compared with a year ago, television prices are off 19.4 percent. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty stunning because last September, prices were down 13.5 percent from the prior year. This steep decline may reflect foreign manufacturers competing with each other for market share by dumping televisions on the U.S. market. (There are no real domestic manufacturers for anti-dumping regulations to protect so it is unlikely the Commerce Department will take any action here. But that could be a policy error: if anyone were tempted to manufacture televisions in the U.S., they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d certainly be discouraged from doing so watching the price collapse so rapidly.) The price of computers, digital homes assistants, and phones were predicted to see upward pressure from tariffs on China. While these are not yet subject to direct tariffs yet, some of their components are. But computers and related hardware prices are down 3.3 percent compared with last year, dropping 0.9 percent in September alone. Phone prices fell again, for at least the thirteenth consecutive month and are now down 13.9 percent compared with a year ago. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now compounding annual price declines in phones so it is worth noting that in September of last year phone prices were down 6.5 percent compared with the year prior. (Note that mobile phones were excluded from the first two rounds of China tariffs but will be included in the round expected to be applied in December.) We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now over a year into the anti-dumping tariffs imposed in January of last year on washing machines. These were intended to drive up the price from artificially depressed levels and accomplished that goal last year. Those washing machine price gains, however, have faded. Laundry equipment prices fell 4.2 percent in August and fell another half a percentage point in September. They are now down 6.6 percent compared with a year ago, when prices were reflecting that initial boost. This shows the market adjusting to the initial tariff shock by expanding domestic production or lowering prices on foreign production. The tariffs on Chinese-made goods also do not seem to have had much of an effect on consumer prices. Appliance prices are up 1 percent compared with a year ago. The narrower \u00e2\u0080\u009cmajor appliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d category, which was pushed up by the sharp rise in washing machines, saw prices rise by 0.9 percent in September, halting the previous four consecutive monthly declines. Compared with a year ago, prices are now down 0.1 percent. The prices of furniture and bedding, one of the largest categories of China-made imports, and are up 2.3 percent annually. Toys, another big China import category, are down 6 percent compared with a year ago. Keep that in mind when you see the inevitable stories that claim tariffs are ruining holiday shopping. Sports equipment prices are down 2.2 percent. Clothing prices are down 0.3 percent compared with a year ago. Auto parts and equipment prices are up just 1.4 percent compared with a year ago.  British actress Julie Samuel on her 60 years old tricycle, 30th November 1970. (Photo by Reg Burkett/Daily Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Once again, the consumer price data has largely demolished the notion that tariffs are squeezing consumers. Phones, computers, and especially televisions have plummeted in price. Cars and trucks show no tariff pressure at all. Baseball mitts and other sports equipment are cheaper. Appliance prices are now below their year-ago levels. Toys are much cheaper. Major appliances have even fallen in price. Tariffs had driven the price of washing machines higher, as intended. But those prices have come down. Bicycle prices alone appear to be indicating any significant tariff pressure. That does not mean that prices will remain low or tariffs will never push prices up. But it demonstrates that even after over a year of tariffs, prices on consumers are not rising. The low prices may indicate that the burdens of tariffs are falling on foreign producers and on intermediate goods producers. This can happen when export prices fall in reaction to tariffs, either because manufacturers seek to maintain market share by discounting their goods or because foreign currencies decline against the dollar. The data is increasingly embarrassing for the Federal Reserve economists who claimed in two flawed studies that consumers were paying higher prices for goods subject to tariffs on steel, aluminum, or Chinese imports.",

In September, Warren added to her ultra-progressive agenda, promising to raise Social Security benefits by $200 per month.

Vanity Fair described the congressman, a former U.S. military veteran who served in Afghanistan, as a straight shooter who \u00e2\u0080\u009clacks all pretense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cRose is sick of politicians who jump on bandwagons such as the Green New Deal or Medicare for All, only to prevaricate when push comes to shove,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vanity Fair reported. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sign on to that [Green New Deal and Medicare for All] and then say that you are against parts of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rose told the magazine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTry to present that to folks that are here or anyone that we met today. You know? They will see right through you. That is why people hate the Democrats.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rose indicated to the magazine that both parties have failed to keep their promises to their constituents. However, the self-described \u00e2\u0080\u009cpopulist\u00e2\u0080\u009d added that voters \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust Democrats as far as they can throw them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead of trying to understand their constituents, Rose argues, too many Democrats end up patronizing them. They pander during elections, then abandon voters when they get to Washington,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vanity Fair pointed out. Last year, Rose became the second Democrat in decades to win the seat in New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pro-Trump 11th district. The New York Democrat now represents a district that President Trump won by ten percentage points in 2016. He won the election by painting him as an outsider. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have zero allegiance to the Democratic Party, zero,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the freshman lawmaker told Vanity Fair. On Monday, protesters flooded the New York Democrat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office over his newfound support of the impeachment inquiry, dismissed by the White House as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartisan and unconstitutional\u00e2\u0080\u009d investigation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be something that anyone wants to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rose told Vanity Fair, referring to his support of the investigation. Democrat leaders in the House are carrying out an impeachment inquiry devoid of the recognized standards governing similar efforts in the past, namely those involving Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has refused to hold a full House vote on authorizing an impeachment inquiry. During the Nixon and Clinton administrations, lawmakers did hold a vote. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters in Congress argue that such a vote is necessary to legitimize the investigation per the recognized standards of previous impeachment efforts. Not all of the 235 members of the House Democratic Caucus support the impeachment inquiry. Democrat lawmakers who represent Republican-leaning or Trump-friendly districts have come out against the investigation. According to a tally by the New York Times, ten Democrat House lawmakers oppose the impeachment inquiry. Internal polling\u00c2\u00a0suggests\u00c2\u00a0a storm is brewing for vulnerable Democrats in key congressional districts. Polling by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) shows most voters do not consider Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart an impeachable offense.",

      "subtitle": "A California judge is crippling the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immigration enforcement system, amid the myriad examples of murders and crimes committed by illegal migrants, ICE director Matt Albence said at a White House press conference.",
      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": " Immigration enforcement is \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeing singled out and marginalized in ways that no other federal law enforcement organization has to tolerate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTying our hands from the bench does not make our country any safer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will continue to put our lives on the line to protect the American public, despite the best efforts of those who like to see no enforcement or open borders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The judge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action was prompted by an ACLU lawsuit, which argued that some U.S. citizens were being misidentified as migrants by police databases. The judge announced September 27 he would end ICE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authority to detain individuals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including illegals who are arrested and held in state or county jails \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when arrests are based solely on evidence in databases. Once arrested, migrants are not deported until a judge orders their deportation. The California judge is Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Birotte Jr. He is the son of Haitian immigrants and was nominated by President Barack Obama. His ruling applies just to actions in Southern California, but that is where ICE has one of its major data centers, the\u00c2\u00a0Pacific Enforcement Response Center, in Laguna Niguel, California. Pro-migration groups rejoiced at their success: The PERC issues detainers 24-hours a day within California and after-hours to 41 other states. The ruling means that ICE may not issue any detainer request from the PERC to any state that does not expressly authorize local law enforcement to make immigration arrests in state law, and it may not issue a detainer without something more than database information to support a probable cause determination.  Albence described the problem: This decision issued by a single judge in Los Angeles will impact at least 43 states, threatening communities far beyond the one in which this judge [sits]. I wish I could say this is an isolated occurrence, it is but the latest example of judicial overreach targeting immigration enforcement and the application of laws already passed by Congress, often decades ago. The Department of Justice may ask the Supreme Court to suspend the judge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision. Albence slammed the progressives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 massive resistance to immigration laws: This decision will threaten public safety, as it will lead to the release of criminal aliens back onto the street \u00e2\u0080\u0093 criminals that we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find before they hurt. Or worse, more innocent victims that could have been spared their pain and suffering. If only ICE had been allowed to do its job \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Time and again, DHS has been prevented from exercising the authority granted to it by Congress, because of the decisions of unelected judges who substitute their judgment for that of our legislators, or the government officials and trusted with enforcing our laws. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA recent case, in a litany of tragic, tragic examples, clearly illustrates this danger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Albence said: Carlos Daniel Carillo-Lopez\u00c2\u00a0entered this country illegally as an unaccompanied alien child in 2015 [from Guatemala].\u00c2\u00a0He was arrested no less than four times in the past seven months in the state of Washington for charges including criminal trespass, theft, malicious mischief, and failure to appear. Each time ICE lodged a detainer [request to local jails]. Each time the detaining entities \u00e2\u0080\u0094 [which are] proud sanctuary jurisdictions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 release him without notifying ICE [in time for ICE to arrest the illegal].Tragically, on September 30th, 2019, he was arrested for homicide. His victim [was] another young man.  Albence said: ICE made approximately 140,000 arrests this year [and] about 75 percent of those arrests came from working with the jails and prisons. The other 25 percent are made by ICE at-large teams. It is critically important work. But it takes a lot more time and resources to make those arrests and a much greater risk to our officers, the public, and the subjects themselves. And we could have apprehended those criminal aliens from the safe confines of a jail upon their release. Pro-migration groups jeered at Albence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plea for enforcement of the law. NDLON, a group which represents illegal migrants, declared: The eerie retrograde\u00c2\u00a0racism on display from the White House podium this morning makes a case for \u00e2\u0080\u0093 rather than against \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sanctuary cities\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00c2\u00a0 The Trump Administration is a threat to local public safety.\u00c2\u00a0 This is a fact.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0And no amount of Mexican-bashing, Central American-bashing, or Muslim-bashing will change the truth that recently arrived immigrants \u00e2\u0080\u0093 documented and undocumented \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are now taking the historical baton and defending bedrock constitutional values for everyone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe oath of office taken by the men and women of ICE means something to us, which is why we will adapt like we always do, why we will persevere like we always do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Albence said. He added: We will continue to put our lives on the line to protect the American public despite the best efforts of those who like to see no enforcement or open borders. But make no mistake, rulings from any individual federal court, sitting in a single judicial district purporting to cripple ice authorities on a nationwide basis puts people at risk, innocent victims whose lives will be forever changed for the worse, all across our great country. And we could have stopped it. ",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " McBath, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, voted in favor of the impeachment inquiry last month. Protesters gathered outside of her office on Wednesday to demonstrate support for the president, chanting \u00e2\u0080\u009cfour more years\u00e2\u0080\u009d and holding up Trump 2020 signs. One sign spotted at the protest read, \u00e2\u0080\u009cImpeach Pelosi.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had an agenda from day one to bring [Trump] down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resident Jill Wright said of McBath,\u00c2\u00a0according to AJC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Democrats need to work for their constituents and not have an agenda,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are disrespecting our president and they are also setting a poor example for our children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d McBath is in a vulnerable district, barely edging out former Rep. Karen Handel (R-GA) in 2018. McBath won by one percent, or\u00c2\u00a03,264 votes. Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sixth Congressional District\u00c2\u00a0tilted in Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favor in the 2016 election by 1.5 percent, although Trump ultimately won the state. However, as internal polling suggests, Democrats in key congressional districts face an uphill battle, as the majority of constituents do not consider Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky an impeachable offense, and that conversation largely serves as the basis for the partisan-fueled impeachment inquiry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPro-Trump patriots showed up to @RepLucyMcBath\u00e2\u0080\u0098s office in #GA06 this week to protest her support of Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment witch-hunt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Donald Trump Jr. wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry #LiberalLucy, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vote for Pelosi for Speaker, support her impeachment witch-hunt and still call yourself a \u00e2\u0080\u0098moderate,'\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009c#VoteHerOut\u00e2\u0080\u009d:  McBath responded to the protests on Twitter, accusing the president and his eldest son of \u00e2\u0080\u009cattacking\u00e2\u0080\u009d her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Trump and his son are attacking me because I voted for the impeachment inquiry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYesterday, they bussed folks to my office in #GA06 to protest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI refuse to be intimidated, I will do what is right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, asking for donations:  McBath is hardly the first Democrat lawmaker to face opposition over her support of an impeachment inquiry.

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " \u00e2\u0080\u009cRecently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stark message to the Ukrainian President,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter reads from the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees.  The lawmakers requested that Perry turn over the documents by October 18th. The development comes after\u00c2\u00a0Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spokesperson confirmed the Energy Secretary encouraged President Trump to discuss energy and economic issues with the leader of Ukraine during their July 25th telephone call, which was mischaracterized by a partisan CIA officer in a so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d complaint. The officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint has since sparked House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSecretary Perry absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shaylyn Hynes, a Perry spokesperson, said in a statement. President Trump on Friday evening told House Republicans that it was Perry who had teed up the July call with Ukraine, according to a person familiar with Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new comments who was granted anonymity to discuss the private conference call. But President Trump did not suggest that Perry had anything to do with the pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, or a U.S. holdup in military aid to the country, the person said. The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks on the late Friday call was first reported by Axios. Perry, the former governor of Texas and up to now a lower-profile but active member of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cabinet, has made repeated trips to Ukraine and met often with Ukranian officials, including Zelenskiy. Perry and his agency say his involvement with Ukraine was part of U.S. policy, predating the Trump administration, to increase U.S. natural gas, coal and other supplies to Eastern Europe to lessen Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control of the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy market. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe continues to believe that there is significant need for improved regional energy security,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hynes said. Perry was heading to Lithuania again Sunday night, and would meet with nearly two dozen European energy officials, including those from Ukraine, she said. Both President Trump and Zelensky have denied any pressure was applied to probe Biden, whose alleged corruption in Ukraine and China has garnered negative attention for the former vice president amid sinking 2020 poll numbers and a rising candidacy of rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was no blackmail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zelensky\u00c2\u00a0told\u00c2\u00a0reporters when asked Thursday about his call with President Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not servants. We are an independent country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be pulled into this because I understand that my words could impact the elections of the American people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.

One ex-military parent said it was offensive to see a political agenda being set in the classroom after he served 20 years in the military saving lives. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat type of behavior offends me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Randy London, a U.S Coast Guard veteran who spoke during the school board meeting, according to the Vineland Daily Journal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying anyone needs to agree with everything, but if that is the district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy, there should be no teacher \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 taking a knee during the Pledge of Allegiance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ron Maccri, a Vineland resident, also complained that she was using tax dollars to take the role of a parent, calling her kneeling during the pledge \u00e2\u0080\u009creprehensible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maccri added that the school was named after\u00c2\u00a0Sgt. Dominick Pilla, a U.S. Army ranger killed in Somalia on October 3, 1993. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTeachers are paid to educate our students, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not paid to indoctrinate our students, he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat this woman is doing would be bad in any school, but because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the (Sgt.) Dominick Pilla School \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who gave his life for our military\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reprehensible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The principal decided after the school board meeting to reassign the teacher to administrative duties during the morning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homeroom period to avoid further conflict, the Philly Voice reported.",

      "content": " \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a full-on major effort state campaign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh told the New York Times in a story published early Thursday morning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we will have the resources behind it to make it count,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Murtaugh added. President Trump narrowly lost the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ten electoral college votes by about 44,000 votes in 2016, the best Republican showing in Minnesota since President Richard Nixon won the state in the 1972 presidential election. The Times reported\u00c2\u00a0in its Thursday story: Brad Parscale, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, is planning to pour tens of millions of dollars into the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Minnesota operation, compared with the $30,000 the Trump campaign spent on the state last cycle.\u00c2\u00a0The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100. And the campaign and the Republican National Committee are outspending Democrats by about four to one on digital advertising, according to campaign officials and local Democratic Party officials. Democrats are taking note of the Republican efforts and have voiced concerns that Minnesota may actually be in play in 2020. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOver the last 25 years, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen an investment as robust and deep this early by a Republican presidential candidate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party\u00c2\u00a0told the Times. On Monday, Martin and the DFL attempted to raise money off Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit to Minnesota in a tweet that said: THREAD: Trump is coming to Minnesota this week to break our blue wall and flip our state red in 2020. That can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re launching a #MoneyBlizzard to make sure we have the resources to fight back against his hateful campaign. RT & Donate: https://t.co/as41eNTLc0\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Minnesota DFL Party (@MinnesotaDFL) October 7, 2019 An earlier effort by the Democrat Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to force the Trump campaign to pay $530,000 in order to hold Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally at the Target Center failed on Tuesday, as Breitbart News reported: The Trump campaign claimed victory late Tuesday in its battle with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a first term Democrat elected in 2017 who wanted the campaign to pay more than $500,000 in security expenses for Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally at the Target Center. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe arena in Minneapolis has been fully approved. The Target Center has backed off cancelling the contract, which means President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Keep America Great rally will go on as scheduled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cConsistent with our original agreement with the venue, the Trump campaign has not agreed to pay any additional funds. We look forward to seeing everyone Thursday night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parscale concluded. The presidential election is not the only area where Minnesota is expected to be a battleground in 2020. Five of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eight congressional districts are \u00e2\u0080\u009cswing seats\u00e2\u0080\u009d that could be switched from one party to another. Three of those seats are currently held by Democrats, two by Republicans. Should Republicans pick up all three seats, they would only need to flip 16 more in other states around the country to take back the majority in the House of Representatives. Both supporters and opponents of President Trump are expected to show up in force outside the Target Center prior to Thursday evening\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally.",

      "content": " Williams will receive the medal for his actions in Afghanistan on April 6, 2008, as a weapons sergeant with Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha 3336, Special Operations Task Force-33, assault element. His actions helped save the lives of four critically wounded soldiers and prevented the lead element of the assault force from being overrun by the enemy, according to a White House statement. Facing rocket-propelled grenade, sniper, and machine gun fire, then-Sgt. Williams led an Afghan Commando element across a fast-moving, ice cold, and waist-deep river to fight its way up a terraced mountain to the besieged lead element of the assault force. He then\u00c2\u00a0set up a base of fire that the enemy was not able to overcome. When his team sergeant was wounded by sniper fire, Williams exposed himself to enemy fire to come to his aid and to move him down the mountainside to the casualty collection point, and then braved small arms fire and climbed back up the cliff to evacuate other injured soldiers and repair the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s satellite radio. He again exposed himself to enemy fire as he helped move several casualties down the near vertical mountainside and as he carried and loaded casualties on to evacuation helicopters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSergeant Williams\u00e2\u0080\u0099 actions are in keeping with the finest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself. Combined Joint Special Operations Task-Force-Afghanistan, Operation Command Central, and the United States Army,\u00e2\u0080\u009d USASOC spokesman Lt. Col. Loren Bymer said in a statement. Williams is a native of\u00c2\u00a0Boerne, Texas, and graduated from Angelo State University with a Bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Degree in Criminal Justice. He enlisted into the Army under the 18X Special Forces enlistment program in September 2005 and became a Green Beret in 2007, serving with Charlie Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne). In 2008, he deployed to Afghanistan with Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha 3336, Special Operations Task Force-33. Williams has deployed\u00c2\u00a0multiple times in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Juniper Shield, serving in numerous positions, including weapons sergeant, Charlie Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd SFG (A); senior weapons sergeant, Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd SFG (A); senior instructor/writer, Delta Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Special Warfare Training Group; senior weapons sergeant, Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion 3rd SFG (A); and operations sergeant, Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion 3rd SFG (A). He is still serving in the United States Army and is assigned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. When off duty, he enjoys hunting and spending time with his wife, Kate, and their son, Nolan, the White House statement said. His awards and decorations include the Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal with two Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters, Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal with two Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters, Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal with Bronze Clasp and four Loops, National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with three Bronze Service Stars, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon with Numeral \u00e2\u0080\u009c4,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon with Numeral \u00e2\u0080\u009c3,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Valorous Unit Award, Combat Infantryman Badge, Parachutist Badge, and Special Forces Tab.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The group \u00e2\u0080\u0094 under the leadership of the chair, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, and chair-elect, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti \u00e2\u0080\u0094 announced its support for the Green New Deal on a worldwide scale, arguing that it is necessary to\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cdrive an urgent, fundamental and irreversible transfer of global resources away from fossil fuels and into action that averts the climate emergency.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The group boasted of \u00e2\u0080\u009c94 climate leader cities\u00e2\u0080\u009d recognizing the \u00e2\u0080\u009cglobal climate emergency.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Per the release: The message was issued by city leaders attending the C40 World Mayors Summit in Copenhagen. Their call came in response to intergovernmental action being blocked by a minority of very powerful, science-denying governments, representing the interests of the fossil-fuel industry. Through the Global Green New Deal, cities have reaffirmed their commitment to protecting our environment, strengthening our economy, and building a more equitable future by cutting emissions from the sectors most responsible for the climate crisis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 transportation, buildings, industry, and waste \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to keep global heating below the 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement. The city leaders called to cut global emissions by 50 percent by 2030, an effort the United States has already led the charge on despite a lack of participation in the Paris Agreement. Carbon emissions from energy usage from the U.S. are at the lowest levels since 1992, as Breitbart News\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entertainment editor and author of 50 Things They Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Want You to Know, Jermone Hudson, told Fox & Friends last month. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report last year, which indicated that greenhouse gas emissions decreased during Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first year in office. As Breitbart News reported: The EPA report revealed that total greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 2.7 percent from 2016 to 2017. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks to President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regulatory reform agenda, the economy is booming, energy production is surging, and we are reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major industrial sources,\u00e2\u0080\u009d EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese achievements flow largely from technological breakthroughs in the private sector, not the heavy hand of government. The Trump Administration has proven that federal regulations are not necessary to drive CO2 reductions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wheeler continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile many around the world are talking about reducing greenhouse gases, the U.S. continues to deliver, and today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report is further evidence of our action-oriented approach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs mayors our first priority is to protect the safety of our citizens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hidago said.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will soon be four years since the Paris Agreement was signed in our city.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorld leaders met in New York just last month and once again failed to agree anything close to the level of action necessary to stop the climate crisis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, decrying their \u00e2\u0080\u009cineptitude\u00e2\u0080\u009d and proclaiming that it \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirectly threatens all people around the globe as time keeps running against us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no other solution but a Global Green New Deal to be the pivotal instrument to win this race against the clock. All decision-makers must take responsibility in making it a reality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen it comes to climate action, no one is doing more than cities, but no one is doing enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Garcetti concurred. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are entering a make-or-break decade for the preservation of our planet and environmental justice for every community \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I am proud to lead C40 cities at this critical moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTogether we will continue leading the drive to protect the world and promote a better, more equitable life for everyone living in it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Freshman \u00e2\u0080\u009cSquad\u00e2\u0080\u009d member Rep.

      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " Schweizer elaborated on his Wednesday-published New York Times opinion editorial in a same-day interview on SiriusXM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host and Washington Post columnist Henry Olsen. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (R-KY) financial relationship with the Chinese state is illustrative of the status quo of foreign business relationships between politicians and foreign governments evading disclosure requirements, explained Schweizer. The family of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who is McConnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, owns a seafaring shipping business, noted Schweizer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey had it even before Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao were married, but in 1993 \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the Chinese government basically struck a deal with the Chao family, where they said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We will finance the construction of your cargo ships. We will provide crews for your cargo ships, and state-owned enterprises in China will give you lots of contracts to ship our goods around Asia.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schweizer continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen as that relationship has budded, is basically that Mitch McConnell has become a lot less critical of the Chinese government, and this is essentially what the Chinese are playing at. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done it in Australia. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done it in New Zealand [and] other parts of Asia. They are quite confident that the way to deal with adversarial countries or countries that are resistant to their policies is essentially [is to] try to buy off the political class, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had some success in doing that, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing that in the United States today.\u00e2\u0080\u009d LISTEN:  Schweizer noted how Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s geopolitical analysis of China changed following his youngest son, Hunter Biden, launching a private equity firm with $1.5 billion in financing from the Chinese state. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJoe Biden was basically a hawk on China for most of his Senate career in the \u00e2\u0080\u009980s and \u00e2\u0080\u009990s, even up until the early parts of the Obama administration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schweizer remarked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJoe Biden has basically said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We should welcome a rising China. China is not a threat. There is benefit to China becoming stronger, because they will be more like us.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is going to eat our lunch? C\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Biden in May, further dismissing China as a geopolitical threat, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not a competition for us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Olsen contrasted news media focus on alleged foreign-rooted conflicts of interest between President Donald Trump and those of Joe Biden via Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business dealings in China and Ukraine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe thing that gets me is that Hunter Biden is obviously a troubled individual,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Olsen stated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe New Yorker magazine profile of him goes into enormous detail about his troubles. For three years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been hearing about every little thing about the Trump children or the Trump administration, and how awful it is that foreign dignitaries stay at the Trump Hotel in DC because they might be currying favor with the president, and how terrible it is that Chinese investors are buying condos in Jared Kushner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buildings, and yet here we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got this troubled person, who Joe Biden obviously loves, who is raking in cash well beyond his expertise, and supposedly we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not supposed to be worried about it. The double standard here is just glaring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Olsen added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost like you can imagine some sort of shakedown deal. You can almost imagine somebody going up to [Joe Biden] and saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Nice son you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got there. Shame if something were to happen to him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very troubling. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have to say that [Joe Biden] has changed his mind [on China.] The fact is Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future is now indebted to people and regimes that are potentially hostile to the United States, and definitely regimes that we want to have an interest in, and he, unfortunately, has a personal stake [in this] because of his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s news, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as much news as when the president of Ukraine says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, I stayed in the Trump Tower when I was in New York.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 In fact, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked by Mansour for solutions to combating foreign procurement of political influence through business relationships with politicians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 family members, Schweizer proposed legislation modeled after the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the paradox,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Schweizer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA few years ago \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 one of [J.P. Morgan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s] subsidiaries was fined hundreds of millions of dollars by the federal government of the United States because what their subsidiary did was hire the children of Communist Party officials in China with the explicit hope of getting favorable treatment from the Chinese government. So they paid a large fine for that, and that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which means you are not allowed to provide a favor or a benefit to a foreign government officials in exchange for favorable treatment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schweizer continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for a reason. It does not apply in the United States. If J.P. Morgan did what they did in China and got fined for \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if they did the same thing in the United States \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it would be completely legal and acceptable. And to me, that should be unacceptable.\u00c2\u00a0The notion that American corporations are not allowed to buy foreign politicians \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but foreign corporations can buy American politicians \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think is where we want to be as a country. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proposing [a] legislative solution that creates similar barriers to hiring the family members of politicians in the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Without identifying specific persons, Schweizer revealed that he had discussed the aforementioned legislative proposal with some senators. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI recognize it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be easy to get passed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Schweizer of the Washington Corrupt Practices Act. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve people on both sides of the aisle that want to cash in, but I think this is key, or we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to continue to see in this country a descent into more corruption, into kind of a third-world swamp where the political class is getting rich and their interests are not aligned with the populace; their interests are aligned with foreign oligarchs or companies that are paying them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt a very minimum \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there ought to be a disclosure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schweizer continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Joe Biden or Mitch McConnell are running for office, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re required to disclose a $200 donation from anybody. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s required by federal law, and the reason is we want to know who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s putting money in their campaign coffers if that person is getting favorable treatment or influence. And they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also required to disclose if they have $1000 in stock in General Electric, because we want to make sure their decisions are not being marred by their own financial interests. So they have to disclose those things.\u00c2\u00a0But their adult child, like Hunter Biden, joins a Chinese firm \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a billion-dollar firm funded by the Chinese government \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no disclosure requirement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Existing disclosure requirements related to campaign contributions and investment are insufficient to reveal potential conflicts of interest between politicians and foreign states, noted Schweizer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would argue that if you are a foreign entity, the best way to get influence over an American politician is not by making a $200 campaign contribution, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not by hoping they own $1000 of your stock, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by striking a lucrative deal with one of their kids, and yet there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no disclosure requirement.\u00c2\u00a0At a minimum, we should require American politicians [and] elected officials in senior government positions [to disclose] if their immediate family members have deals with foreign governments. They should be required to disclose that and let citizens know that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Washington Corrupt Practices Act may yield bipartisan support, speculated Schweizer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis has the prospect of a kind of populist left-right legislative approach,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schweizer estimated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cImagine if you could have a Ted Cruz, [a] conservative Republican, and an [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], who is really a left-wing socialist in Congress, both of them [support this]. This is the sort of issue I think resonates with them and their view of Washington. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re suspicious of the establishment. They see this as corrupt and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping that we can find common cause.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schweizer added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what happened with the STOCK Act. You had conservative Republicans in the Freedom Caucus [and] left-wing Democrats in New York who all said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outrageous. They shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be trading stock in this way. We need to place some restrictions on it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I think this has the same marker. The biggest challenge you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have is with leadership. Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been there for a long time. They like to set aside these kinds of perks for themselves. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to place restrictions on fellow members of Congress. I think you have reform-minded people in both parties, and I just think they need to have the courage to step up and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You know what? We need to have a legislative solution to this,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be very hard for the leadership to resist a move, because these are not issues where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to find even five percent of the American people who think this is a good idea. Most Democrats and most Republicans think this is terrible and needs to stop.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Olsen concluded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSounds to me like the one thing Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and President Trump could all agree on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Breitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Kate Bedingfield, the former vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputy campaign manger, sent a letter to the Times on Wednesday, lambasting the paper for publishing an op-ed by Peter Schweizer, a senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailing several such instances. In particular, Schweizer, who helms the Government Accountability Institute, noted that the former vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s youngest son, Hunter, profited off deals with Ukraine and China that were inaccessible to the average American businessman. Instead of refuting Schweizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument, Bedingfield\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter attacked the Times\u00c2\u00a0for having published the opinion piece in the first place. The deputy campaign manger even went to the extent of accusing the paper of not having \u00e2\u0080\u009cinternalized the sobering lessons of 2016\u00e2\u0080\u009d by giving \u00e2\u0080\u009ctop billing\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cright-wing polemicist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision is hardly the first example,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bedingfield wrote, before proceeding to claim the\u00c2\u00a0Times\u00c2\u00a0had an \u00e2\u0080\u009coutsized hand in the spread of a baseless conspiracy theory\u00e2\u0080\u009d concerning the Biden family.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was especially troubling about the Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s active participation in this smear campaign is that prior to its reporting\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this conspiracy had been relegated to the likes of\u00c2\u00a0Breitbart,\u00c2\u00a0Russian propaganda, and another conspiracy theorist, regular\u00c2\u00a0Hannity\u00c2\u00a0guest\u00c2\u00a0John Solomon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s line of attack, although unsurprising given their frequent broadsides against the media, comes as Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings have spilled into the open amid the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. At the center of the inquiry is a conversation the president had with the Ukrainian government suggesting they probe how the younger Biden secured an appointment to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden was appointed to the oil and gas giant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s board, a position which paid as much as\u00c2\u00a0$83,000 per month, in 2014, around the same time his father was made the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point man on Ukraine. Breitbart News has followed that story, along with Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ties to a private equity firm bankrolled by the Chinese government, since Schweizer published his bestselling book \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.",

      "content": " On Wednesday, CNN revealed the Biden campaign \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid not rule out\u00e2\u0080\u009d reaching out to Google and YouTube as well. The Biden campaign sent letters to Facebook and Twitter, demanding that they ban an ad by U.S. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election campaign. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election campaign ad accuses the former vice president and his son, Hunter Biden, of corrupt activities in Ukraine. Unlike CNN, the Times, Facebook, and Twitter have resited Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to silence Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assertion that Biden engaged in improper dealings with Ukraine while serving as vice president. On Wednesday, Biden campaign staffers sent also sent a letter to the NYT\u00c2\u00a0complaining about its coverage of the former vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alleged pattern of corruption in Ukraine, including the newspaper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s publication of an editorial by author and Breitbart senior contributor\u00c2\u00a0Peter Schweizer. A spokesperson for NYT maintained that its coverage has been \u00e2\u0080\u009cfair and accurate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The newspaper will \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy to sit down with Biden advisers anytime to discuss news coverage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the spokesperson declared. The refusal\u00c2\u00a0by NYT, Twitter, and Facebook to put the lid on information about Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s link to corruption in Ukraine has angered the Biden campaign, prompting it to lash out. Facebook rejected a request from Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2020 campaign to remove a video ad by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election campaign that highlights allegations of corruption against Biden and his son, Hunter. In a statement, the social media platform said its decision is \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrounded in Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and belief that in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Irked by Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response, Biden campaign spokesperson TJ Ducklo called the reply \u00e2\u0080\u009cunacceptable\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said that the dissemination of \u00e2\u0080\u009cobjectively false information to influence public opinion poisons the public discourse and chips away at our democracy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ducklo did not explicitly comment on the substance of the ad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accusations. The video asserts that Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid to Ukraine unless the eastern European country fired a prosecutor reportedly investigating an energy company. Hunter Biden served on the Ukrainian company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s board at the time. Biden bragged on video about bullying Ukraine into firing the prosecutor. Titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cBiden Corruption,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the 30-second video clip is running on various cable networks and online.  On Wednesday, CNN obtained a letter from the Biden presidential campaign asking Twitter to reject what appears to be the same Trump re-election campaign ad. The letter \u00e2\u0080\u009cacknowledges that the social media company has said the ad complies with its policies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the news network noted. Nevertheless, the Biden campaign reportedly requested that Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u009cpromptly reassess\u00e2\u0080\u009d that position. CNN reported: Specifically, the letter calls on Twitter to make a distinction between the personal account of a politician and paid advertising content \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Twitter has not responded to CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for comment. The move from Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team appears to be part of a broad campaign to respond to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attacks on social media. Last Monday, CNN refused to run the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBiden Corruption\u00e2\u0080\u009d ad,\u00c2\u00a0alleging\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0the video \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes not meet our advertising standards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the network added in a statement. Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communications director, lambasted CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision, accusing the network of \u00e2\u0080\u009cspend[ing] all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, claiming he attempted to coerce his Ukrainian counterpart into investigating the corruption allegations against Biden and his son. Trump and Ukrainian President\u00c2\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky have denied the claim. The White House is refusing to cooperate with the impeachment investigation, saying it is a\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cpartisan and unconstitutional\u00e2\u0080\u009d probe.",

The last round of high-level talks in Shanghai was broken off early when Chinese and American officials quickly realized that neither side was willing to move far from the positions that had stalled talks back in the spring. President Trump responded by announcing a new round of tariff hikes and China promised retaliation. On Thursday morning, it seemed talks might again be on the verge of a breakdown before they had even begun. The South China Morning Post reported deputy-level trade talks this week had made no progress and that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He would leave after the first day of what were scheduled to be two days of talks. President Donald Trump, however, appears to have rescued the talks by announcing that he would host Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House on Friday.  This afternoon lunch was delivered to the negotiators and the talks extended into the early evening.  There have been a number of reports in the media suggesting that the Trump administration may be open to a partial deal, perhaps around the idea of a currency pact. That could involve China agreeing to not allow its currency to fall below a specified range in exchange for the U.S. lifting the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccurrency manipulator\u00e2\u0080\u009d label and possibly easing back on existing tariffs or not implementing hikes scheduled for later this year.

      "subtitle": "Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) has sent a letter to National Public Radio (NPR) asking for a retraction and correction for its \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisingenuous\u00e2\u0080\u009d article claiming that the lawmaker had provided false information in an interview with the taxpayer-funded media outlet about the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to impeach President Donald Trump.",
      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": " In an October 2 interview with All Things Considered host Michel Martin, Banks called out Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, for leading what Banks described as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical impeachment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the end of the interview article NPR posted on its website, Martin added commentary criticizing Banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 remarks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe feel we must note that Congressman Banks did not accurately describe The New York Times reporting about Congressman Schiff and the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Martin said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Times quoted a spokesman for Congressman Schiff who said Schiff never saw any part of the complaint or knew precisely what the whistleblower would deliver.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as Breitbart News reported, the Washington Post called out Schiff for his dishonesty: The Washington Post\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cFact Checker\u00e2\u0080\u009d column hit House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) with four Pinocchios\u00c2\u00a0Friday for falsely claiming that his panel had \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot spoken directly\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the partisan CIA officer behind a so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d complaint about President Donald Trump. Then NPR sent out its public editor, Elizabeth Jensen, to not only accuse Banks of inaccurate remarks, but promote the idea that the news outlet should use only pre-taped interviews instead of live ones so that it could edit them before they were aired. Banks addressed his letter seeking a retraction and correction to Edith Chapin, vice president and executive editor of NPR, and cc\u00e2\u0080\u0099d all Republicans in the House and the Senate: In fact, it is Mrs. Jensen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s article that spreads misinformation. The premise of the article, that I mischaracterized Adam Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with the whistleblower, is false. I request that NPR publish an article correcting her \u00e2\u0080\u009ccorrection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After a rambling introduction that takes well over half of the article and repeatedly alludes to \u00e2\u0080\u009cerrors\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmisinformation\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the October 2 interview, Mrs. Jensen finally presents her account of my supposed lie. Apparently, I am guilty of \u00e2\u0080\u009cincorrectly asserting that Schiff had \u00e2\u0080\u009clied\u00e2\u0080\u009d about his role in the whistleblower complaint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Jensen then adds \u00e2\u0080\u009c(I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to repeat the entire incorrect statement.)\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as if my claims were so vulgar and salacious as to be unworthy of reprint. If she had included my full remarks, well-informed readers would see that everything I said about Adam Schiff is true. And demonstrably so. I stated the following three facts, which are taken directly from the interview transcript, and which Mrs. Jensen claims are false: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdam Schiff knew about the whistleblower. The whistleblower came to Chairman Schiff and to the intelligence committee even though he lied about it and said that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never spoken directly to the whistleblower. We now know that he was part of orchestrating the whistleblower account to begin with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Banks points out in the letter that on the same day of the NPR interview, the New York Times ran a story \u00e2\u0080\u009cdetailing how the whistleblower spoke with a House Intelligence Committee aide about the Trump-Zelensky phone call before the whistleblower filed an official complaint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also said Schiff made the same false claim in an interview on MSNBC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring a September 17, interview on \u00e2\u0080\u0098Morning Joe\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Adam Schiff stated, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We have not directly spoken with the whistleblower.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 This, as the New York Times report proved, is untrue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Banks wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, Chairman Schiff, like Mrs. Jensen, did, in fact, \u00e2\u0080\u0098lie about it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Banks wrote. Banks then nailed down the final true statement he made in the interview: Regarding my final claim, the New York Times story reports that Chairman Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aide counseled the whistleblower to find legal representation and then file a formal complaint with an inspector general. In accordance with the staffer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice, the whistle-blower hired attorneys Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid, and submitted a complaint to Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Additionally, on September 10, 2019 Chairman Schiff sent a public letter to acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, calling for him to turn over a then little-known whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee. According to the New York Times report, Maguire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staff was \u00e2\u0080\u009cpuzzled\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the aggressive, public campaign, as such negotiations are typically conducted privately.\u00c2\u00a0 The Chairman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unusual decision was clearly motivated by his firsthand knowledge of the whistleblowers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 grievance. So, Chairman Schiff did play a clear role in \u00e2\u0080\u009corchestrating the whistleblower account.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Banks also called out NPR for claiming it interviews more Democrats than Republicans because members of the GOP won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree to be interviewed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut she never asks why they might hesitate to appear on NPR. The lack of self-awareness is astounding,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Banks wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRepublicans have come to expect the biased, deceptive, and self-serving behavior embodied by Mrs. Jensen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s article. Its publication simply served to remind conservatives that NPR will not treat us fairly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithin NPR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newsroom, it seems Mrs. Jensen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stance towards my interview is a typical one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Banks wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen a listener tweeted \u00e2\u0080\u0098Jim Banks spouting clear lies on NPR and he got no pushback. Why?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098All things Considered\u00e2\u0080\u0099 host Mary Louise Kelly replied, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever interviewed Jim Banks but when I do, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look forward to pressing him for evidence.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will not be interviewing me anytime soon, but luckily Mrs. Kelly can find the \u00e2\u0080\u0098evidence\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she seeks by reading this letter, or the original New York Times report,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. Banks concludes his letter by reminding NPR that as a taxpayer-funded media outlet it has \u00e2\u0080\u009ca special responsibility to remain evenhanded\u00e2\u0080\u009d even while acknowledging that all of public broadcasting has a long history of political bias to the left. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, if you retract and issue a correction to Mrs. Jensen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disingenuous article, NPR will have taken a step towards basic standards of journalistic integrity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Banks wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if you sincerely do wish to book Republican lawmakers, they may be more likely to accept your request.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " During a press conference at the White House, Tarrant County, Texas Sheriff Bill Waybourn said local jurisdictions must not be forced to release criminal illegal aliens from custody by federal judges. Waybourn said: If these people want to change things, Capital Hill is down the street, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re changed at. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not the policymakers. And people often get confused with that. But grilling down just a little bit in Tarrant County, Texas, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the 15th largest county in the nation, is this morning we had 4,200 inmates out of that 7 percent were illegal aliens. And they were being held for such offenses as murder, sexual assault of children \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there was about 70 of them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and so, and there were robbers in there and kidnappers and people who committed arson and people who were DWI. [Emphasis added] And out of that, you know, you think about that if we returned them with this radical ruling out of California where you have a federal judge making law for the nation, or attempting to, it will put our communities in jeopardy. Of those people that we have in custody, we know for a fact that 72 percent of them are repeat offenders. So if we have to turn them loose or they get released they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming back to your neighborhood in my neighborhood. These drunks will run over your children, and they will run over my children. And if that happens, I know that you will want, and certainly, I would want for you, the full force of the law and immigration is part of that full force. These people have come into the country illegally. [Emphasis added] Waybourn said illegal alien children are often the victims of illegal alien sex offenders in Tarrant County, noting that his sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office works with the victims to prosecute the perpetrator. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the people that we have in jail, are here illegally in the first place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Waybourn said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen they commit an offense against one of our citizens. And often, some people from their own community. For instance, aggravated sexual assault on children are not children who are legally here, they are their children that are here illegally. Unfortunately, those people are crying out, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking care of them and treating them as victims.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Every year, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrest tens of thousands of illegal aliens who have been convicted of drunk driving, often killing Americans in the process, and illegal alien sex offenders. In 2018, alone, ICE agents arrested\u00c2\u00a054,630 illegal aliens convicted of drunk driving. Another nearly 5,000 illegal alien sex offenders were arrested, along with 1,641 illegal aliens who had been convicted of murder.

      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " Saved in America is a volunteer organization composed of retired military personnel and law enforcement who help authorities find and rescue missing children. Unsecured regions of the southern border have become major child sex-trafficking routes, Travers explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe second-largest child sex-trafficking corridor sector is San Diego County because the largest trafficking sector is San Diego County. Texas is number one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re with me that a secure border is actually a humanitarian thing because it does keep kids safer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marlow asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbsolutely. One hundred percent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Travers responded. LISTEN:  Human trafficking \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including child sex-trafficking \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is a criminal enterprise dominated by transnational drug cartels, Travers said. He recalled his organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in assisting the recovery of a 14-year-old American girl in Mexico who had been abducted by a Mexican gang member and smuggled across the southern border. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA 29-year-old gang member affiliated with the Mexican mafia got ahold of [the 14-year-old American girl] and her social networking through one of her friends and saw that the young girl was posting [about] her problems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Travers said. \u00e2\u0080\u009c[He] befriended her, unbeknownst to [her] mom, and this person lured her.\u00c2\u00a0 [He] told her, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You need to come with me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take care of you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and [made] all these promises \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and [spoke of] how much affection he had for her.\u00c2\u00a0So one day the mom went to go take the 14-year-old to school, the window was open, and she was gone. He had plied her up with drugs and taken her down to Mexico, and we had to find her in Mexico and coordinate her rescue, and now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in jail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Travers linked his professional background as a Los Angeles police officer to his decision to found Saved in America. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy background is obviously police investigation and private investigation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Travers said.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe motivation for us to do this is, as the founder, I was listening to [the story of a] young girl named Brittanee Drexel from upstate New York that went missing, and I was wondering, \u00e2\u0080\u0098What happened?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and I knew from working narcotics in Los Angeles that there formed what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call an evil triad of street gang members, prison gang members, and the cartel that took over the narcotics-trafficking trade in this country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Around 2009, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis same triad decided to take over child sex-trafficking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Travers explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRight after that, I read an article about United States Navy SEALs overseas rescuing children. So I got a hold of these guys and I said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hey, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you come out here and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put cops together with special operators, and for free, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go help find these children?'\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe way kids are taken in this country, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like the movie Taken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Traver said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese gang members and gang member recruiters lure young girls through social media networking away from their homes and ply them up with drugs, up to and including heroin. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how they traffic our children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coercion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coerced.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He cited a study conducted in San Diego County which showed that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at least one gang member recruiter or trafficker in every middle school and high school\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the county. Child predators often use social media to target vulnerable young girls from troubled backgrounds, Travers explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey look for a young girl who might be going through some type of trauma, like [parental] divorce, a death in the family, a break-up with a friend or something. Then \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 they befriend the child [via] social networking and social networking applications to have conversations with the child that the parent has no idea [are occurring], and then one day the parent goes to get the child to take them to school, and the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re missing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Forensic analysis of missing children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internet behavior is critical in determining the nature of their disappearances, Travers said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt appears to the normal police officer is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a runaway, but in fact, the answer lies in the social networking of the child, that she was seduced outside of the family and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how they traffic them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Travers highlighted the volume of missing children \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including those being trafficked \u00e2\u0080\u0094 across America. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a problem across the country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d determined Travers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccording to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, there [are] about 300,000 missing children in our country at any one time. Now, if you take another statistic that 30 to 40 percent of these 300,000 children are being trafficked \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking 100,000 children in our country [who] are being sex-trafficked, who are being enslaved by organized crime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Saved in America accepts donations.

We all believe in freedom of religion. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all proud Americans, everybody has the right to practice their own religion. But we cannot now use the argument that it is my religious belief that if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gay, I will not sell you a cake, or I will \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if you are black, it is my religious belief you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come into my store, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Jewish, or whatever. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone way, way beyond that. And it worries me very much that there is a strong movement trying to bring \u00e2\u0080\u0094 under the guise of freedom of religion, racism, and sexism, and homophobia back into this \u00e2\u0080\u0093.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He later added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would pass federal legislation that makes it clear, absolutely clear that it is illegal to prohibit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to have discrimination against anybody because of their sexual orientation. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear, and it would be very broad and sweeping legislation, at work and any other capacity of life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter\u00c2\u00a0@IanHanchett",

      "content": " Sesame Workshop, which is behind the show, said the new initiative features Karli, a six-and-a-half year-old Sesame Street Muppet \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhose mom is dealing with addiction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The organization didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t specify the nature of the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health problems, saying only that the issue will be explored through an ongoing series of videos and other content.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFavorite Sesame Street\u00c2\u00a0characters like Elmo and Abby Cadabby learn what Karli is going through and help their friend to cope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sesame Workshop said in its announcement on Wednesday.  Sesame Street first introduced Karli in May as the face of the Sesame Street in Communities foster care initiative. The new addiction storyline explains that Karli\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was placed in foster care because her mother had to go away for treatment, though now she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in recovery. The show said\u00c2\u00a0there are 5.7 million children under the age of 11 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one in eight children \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who live in households with a parent who has a substance abuse disorder. It said one in three of these children will enter foster care due to parental addiction, a number that risen by more than 50% in the past decade. Opioid used can take many forms, including addiction to\u00c2\u00a0Chinese-supplied fentanyl, Mexican heroin and U.S-made prescription opioid drugs. Nearly 1 million prime-age Americans were dragged out of the 2015 labor force due to addiction to these substances, according to a report last year from the\u00c2\u00a0American Action Forum, a business-first advocacy group. After decades on PBS, Sesame Street moved to HBO in 2015, with repeats still available on PBS. Last week, it was announced that beginning with its 51st season, the show will debut on HBO Max, the new Warner Media streaming service that is set to launch in 2020.

Trump says they want to erase your vote, your voice, and your future. He says they will fail because in America, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe people rule again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump says just 19 minutes after he took the oath of office, the Washington Post published a story about how the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccampaign to impeach President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u009d has begun. Trump says they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t playing games. Trump is right. Here's the Washington Post story from January 20, 2017, published at 12:19pm, 19 minutes after @RealDonaldTrump was sworn in. #TrumpMinneapolis https://t.co/GrBMP3r6mv \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Andrew Clark\u00f0\u009f\u008e\u0083 (@AndrewHClark) October 11, 2019  8:51 PM: Trump says America has the number one economy anywhere in the world \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even close.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He says he is trying to make a deal with China.

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Attorneys Mark Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, however, insisted in a statement that the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with the politicians was limited to their role as \u00e2\u0080\u009celected officials,\u00e2\u0080\u009d not as candidates. The statement came after the Washington Examiner reported that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d worked \u00e2\u0080\u009cor had some type of professional relationship\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a 2020 Democrat candidate. Citing anonymous sources, the Examiner noted that Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general (ICIG), made the revelation about the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d relationship with the candidate in testimony before congressional investigators. Zaid and Bakaj asserted that the whistleblower \u00e2\u0080\u009chas never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0The lawyers, however, left open the possibility that the leaker did advise a current 2020 Democratic presidential candidate before his or her run for office. Two \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblowers\u00e2\u0080\u009d have accused President Donald Trump of improperly leveraging U.S. aid to Ukraine in return for it investigating Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblowers\u00e2\u0080\u009d claim Trump made a quid pro quo offer during a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Both Trump and\u00c2\u00a0Zelensky, however, have denied the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d characterization of their conversation. Zaid and Bakaj wrote in a statement issued Wednesday: In light of the ongoing efforts to mischaracterize whistleblower # 1\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alleged \u00e2\u0080\u009cbias\u00e2\u0080\u009d in order to detract from the substance of the complaint, we will attempt to clarify some facts. First, our client has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party. Second, our client has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch. Third, in these positions, our client has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not as candidates. Fourth, the whistleblower voluntarily provided relevant career information to the ICIG in order to facilitate an assessment of the credibility of the complaint. The lawyers went on to deem the original \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d complaint \u00e2\u0080\u009curgent and credible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d News reports have identified the original \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cregistered Democrat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The New York Times (NYT) revealed\u00c2\u00a0the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d shared his complaint with a Democrat-led House panel before reaching out to the IC inspector general, a move that\u00c2\u00a0suggests\u00c2\u00a0he violated the law. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whistleblower is not the story. To date, virtually every substantive allegation has been confirmed by other sources,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers said in the statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor that reason the identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d House Democrats are reportedly considering having the original whistleblower testify remotely with the face and voice obscured to keep the identity hidden from Republican lawmakers and staffers. So far, House Democrats have carried out the impeachment investigation behind closed doors. The lawyers representing the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblowers\u00e2\u0080\u009d have maintained relationships with Democrats and expressed ardently anti-Trump sentiment. Their law firm \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Compass Rose Legal Group \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was so desperate to find Trump administration informants that they previously offered discounted pricing to those who come forward. Zaid co-founded Whistleblower Aid, a small nonprofit that blasted advertisements around the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital actively seeking leakers during the Trump administration. One of the lawyers representing the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblowers\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Charles McCullough\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 is a former staffer for Democrat Sens.

A former Trump administration official also spoke with the\u00c2\u00a0Washington Examiner and claimed Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on foreign affairs put him in the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s circle either at the CIA or at the White House. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis person, after working with Biden, may feel defensive towards him because he feels [Biden] is being falsely attacked.

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " In June, the majority of 2020 Democrats running for president \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 endorsed a plan that would force American taxpayers to provide free health care to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens in the U.S. and anyone else who crosses the southern border. The latest study by Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) researchers reveals that providing health care to all illegal aliens would cost American taxpayers up to $23 billion a year should every illegal alien enroll. This total includes at least 2.5 million low-income illegal aliens and their children who would cost almost $13 billion a year, alone, to be given health care. (Center for Immigration Studies) Even if only about five million illegal aliens enroll in federal subsidies for health care, American taxpayers would be forced to foot a $10.4 billion bill every year, CIS researchers conclude. Overall, providing taxpayer-funded health care to each illegal alien costs Americans about $4,600 a year. With a scenario in which higher-income illegal aliens are enrolled in Obamacare and poorer illegal aliens take Medicaid, that plan would still cost Americans nearly $20 billion a year assuming every illegal alien enrolls. Based on current enrollment trends, a lower enrollment rate among illegal aliens would nonetheless cost Americans $10.7 billion a year. Previously, Breitbart News estimated, based on CIS analysis, that providing illegal aliens with taxpayer-funded health care would cost Americans about $66 billion every year and $660 billion every decade. This assumed that every illegal alien enrolled and each cost $3,000 to insure. While 2020 Democrats have made giving health care to illegal aliens \u00e2\u0080\u0094 paid for by U.S. taxpayers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a priority, experts have said that such a policy would drive \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong incentives for people with serious health problems to enter the country or remain longer than their visas allow in order to get government-funded care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds that the 2020 Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 health care for illegal aliens plan is the most unpopular policy position thus far in the race for president with opposition from 62 percent of all likely voters. Today, Americans are forced to subsidize about\u00c2\u00a0$18.5 billion\u00c2\u00a0of yearly medical costs for illegal aliens living in the U.S., according to estimates by Chris Conover, formerly of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University.

When asked about transgender military service, Biden said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I were president, you would not have to choose. Not a joke. You would not have to choose. The fact of the matter is that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a position where transgender men and women are in a position where they should be able to do anything anybody else in the world can do. There should be no difference. I mean it sincerely. You know, you know, my friend Sarah McBride. Sarah worked for my son as attorney general of the state of Delaware. When Sarah decided it with us time for her to come forward, and she came out. My son, being raised in the same family I was with my dad and the rest, my son, immediately moved to make sure the barriers for transgendered people in Delaware were eliminated because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who we are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is not a single solitary thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we should be doing everything from making sure they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deal with Title IX and cut planned parenthood back and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have access. There are so many things we did in our administration that increased the prospect of you being able to get every single solitary service you could get, including under the ACA covered by insurance, making sure you have to be, and making sure any surgery that was required would be viewed as necessary. And so the whole thing has to change. I mean, it really does. And by the way, thank you for your tour. My son served a year in Iraq. You served two combat tours, and by the way, guess what? You know we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to win this fight? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to win this fight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who has criticized President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syrian because of its impact on the Kurds, reportedly privately undercut his own support for the ethnic group during what he believed was a phone call with the Turkish defense minister.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " As Politico reported on Thursday, Graham was the victim of a prank phone call by two notorious Russian rogues in August. The pranksters, who go by Lexus and Vovan, have tricked a number of high-profile western leaders into taking their calls by pretending to be foreign dignitaries. In Graham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, the duo succeeded in getting the senator on the phone by impersonating Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar. Graham, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spent a sizable portion of the call attempting to dissuade Turkey from using the new S-400 anti-aircraft weapons system it purchased from Russia at the objections of the U.S. and NATO. Towards the end of the call, however, the senator also broached the subject of Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longstanding \u00e2\u0080\u009cproblem\u00e2\u0080\u009d with Kurds in northern Syria, even stating the ethnic group was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cthreat\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour YPG Kurdish problem is a big problem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Graham told the pranksters. He was referring to the Kurdish People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Protection Units, a group that began fighting ISIS as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces in 2015\u00e2\u0080\u0094with support from the U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u0094but is considered a terrorist group by Turkey because of its push to establish an autonomous state for the Kurds on the Turkish-Syrian border. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI told President Trump that Obama made a huge mistake in relying on the YPG Kurds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Graham continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything I worried about has come true, and now we have to make sure Turkey is protected from this threat in Syria. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sympathetic to the YPG problem, and so is the president, quite frankly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The comments, as Politico noted, undermine the tough posture Graham has taken in recent days against Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria and redeploy them elsewhere in the country.\u00c2\u00a0Graham has argued against such a maneuverer, which involves the redeployment of less than 25 U.S. troops and amounts to an abandonment of the Kurdish forces that have fought against ISIS since at least 2013. In particular, Graham and other backers believe such a redeployment will incentivize Turkey, who has also fought ISIS and Bashar al-Assad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forces in Syria, to move against the Kurds. To prevent such an action, Graham has threatened to lead Congress in imposing sanctions against Turkey if they were to attack the Kurds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile the Administration refuses to act against Turkey, I expect strong bipartisan support,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Graham said on Wednesday when outlining his plan for sanctions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost Members of Congress believe it would be wrong to abandon the Kurds who have been strong allies against ISIS.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

Restaurant owners can deny service based on so-called religious liberty. As a Christian, can you point to teachings in faith that state things like thou\u00c2\u00a0 shall not serve the gays meatloaf in diners or other religious verse that which provides instruction to the faithful to deny\u00c2\u00a0services or housing or other services to LGBTQ people \u00e2\u0080\u009d Buttigieg said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a great question. And without telling others how to worship, the Christian tradition that I belong to instructs me to identify with the marginalized and the greatest thing that any of us has to offer is love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cReligious liberty is an important principle in this country and we honor that. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the case that any freedom that we honor in this country has limits when it comes to harming other people. We say that the right to free speech does not include the right to yell fire in a crowded theater. A famous justice said my right to swing my fists ends where somebody else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nose begins, and the right to religious freedom ends where religion is being used as an excuse to harm other people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen religion is used in that way, to me, it makes God smaller. It to me is an insult not only to us as LGBTQ people, but I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an insult to faith to believe that it could be used to hurt people in that way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

      "author": "Donald Trump Jr.",
      "content": " By exploiting a leaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hearsay to turn an innocuous phone call my father made to his Ukrainian counterpart into grist for the impeachment mill, the Democrats and their allies made their objective transparent: They want the 2020 presidential election to be strictly about this phony controversy. They certainly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to contest this administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record in next year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election, and they definitely don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to test my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popularity with the American people. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d much prefer to leave the outcome of the 2020 election in the hands of the Beltway establishment and the elite-approved media. This Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u009cscandal\u00e2\u0080\u009d is merely a vehicle to allow them to do the latter and avoid the former. Let me be clear: There was nothing illegal, improper, or even remotely impeachable about my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone call with President Zelensky. Hunter Biden, on the other hand, took a $600,000-a-year job with a notoriously corrupt foreign company despite being woefully unqualified. This was almost certainly due entirely to his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perceived influence as the Vice President of the United States at the time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the same influence the elder Biden used, by his own admission, to pressure Ukraine into firing the prosecutor investigating his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firm. That needs to be investigated, as does the equally suspicious circumstances surrounding Hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trip to China with his father while Hunter was in the midst of negotiations for $1.5 billion in Chinese cash. Fortunately, Senator Lindsey Graham has pledged to invite Rudy Giuliani to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon know a lot more about those shady dealings. Whatever role Ukrainian nationals and firms operating in Ukraine may have played in laying the groundwork for what became the Russiagate hoax also must be investigated. My father has said this, publicly. Attorney General Bill Barr has said this, publicly. His subordinates at the Justice Department have said this, publicly. Why on Earth would anyone be surprised that my father would ask foreign leaders with the ability to assist those investigations to do so? Considering that the same Democrats who are now clamoring for impeachment themselves asked the Ukrainians to assist in investigating my father, how can any of them claim with a straight face that my father acted improperly, let alone call for his impeachment? As Sen. Graham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hearings will no doubt reveal, corruption has been endemic in Ukraine for many years. It would have been downright irresponsible for the President of the United States to ignore that issue before handing over hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. In short, none of them actually believe this nonsense. The Democrats are simply hoping to tarnish my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political standing before the voters have to start evaluating the choice between Donald Trump and whichever far-left radical the Democrats nominate to run against him. Indeed, the left\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hysterical reactions to Ukrainegate are just recitations of the same attacks they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been making since before my father was even elected. Deranged lawyer George Conway just wrote a rambling, 11,000+ word opinion article pretending to be a psychologist judging my father as mentally unfit for office. J.W. Verret, who briefly served on my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transition team, is convinced that Ukrainegate is worse than Watergate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009ca lot worse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in fact. Liberal journalist Paul Brandus goes even further. Not only is my father \u00e2\u0080\u009cmuch worse than Richard Nixon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brandus contends that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a traitor to America! Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this sound familiar? It should. Worse than Watergate? Anyone making that claim this week is obviously slow on the draw. Watergate one-hit wonder Carl Bernstein was\u00c2\u00a0using the \u00e2\u0080\u009cworse than Watergate\u00e2\u0080\u009d line back in November 2017. One of the men who wound up in prison as a result of Bernstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reporting, John Dean, was convinced that my father had breached the \u00e2\u0080\u009cworse than Watergate\u00e2\u0080\u009d wall in May 2017, just four months after taking the oath of office. George Conway thinks my father is unfit for his office? The same USA Today editorial board that published Brandus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ctreason\u00e2\u0080\u009d claim broke decades of policy to say the exact same thing\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 in September 2016, before my father was even elected. Speaking of treason, NBC News was accusing my father of treason in July 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 before he was even the Republican nominee \u00e2\u0080\u0094 over a joke. It only took another year for the Democrats to accuse me of the same thing without a shred of truth. Yet, they expect you to believe their latest hysterics about a phone call with Ukraine. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a joke, and not a very funny one, at that. Even the people making the claims reveal so much with their own behavior. J.W. Verret \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a professor whom the media is presenting as a former Trump supporter won over by the evidence of wrongdoing in Ukrainegate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was calling for impeachment months ago, when this Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d scheme wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even a twinkle in Adam Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye. Schiff, the Jussie Smollet of American politics, is trying to make this about Ukraine. As I hope you can see, it just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wash. This impeachment farce is solely about preventing a repeat of the greatest political embarrassment in the modern history of the Democratic Party: my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s victory in 2016. The prospect that the Democrats will be able to unseat my father in a fair election are fading fast. Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scandals, along with a series of embarrassing gaffes and apparent \u00e2\u0080\u009csenior moments\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the debate stage have crippled the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 putative front-runner, Joe Biden. The corresponding ascendance of Senator Elizabeth Warren makes it increasingly likely that the Democrats will nominate a candidate from the Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far-left wing, which is woefully out of step with the American mainstream. Democrats evidently feel that the 2020 presidential election cannot be left to chance. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to give the American people the option of making the same \u00e2\u0080\u009cmistake\u00e2\u0080\u009d twice. Nothing else adequately explains this impeachment push. Michael Anton famously wrote at the time that 2016 was the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlight 93\u00e2\u0080\u009d election \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the final chance for Americans to regain control over the airplane of state before it fell forever into the hands of Hillary Clinton and her vast network of swamp creatures, who would create conditions under which the people would never be able to choose their own destiny again. Three years ago, Americans rose to the occasion. They chose the future they wanted, and, since January 2017, my father has worked tirelessly to deliver it to them. The would-be impeachers on Capitol Hill are desperately trying, as they have throughout, to take that choice back and ensure that the American people are never given such an opportunity for autonomy again. They are trying to use the Ukraine hoax to override the will of the people, and they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even being subtle about it. Donald Trump, Jr. is the Executive Vice President at The Trump Organization.",

Mennis Award from the\u00c2\u00a0National Association for Business Economics (NABE) for their study finding that permanent tariffs on China would drive an employment boom for American workers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe effects of freer trade on the US economy are complex, and often negative for long-term economic growth and income equality,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ferry said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this study, we attempted to show that activist trade intervention like tariffs, if implemented correctly, can produce positive results for the US economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As Breitbart News reported, the study concluded that a permanent 25 percent tariff on Chinese imports would create about 1.05 million American jobs by 2024 and boost the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GDP by $167 billion.  CPA Chairman Dan DiMicco said the award is further validation from mainstream economists that permanent tariffs on Chinese imports are key to driving U.S. job growth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a very gratifying honor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d DiMicco said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt validates CPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longstanding critique of free trade. Mainstream economists are finally recognizing that faulty China trade has hurt America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s workers and domestic manufacturers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs Ferry and Byers have demonstrated, returning production to the United States can provide much needed growth and job creation for the overall economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d DiMicco said.

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " The details of their discussion are unknown, as press representatives for the Trump official and chairman of the\u00c2\u00a0Fox Corporation refused to comment to the Times. The report comes hours after President Trump ripped into Fox News, owned by Murdoch, for conducting a poll that found a recond 51 percent of voters support his impeachment and removal from office. The president also took aim at several of the network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anti-Trump personalities, including legal\u00c2\u00a0analyst\u00c2\u00a0Andrew Napolitano and daytime anchor\u00c2\u00a0Shepard Smith. The president wrote on Twitter: From the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m President!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.  The poll comes as House Democrats move swiftly with an impeachment inquiry against President Trump that was launched in the wake of a partisan CIA officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d complaint claiming the president pressured the leader of Ukraine to look into allegations of corruption against\u00c2\u00a0former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. President Trump and Ukrainian President\u00c2\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky vehemently deny any pressure was applied to look into the Biden family. To underscore no wrongdoing occurred, the White House released a transcript of the July 25th telephone call. President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Thursday tweets are not the first time he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criticized Fox News in recent months. In August, the president blasted the network for letting \u00e2\u0080\u009cmillions\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Americans down by allowing Democrat panelists and guests to push their talking points unchallenged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t working for us anymore!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he tweeted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust watched Fox News heavily promoting the Democrats through their DNC Communications Director, spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback by anchor, Sandra Smith,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\u00c2\u00a0added.",

      "subtitle": "CLAIM: The indictment\u00c2\u00a0Thursday of two businessmen with ties to Rudy Giuliani was related to President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 phone call with the President of Ukraine, which is now the subject of an \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeachment inquiry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " On Thursday, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York unsealed an indictment against four U.S. citizens, three of whom were born abroad. Two of them, Ukrainian-American Lev Parnas and Belarussian-American Igor Fruman, are political neophytes who are accused of passing campaign contributions from a foreign donor to pro-Trump organizations through a fictitious company. They also made other fraudulent individual contributions to politicians they hoped to influence \u00e2\u0080\u009cso as to advance their own personal financial interests and the political interests of Ukrainian government officials, including at least one Ukrainian government official,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the indictment reads. It is believed that these two businessmen were involved in Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to investigate the conflict of interest by former Vice President Joe Biden, whose son Hunter was a paid board member of a Ukrainian oil and gas company.\n\nBut the indictment does not mention the Giuliani investigation at all. Nor does it mention the Ukraine call itself. The only thing the indictment and the phone call share in common is a mention of the effort to replace the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. Paras and Fruman allegedly hoped donations to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongressman-1\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 later identified in media reports as former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would influence him to ask the administration to replace the ambassador. In a statement, Sessions said he approached the State Department, but not because the businessmen asked him to: rather, he said, he was informed by other colleagues that the ambassador was trashing the president. In the White House transcript (or \u00e2\u0080\u009creadout\u00e2\u0080\u009d) of the Ukraine call, the president refers to the ambassador having been removed already, adding that she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad news,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as were the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople she was dealing with in the Ukraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So whatever Parnas and Fruman were doing about the ambassador happened long before the Ukraine call. Likewise, their campaign contributions happened before the call: a watchdog group filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) about Parnas, Fruman, and two unnamed \u00e2\u0080\u009cJohn Doe\u00e2\u0080\u009d co-conspirators in July 2018, a full year before the phone call between Trump and the new president of Ukraine, who would not be elected for another year. Yet here is how the Associated Press explained the indictments Thursday: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe indictment contained the first criminal charges stemming from a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leader to dig up dirt on Democratic foe Joe Biden and his son.\u00e2\u0080\u009d First of all, Trump did not ask Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leader to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdig up dirt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the end of a long list of other requests, Trump asked him to work with the U.S. Attorney General and Giuliani to \u00e2\u0080\u009clook into\u00e2\u0080\u009d the circumstances in which Biden had the prosecutor fired while he was apparently investigating his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company.\n\nSecond, the charges do not \u00e2\u0080\u009cstem\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the July 25 phone call. They appear to be independent. One final note: the Southern District of New York has done this before, indicting former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen during the Russian \u00e2\u0080\u009ccollusion\u00e2\u0080\u009d investigation. The media jumped to the wrong conclusions then. They are doing so again today. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at 51 percent saying that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office. What say you? SEN. KEVIN CRAMER: I say let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see where the facts lead, but this is not a legitimate impeachment inquiry. This is unprecedented and not just a political process, it is a partisan political process that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely void of any due process. And in our system, you are entitled to due process. This is a circumstance where the accuser gets to remain anonymous and the accused gets to remain defenseless.

They want a fast prosecution before it unravels \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just like the Mueller investigation. That went so poorly for them, they were so embarrassed by it that this time around that they decided to just try a man by declaring him guilty before they even have the trail, before they even allow due process, before they allow witnesses, before they allow cross-examination or subpoenas by the accused or the accused\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies.

      "author": "Kyle Morris",
      "content": " McGrath, who lost a House race in 2018 to an incumbent Republican, launched her campaign in July and raised $2.5 million within the first 24 hours of doing so. According to her campaign, McGrath received 299,000 contributions, with the average donation being $36. McGrath\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third-quarter\u00c2\u00a0fundraising total outpaces that of several presidential candidates, such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who raised $4.8 million in the third quarter, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who raised $6 million in the third quarter. In a statement, Mark Nickolas, McGrath\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, claimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChange is coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMitch McConnell has never faced an opponent like Amy McGrath. Not only does a new independent poll show the race tied, but more than a quarter-million grassroots donations-from all 120 Kentucky counties-have provided us a record-shattering first quarter of nearly $11 million to take down McConnell and his self-serving special interest allies. Change is coming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mark Nickolas, McGrath\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager. McConnell, who has represented Kentucky in the United States Senate since 1985, has received an endorsement from President Donald Trump. In 2016, Trump won the state of Kentucky by 30 percentage points. Shortly after announcing her bid to unseat McConnell, McGrath received praise from many of Hollywood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far-left figures, including Bette Midler, Chelsea Handler, Patton Oswalt, and Stephen King.

She decried the left\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pursuit of socialism, which she said is \u00e2\u0080\u009cplaguing\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Democrat Party, and told the audience that the left \u00e2\u0080\u009cneed[s] you to be a victim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have the power and control over your own beautiful life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Guilfoyle said, encouraging attendees to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdream,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which provoked campus protesters, who shouted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbullshit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump supporters quickly drowned the protesters out by chanting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUSA, USA, USA!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The disgruntled protesters became increasingly vocal after Trump took the stage. He, like Guilfoyle, warned of the fallacies of socialism \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a narrative that prompted anti-Trump activists to shout, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfuck you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cCouple things I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to talk about because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sort of relevant to college campuses today beyond the sort of obvious suppression of conservative ideas and lack of free speech,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, \u00e2\u0080\u009csomething that I included in the book I have coming out in a few weeks called Triggered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI probably don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to explain to you why the book is called Triggered\u00c2\u00a0because you can hear from the audience just why that is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said amid shouting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut really, one of the things that sort of drove me to write that book is people ask me \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the son of a billionaire from New York City. You went to an Ivy League school. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to be a liberal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said as left-wing protesters stood up and shouted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you know why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump continued, unfazed by the protesters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I have a mother who escaped from some of the liberal ideas that are now being preached on college campuses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, mentioning socialism again. Trump noted that virtually no one from communist or socialist countries are able to vouch for the systems and pointed to Venezuela, which further triggered activists scattered across the crowd. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow about Venezuela? A once thriving country, beautiful, with prosperity for everything. How come there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no one from Venezuela talking about the wonders of socialism?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling a fictitious creed. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to buy into Santa Claus when you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the facts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said before pivoting to the success of his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder this administration, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a single economic metric where we are not better off today than we were three years ago,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, citing the historically low unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanics and the millions of individuals off of food stamps. The latter indicates that people are \u00e2\u0080\u009cself-sufficient,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is \u00e2\u0080\u009cscary\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the left, which only offers dependence, Trump added. Once again, protesters broke out in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbullshit\u00e2\u0080\u009d chant. Protesters could also be heard chanting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNazi scumbag,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo\u00c2\u00a0KKK, no fascist USA,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou put children in cages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet them get it out of their system. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said over the shouting.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re facing. You guys have a decision.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe difference between the sides are \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still come here. Because as my father said in 2016, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be the president for all Americans, not just those who agree with him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to cheers. Trump concluded his speech by thanking supporters for \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving the guts\u00e2\u0080\u009d to attend the event and urged college students to exercise the ability to listen and \u00e2\u0080\u009chave sensible arguments face to face \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not on social media where everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a badass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot behind a computer screen where everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tough guy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving that dialogue, respectfully, I promise you will learn a lot, and it will serve you well for the rest of your lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Protests occurred outside throughout the duration of the event. Activists from Planned Parenthood and March for Our Lives were in attendance, one of whom displayed a picture of Andrew Pollack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, Meadow, who was one of the 17 killed at\u00c2\u00a0Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA @AMarch4OurLives\u00c2\u00a0activist is using a picture of my deceased daughter to protest @DonaldJTrumpJr\u00c2\u00a0at @UF.\u00c2\u00a0My family has asked the group to leave her name out of their gun-grabbing agenda more than once. Meadow wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree with their agenda,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote:  \u00e2\u0080\u009cImagine being so desperate to strip people of their rights that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d use a family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, who was tragically murdered along with her classmates, to advance your agenda,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump tweeted following the event. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is what the Left does to good people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll always have our support, Mr. Pollack\u00e2\u0080\u009d: ",

Local\u00c2\u00a0Minneapolis\u00c2\u00a0Star-Tribune reporter Liz Sawyer noted there were several hundred rioters, and that some were singling out Trump supporters and surrounding them in groups before attacking them. Some also attacked police:    The scene was reminiscent of the riot outside a convention center in San Jose in June 2016, when anti-Trump rioters attacked Trump supporters leaving the venue in full view of the media \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Mayor Sam Liccardo blamed Trump.

Evidently, however, some of those among the \u00e2\u0080\u009cprotesters\u00e2\u0080\u009d felt \u00e2\u0080\u009chate\u00e2\u0080\u009d trumped \u00e2\u0080\u009clove.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In one instance, a bystander who was not a Trump supporter reported being attacked by the anti-Trump mob:  The Target Center had attempted to charge the Trump campaign hundreds of thousands of dollars for additional security. The rally itself \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with a capacity crowd inside and tens of thousands outside \u00e2\u0080\u0094 passed without serious incident, but local police seemed unprepared for the violence by anti-Trump rioters after the event was over.

      "subtitle": "Democrats like the latest polls on impeaching President Donald Trump, some of which show rising support. But in the long term, it is a losing issue. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) made it so when she launched an \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeachment inquiry\u00e2\u0080\u009d without waiting for the evidence.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " By the time Pelosi convened a fateful meeting with House Democrats on Sep. 24, Trump had already announced he would release the transcript the next day. Pelosi went ahead, anyway. After years of claiming that Democrats would wait to see where the facts would lead, hoping that Special Counsel Robert Mueller would deliver the goods on Russia \u00e2\u0080\u009ccollusion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pelosi decided that she could not wait 24 hours for the facts to emerge. She had lost control: behind closed doors, she faced a caucus that already backed impeachment: a majority of House Democrats had majority\u00c2\u00a0it since August 1, a week after Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony produced a dud. Regardless of her reasons, the decision was a serious political mistake. The rush to impeachment showed that Pelosi was willing to put politics ahead of facts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and ahead of all the other promises she had made to voters in 2018. The fact that she marched ahead of the evidence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which contradicted the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claims \u00e2\u0080\u0094 gave Republicans a reason to rally behind the president. It will also put an asterisk next to the 2020 election, in the event Trump loses. Pelosi repeated her error on Tuesday. The White House sent her an eight-page letter, citing the Constitution, the law, and judicial precedent, explaining why it would not cooperate with an \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeachment inquiry\u00e2\u0080\u009d that the House had not yet voted to authorize. Such a vote would trigger impeachment rules and procedures designed to ensure fairness. Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response failed to address the White House arguments, and accused Trump of trying \u00e2\u0080\u009cto hide the facts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The idea that the target of an investigation cannot insist on a fair procedure, and will be further implicated for trying to assert his or her rights \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) stated explicitly last week with Pelosi by his side \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is reminiscent of \u00e2\u0080\u009cjustice\u00e2\u0080\u009d in totalitarian dictatorships. It is, as Breitbart News noted last week, an echo of the horrors of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Chamber,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which the Framers who wrote the U.S. Constitution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bill of Rights were eager to prevent. Pelosi insists that the Constitution does not require the House to obey a set of rules or procedures for impeachment. She is right. But the Constitution also does not require the White House to comply with an \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeachment inquiry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If the matter is brought to federal court, the judiciary would likely decline to intervene, citing the political question doctrine. Pelosi will have to hold an impeachment vote without the public ever seeing the evidence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or the defense. There is another weakness in Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach. She is defending her \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeachment inquiry\u00e2\u0080\u009d based on the argument that she and her party are retraining a lawless president: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. President, you are not above the law,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she declared on Tuesday. But Pelosi herself is casting aside any set of rules. If the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alleged abuse of power is the problem, Pelosi and the Democrats are not providing an alternative. They are simply imposing their own arbitrary reign. It is worth exploring President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alleged misconduct in further detail. He is accused of doing what Democrats have said for years that President Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration had a\u00c2\u00a0duty to do: namely, to investigate possible foreign corruption by a presidential candidate. It was a matter of national security, they said, because Russia could use \u00e2\u0080\u009ckompromat\u00e2\u0080\u009d to control the president. (Many continue to claim Trump is doing Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bidding.) The difference in the two cases is that Trump took personal\u00c2\u00a0responsibility\u00c2\u00a0for asking that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Obama made a habit of avoiding any personal responsibility for anything controversial in his administration: he left that to underlings, then professed outrage when their misconduct was exposed. Trump not only made the request himself, but also repeated it publicly. He believes he has a duty to do so and is right to do so. That is a matter for oversight, not impeachment. It is telling that no one can name a single law that Trump has broken. After the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d raised his or her concerns, the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigated the president for allegedly violating campaign finance laws. It is illegal to accept foreign contributions, as two of Rudy Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s associates found out on Thursday. But the DOJ\u00c2\u00a0closed the case\u00c2\u00a0on Trump: he did not break the law. As Democrats told us for years, while their party might have benefited politically from investigating the Trump campaign, that did not matter because there was a legitimate public interest in finding out whether Russian influence extended to a GOP candidate. (Never mind that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee arguably broke campaign finance laws themselves by disguising payments to dig up dirt on Trump through foreign sources.) Trump can cite a similar public interest in finding out what the Bidens were up to in Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all the more so because Joe Biden has admitted to quashing an investigation into a company on which his son, Hunter, was a board member. Even if the Bidens did not actually do anything wrong, as the suddenly incurious media are rushing to tell us, there is no doubt that Joe Biden had a conflict of interest. The fact that he did not recuse himself was unethical. But if what Trump did was in the public interest, what about the\u00c2\u00a0way he did it? Though there is no evidence of any\u00c2\u00a0quid pro quo \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which would probably not be illegal anyway \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the idea that Trump used a personal call to request that the new Ukrainian president examine both the 2016 election shenanigans and the Bidens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 activities strikes some observers as odd. It suggests that Trump has supposedly erased boundaries between the personal and the national. Democrats interpret that as evidence of authoritarianism \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as they have done with almost everything else Trump has done. If Trump lowers taxes that benefits American businesses as a whole, Democrats and their media allies rush to calculate how much the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own business interests might save as a result. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has campaigned for months on the idea that President Trump is benefiting personally from such alleged \u00e2\u0080\u009ccorruption.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Democrats and journalists showed considerable less interest in figuring out why President Obama made a sudden, albeit unsuccessful, pitch for Chicago to host the 2016 Olympics when he flew to Copenhagen in his first year as president. Hosting the Olympics often costs cities more than it is worth. But several of Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chicago friends \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including, supposedly, White House adviser Valerie Jarrett \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stood to benefit from an Olympic-sized windfall. Trump does not operate that way. Indeed, the appeal for his voters was that unlike the Obamas, he had\u00c2\u00a0already made \u00c2\u00a0a fortune before going into politics (and risked a fortune by doing so). Rather than pursuing his personal interests as if they were the national interest, Trump has made the national interest his personal interest. As he said repeatedly in \u00c2\u00a0the 2016 race: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy whole life I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been greedy \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Now I want to be greedy for the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He is delivering. His style bothers some constitutional conservatives, whose ideal would be a president who operates more at arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s length. But Trump may be incapable of functioning any other way. Recall that he made his fortune as the head of a private, family business. He has never had to please shareholders \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and may not have succeeded if he needed to do so. For him, personal success and company success are the same. He has brought that approach to the presidency. That is why Trump often speaks off-the-cuff, even at ostensibly non-political or public events, about how his own performance is supposedly better than those of his predecessors. There is more than ordinary presidential narcissism at work (and Obama, unlike Trump, seemed unable to deliver even a prepared speech without using the first person pronoun incessantly). It is the way a family businessman thinks. It works \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but it rubs some people the wrong way. Democrats have an opportunity to provide an alternative to Trump by advocating a return to a more rules-based way of running the government. Instead, they are doing the opposite. Pelosi has made it clear that she will not be bound by House precedent and will not follow the basic rules of fairness in the impeachment inquiry. Much of the inquiry thus far has been held behind doors in intelligence hearings, which allows Democrats to leak out-of-context details. What Pelosi and the Democrats seem to be saying is that the normal rules and rights \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which Republicans, even in their own impeachment frenzy, afforded to President Bill Clinton \u00e2\u0080\u0094 must be suspended for this particular president. They argue no president is above the law. But no president is beneath it, either. And by protecting leakers like the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Democrats may even be condoning law-breaking for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust\u00e2\u0080\u009d cause of ousting Trump. That approach is not only legally and morally wrong: it is also politically disastrous. Before Pelosi ordered the impeachment inquiry, Trump was largely running against the \u00e2\u0080\u009csocialism\u00e2\u0080\u009d proposed by most Democrat presidential candidates. (In that vein, William Galston \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the liberal on the\u00c2\u00a0Wall Street Journal op-ed page \u00e2\u0080\u0094 warned Democrats this week that Warren, the new frontrunner, is too left-wing for voters in states Democrats must win in 2020.) Now, Trump is running to defend democracy. Democrats, he argues, want to undo the last election and steal the next one. They cannot be bothered to wait for the voters to deliver their own verdict, mere months from now: they want to usurp the power of the people. It is an argument for which Democrats have no answer. And if they manage to win in 2020 by using a partisan impeachment to tarnish the president, many Americans will lose faith in our democracy. There are probably Democrats who think they are doing what is right for the country \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just like there were FBI agents, starting with then-Director James Comey, who understood they were bending the rules in 2016 to help Hillary Clinton and hurt Donald Trump, but believed they were protecting the country. They acted as they did because they lacked faith in our constitutional checks and balances, and the wisdom of the American electorate. Pelosi lacks that same faith \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the proof is that she refuses to authorize the impeachment inquiry with a vote. If she believed the case against Trump were strong, she would not oppose a fair process based on rules and precedent. She told fellow Democrats that she was undertaking impeachment \u00e2\u0080\u009cprayerfully.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If so, there has never been a more faithless prayer. The Democrats are opposing democracy because they do not believe in it, or the American people. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Pull yourself together,\u00e2\u0080\u009d warned the Turkish strongman, who used a failed coup against him in 2016 as an opportunity to hurl thousands of his political opponents and detractors into prison, over moves by the EU to condemn his recent incursion into Kurdish-controlled territory in northern Syria. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say it again. If you try to label this operation as an invasion, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very simple: we will open the gates and send 3.6 million refugees your way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d threatened the Islamist leader, prompting a round of applause from his audience. Erdogan boasted that his operation had already eliminated over 100 \u00e2\u0080\u009cterrorists\u00e2\u0080\u009d and insisted his goal was to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontribute to Syria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political and territorial integrity\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 although his operation is opposed by the Russian-backed Syrian government which controls most of the country. He also suggested the leadership of the Saudi regime, which has also been critical of the incursion, \u00e2\u0080\u009clook into the mirror\u00e2\u0080\u009d, suggesting they had themselves caused \u00e2\u0080\u009ctens of thousands\u00e2\u0080\u009d of deaths in Yemen. Turkey is ostensibly a military ally of most of the European countries Erdogan is threatening, as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defence alliance.  Meanwhile,\u00c2\u00a0Mohammad Raed, a Lebanese legislator representing Hezbollah, the Islamist political party-cum-terror network, has been recommending a similar diet of threats to make Europe \u00e2\u0080\u009ckneel\u00e2\u0080\u009d to their own demands. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll we have to do is wave the card of Syrian refugees and all the European countries will kneel before us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the MP, in comments reported by An-Nahar, one of Lebanon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most widely circulated newspapers. \u00e2\u0080\u009c[The European Union] could not receive 10,000 refugees and yet they want us to take in 1.5 million,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added \u00e2\u0080\u0094 although in fact Europe has been inundated by well over a million newcomers since the onset of the migrant crisis in 2015, which continues \u00e2\u0080\u0094 albeit at a slower pace \u00e2\u0080\u0094 down to the present day.

      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren promised her nominee to the Department of Education would have to earn the approval of a nine-year-old child who claimed to be transgender. The invited child, flanked by the mother, asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you doing \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to make sure that kids like me feel safer in schools? And what do you think schools need to do better to make sure that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to worry about anything but my homework?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren responded: So let me start by saying, I want to have a secretary of education who both believes in public education and believes in the value of every one of our kids, and is willing to enforce our civil rights laws. It turns out that when the Department of Education was set up many years ago, the secretary of education was given a whole lot of power over the public schools, and over the rules and how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re enforced. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had some secretaries of education who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been better. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had one that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a whole lot worse. Her name is Betsy DeVos. And when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m President, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be gone. And here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my plan \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00c2\u00a0 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to find just the right secretary of education. But here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I plan to do. I want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story. And then I want you to tell me if you think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the right person, and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make the deal. Does that sound good? \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Equality Act is essential,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, referring to the House-passed Equality Act, which would establish the transgender ideology as law, and so outlaw and stigmatize any recognition of the complementary differences of women and men. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we can get five [Senate] votes, we will pass the Equality Act the next day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe urgently need an Equality Act,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0said Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would pass the Equality Act right off the bat, number one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joe Biden. The candidates promised to promote the status of gay and transgender people in K-12 schools, to roll back restrictions on blood donations, to appoint gay generals, and to subordinate national diplomacy to the goal of gay acceptance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would, in fact, curtail aid, curtail foreign assistance to countries who, in fact, engage in this kind of [anti-gay] behavior,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Biden. The audience picked by the pr0-transgender HRC was delighted with the river of promises and praise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis means the world to all of us \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I cannot believe this is happening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said activist Julia Goldman, an author of a podcast about gay politics. The Pentagon must treat male soldiers as if they are women once they say they are transgender, said Buttigieg.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe trans military ban is an outrage \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That is dead wrong \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00c2\u00a0I will put an end to that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Religious rights must end when \u00e2\u0080\u009creligion is being used an excuse to harm other people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Buttigieg said. Religious-based opposition to gay status \u00e2\u0080\u009cmakes God smaller \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It is an insult to faith to believe it can be used to hurt people in that way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Religious groups must agree to arrange adoptions for gay couples, said Klobuchar. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have\u00c2\u00a0got to have agencies that follow the law \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You have got to [endorse] adoptions for gay families,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  Warren jeered at critics of single-sex marriage and transgenderism. One questioner asked her: Senator, thank you for being here. Now, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the campaign trail, and a supporter approaches you and says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSenator, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m old-fashioned. And my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What is your response?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to assume it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a guy who said that. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to say, just marry one woman. Assuming you can find one! A moment later, Warren declared her deep belief in charity towards other people: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about what I learned in the church I grew up, in first song I ever remember singing: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is yellow, black and white, they are precious in His sight. Jesus loves all the children in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00c2\u00a0That was the basis of the faith that I grew up in. And it truly is about the preciousness of each and every life, it is about the worth of every human being. Former California Attorney General, Kamala Harris, boasted of her refusal to defend California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marriage law in 2008 from advocates for single-sex marriage. Tom Steyer backed body-changing drugs for teenagers who say they are transgender. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of that care should be available for all transgender youth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has to be part of the public [healthcare] option I believe in \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It is an absolute right, and this is a critical part of healthcare for these young people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren promised taxpayer funding for cosmetic surgery for people who want to live as members of the opposite sex: I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery. I just think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important and the appropriate medical care. CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcers excluded any possible critics or skeptical questioners who might spotlight the political risks posed by the candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unreserved support for transgender ideology. That ideology would change women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s status and rights, change education rules, and girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sports. Amy Klobuchar provided the only moment of disagreement when she declined to endorse a call for legal prostitution.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not in favor of demineralizing all of sex work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, but quickly backtracked,\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to talk with you for a few minutes and see if we can find common ground going forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The only loud opposition came from several attendees who described themselves as black transgender women, including one named Blossom. A second person rebuked one CNN announcer for a mispronouncing the person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00c2\u00a0is violence to \u00e2\u0080\u0098misgender\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or to alter the name of a transperson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A group interrupted the event to chant about \u00e2\u0080\u009cblack trans\u00e2\u0080\u009d lives. But Beto O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke pushed the envelope. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDiscrimination\u00e2\u0080\u009d against people who are homosexual or transgender cannot be tolerated, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00c2\u00a0can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, any institution\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that denies the human rights and full civil rights of every single one of us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He promised cheap anti-AIDS medicine: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bring down that cost \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We will take over that patent and make sure it is distributed to every person in America.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mental-health professionals should not be allowed to guide adults or children who prefer to detransition from transgender status or to change homosexual feelings. \u00e2\u0080\u009cConversion therapy \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 should be illegal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs president, I will seek to outlaw it everywhere in this country \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this is tantamount to torture \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a torture we visit on children who are absolutely defenseless,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Beto also promised a new policy to counter the murder of black transgender women, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey will be the guide on this issue \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they will direct our policy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Countering the murders is\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009ca matter of restoring the very fabric of America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

      "content": " Obviously I loved this, a) because being physically assaulted by a pasty-faced soy boy is always comedy gold. And b) because it confirmed what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve long suspected: there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really nothing peaceful or \u00e2\u0080\u0098nice\u00e2\u0080\u0099 about these posturing, deluded, \u00e2\u0080\u0098planet-saving\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pests. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve put the \u00e2\u0080\u0098planet-saving\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in inverted commas because the only place these soap-shunning losers are saving the planet is in their warped imaginations. Some of them are even honest enough to admit it. Here is one of the founding members of Extinction Rebellion (XR), telling it like it is on Medium: So Extinction Rebellion isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about the climate. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even about \u00e2\u0080\u0098climate justice\u00e2\u0080\u0099**, although that is also important. If we only talk about the climate, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re missing the deeper problems plaguing our culture. And if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t excise the cause of the infection, we can never hope to heal from it. This article is calling to all of those who are involved in XR who sometimes slip into saying it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a climate movement. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a call to\u00c2\u00a0the American rebels who made a banner saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cCLIMATE extinction rebellion\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a call to the XR Media & Messaging teams to never get sloppy with the messaging and \u00e2\u0080\u0098reduce\u00e2\u0080\u0099 it to climate issues. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a call to the XR community to never say we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a climate movement. Because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not. Yes, I think the piece\u00e2\u0080\u0099s author Stuart Basden, has made it pretty clear that Extinction Rebellion is not about the climate. So what, then, is it about? Basden himself doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to have much of a clue. At one point, he writes: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re facing imminent societal collapse (whatever that means), both around the world and in the UK. That parenthesis speaks volumes. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Imminent societal collapse\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is just another empty phrase to be brandished alongside all the other emotive catchphrases like \u00e2\u0080\u0098future generations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098time is running out.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But what else would you expect from a movement whose spiritual leader is a 16-year old autistic school drop out who thinks she can see \u00e2\u0080\u0098carbon\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the skies and who apparently gets her science facts from Ice Age 2? Elsewhere in his article, Basden has a good old rant about some of his other obsessions: In other words, Extinction Rebellion is imbued with the kind of pseudo-academic, post-modernist, neo-Marxist intersectional guff that they teach at universities these days \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and which bears a great deal of responsibility for the widespread madness afflicting our age and poisoning relationships between the young and old, between races and religions, between the two [nb] sexes, between social classes and so on. What also struck me as I wandered among the Extinction Rebellion crowds, feeling the loathing oozing from the ones that recognised me (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m quite the hate figure in greenie circles, for some odd reason) was just how blinkered, prejudiced and ill-informed these people are. Did they but know it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I did try to explain this to some of them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I care at least as passionately about the environment as any of them do. Indeed, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just come from a meeting with Mike Shellenberger, a green activist once named a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hero of the Environment\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by Time magazine. Shellenberger is a Democrat from the Peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Republic of California, founder and president of a think tank called Environmental Progress, and was an early campaigner for the renewables program later adopted by President Obama. Despite all this we got on like a house on fire because, though we disagree on some minor issues \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he thinks \u00e2\u0080\u0098climate change\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is a problem; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we agree on the fundamentals: the stuff being done to save the planet is actually killing it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and as nature lovers this drives both of us insane. Watch: Mike Shellenberger and James Delingpole talk Extinction Rebellion and why they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so wrong  We both agreed strongly that Extinction Rebellion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s war on economic growth \u00e2\u0080\u0094 among all the other things it would love to ban: air travel, cars, etc \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is the very last thing either the planet or future generations need. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prosperity that enables us to have the money we need to care for our environment. Poverty just makes things worse. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no coincidence that the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst environmental disasters of the last 100 years happened mostly either in the developing world or behind the Iron Curtain. But when you try explaining this stuff to the Extinction Rebellion crowd they just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to know. They are so convinced of the rightness of their cause they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want any pesky facts to get in the way of their belief system. I suppose they think just the same about people like me. Indeed, I know they do: the ones who confronted me, such as the chap you see on camera having a go at me, assume that everything I say about the environment I say in bad faith. That is, they all think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a wicked \u00e2\u0080\u0098denier\u00e2\u0080\u0099 who only says sceptical things about climate change and the environment because I am paid lavishly to do so either by Big Oil or by the rabid right-wing media. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I blame them for thinking this way: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been taught in schools; all they ever hear at college and university; all they ever read in the mainstream media or see on TV. They have been brainwashed and propagandised into green groupthink. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all very well mocking freaks like the guy dressed in the clown suit, and the weeping dad blubbing next to a photo of his children, and the idiots doing dances and yoga classes and saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cEnough is enough! This time we need to get serious about these idiots blocking our streets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by which I mean our culture, rather than you or me personally \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have created this problem by allowing all this junk-science, greenie nonsense these loons are spouting to go largely uncriticised by anyone, anywhere. Dissenting voices to the green fake news narrative are so rarely heard \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on the BBC, they are more or less banned \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no wonder that kids are frightened the world is going to end in twelve years and that XR feel morally justified in causing such disruption and economic damage and human misery. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has dismissed the XR crowd as \u00e2\u0080\u0098nose-ringed crusties in hemp smelling bivouacs\u00e2\u0080\u0098. And he has a point. But isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this the same Boris Johnson whose government is committed to making the UK economy Net Zero of CO2 emissions by 2040 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an aim which is not only impossible without causing tremendous disruption, damage and expense to British industry and consumer freedom, but which also has no sound scientific justification whatsoever? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave the last word on this to Matt Ridley, the Oxford-educated zoologist, now a member of the House of Lords, who is one of passing few politicians to talk sense on this issue.  Interviewed by Julia Hartley-Brewer, he said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat worries me is that the Establishment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in terms of journalists, politicians and scientists too \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have kind of talked a whole generation into this extreme apocalyptic rhetoric which is just not supported by the facts\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Precisely. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Establishment which created the Extinction Rebellion monster. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Establishment which continues to feed the Extinction Rebellion monster. And until the Establishment faces up to its responsibility for helping stoke up this green hysteria, the Extinction Rebellion monster will be rampaging amongst us for many years hence.",

      "author": "Victoria Friedman",
      "content": " The ComRes poll, seen by The Telegraph, was presented at a fringe event at last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tory Party conference. It validated the predictions by many Brexiteers that failure to deliver Brexit by the deadline will result in a major\u00c2\u00a0 electoral loss for the party. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis polling shows what every MP must know. The UK is yearning to move on. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to get Brexit done, on time, do or die,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Steve Baker, chairman of the Conservative Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Brexiteer European Reseach Group (ERG). Even a slight delay would cost the Tories an election, the survey revealed. The poll of 2,050 adults found that is the country left the European Union after yet another extension, the part would be 14 seats short of a majority if it was with a late deal, and 18 short if late and without an agreement. Only leaving on time would result in a majority for the party, either a 118-seat majority with a deal or 114-seat majority without a deal. The projections highlight the necessity for the Tories to deliver Brexit to survive as a party. However, the Labour Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent movements demonstrate that if the Tories do not deliver Brexit by the next election, there may be no Brexit at all.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn confirmed on Thursday that his first act as prime minister would be to \u00e2\u0080\u009cimmediately legislate\u00e2\u0080\u009d a second referendum. Mr Corbyn has said that as the leader of a future government, he would negotiate an even softer Brexit deal and put that option against Remain on the referendum ballot paper. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithin three months of coming to power, a Labour government will secure a sensible deal, based on the terms we have long advocated and discussed with the EU, trade unions and businesses, including a new customs union, a close single market relationship and guarantees of rights and protections. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithin six months of being elected, we will put that deal to a public vote alongside Remain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr Corbyn said. It has long been a feature of European Union \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d that national votes and referenda that go against Brussels\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interests are ignored and run again, this strategy having been used several times in Denmark, the Netherlands, France, and Ireland. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage remarked on the latest announcement, saying at a rally last night: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Labour Party \u00e2\u0080\u0094 genius \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will negotiate a new deal with Brussels, put it to the electorate in a referendum, and then campaign against it. Work that one out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr Farage has said that he is preparing to stand candidates in every seat in the UK for the next election to deliver Brexit if Johnson fails to do so. The Brexit Party leader has also made strong overtures to the Tories to make an election pact. A study showed his party is better placed than Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to win seats in working-class heartlands abandoned by Labour, so an alliance would be key to delivering a strong majority for Brexit. However, Mr Johnson has turned down offers of cooperation. ",

Further,\u00c2\u00a0then-vice president\u00c2\u00a0Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating the gas giant Burisma Holdings, which was paying Hunter Biden $83,000 per month as a member of its board, despite having no expertise in the energy sector. Biden later\u00c2\u00a0boasted\u00c2\u00a0before the Council of Foreign Relations that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was removed from his post.",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Thomas Kaplan writes in the\u00c2\u00a0New York Times that Republicans and conservatives have questioned Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim that she was fired from a teaching job in 1971 because she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cvisibly pregnant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In doing so, Kaplan writes, they have \u00e2\u0080\u009cemployed a tactic \u00e2\u0080\u0094 questioning a female candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authenticity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is at once often a sexist trope in politics and a strategy used against Hillary Clinton in 2016.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The article appears as \u00e2\u0080\u009cnews analysis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d not opinion. Unfortunately, for Kaplan, there are three problems. The first is that doubts about Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pregnancy tale were first raised by\u00c2\u00a0left-wing Jacobin magazine wrier Meagan Day, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.   Second, Warren has made a habit of telling false stories. For years, she falsely claimed Native American ancestry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and fundraised off (correct) efforts by critics to debunk her story, just as she is doing now with her pregnancy story. More recently, her campaign has consistently exaggerated crowd sizes at her events, and Warren has repeatedly evaded questions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even from well-meaning liberals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedicare for All\u00e2\u0080\u009d plan. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cauthenticity\u00e2\u0080\u009d is in doubt because she keeps putting it in doubt. Third, questioning a candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honesty is the bread-and-butter of politics. Journalists and opponents always challenge what candidates say. To claim that the normal course of politics is a \u00e2\u0080\u009csexist trope\u00e2\u0080\u009d is absurd. It is also an effort \u00e2\u0080\u0094 arguably, a sexist one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to shield a female candidate from scrutiny, as if she could not win on the merits. Joel B.

They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t travel a lot. I think there is a slight disconnect with North Devon being isolated, being rural, and low income. Perhaps they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appreciate the advantages of being in the European Union?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Just three days before, the Liberal Democrat candidate for\u00c2\u00a0Banff and Buchan stepped down after saying Tory Brexiteer MPs should be \u00e2\u0080\u009chung, drawn, and quartered\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJohnson, Fox, Gove, Davis, Rees-Mogg should be hung, drawn, and quartered, with each quarter being sent to the four corners of the UK to be burned at the stake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Galen Milne had written on social media. Jacob Rees-Mogg responded in typical good humour, saying:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cTypical Lib Dem. Mr Milne should get his facts straight. As Lord President of the Council, I am entitled to the privilege of being beheaded.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is not just the candidates who are known for their colourful language. During May\u00e2\u0080\u0099s European Parliament elections, then-party leader Vince Cable launched campaign material bearing the slogan: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBollocks to Brexit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The motto was passed down to his successor Jo Swinson, who said during her leadership acceptance speech in July:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I say Bollocks to Brexit I mean it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Party members approved at September\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference to back revoking Article 50 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 cancelling Brexit altogether \u00e2\u0080\u0094 without a referendum. However, that would only occur if the party won an absolute majority \u00e2\u0080\u0094 seen as highly unlikely, given the Liberal Democrats are riding comfortably in third place in the polls.",

Among those respondents, 15 percent of college graduates selected\u00c2\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh, with less than half of respondents correctly selecting\u00c2\u00a0John Roberts.

Additionally, an alarming 12 percent of\u00c2\u00a0respondents surveyed understood the relationship between the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment, with only 19 percent of\u00c2\u00a0college graduates selecting the correct answer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cColleges have the responsibility to prepare students for a lifetime of informed citizenship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the president of ACTA, Michael Poliakoff. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur annual What Will They Learn? report illustrates the steady deterioration of the core curriculum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen American history and government courses are removed, you begin to see disheartening survey responses like these, and America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experiment in self-government begins to slip from our grasp.\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. ACTA says that its annual\u00c2\u00a0What Will They Learn? report,\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cuniquely assesses the core academic requirements at 1,123 four-year institutions that together enroll more than eight million undergraduate students,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that it scores the institutions based on whether they require all students to take courses in seven \u00e2\u0080\u009cpriority subject areas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d According to the organization, only 22\u00c2\u00a0institutions earned an \u00e2\u0080\u009cA\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0for core curriculum requirements, and 137 schools failed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile most universities require students to take courses in composition and the natural sciences, curricular gaps are common everywhere else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said ACTA in a statement. 82% do not require students to take a foundational course in U.S. government or history.\n\n43% do not require students to take a college-level mathematics course.\n\n68% do not require students to study literature.\n\n88% do not require intermediate-level foreign language courses.\n\n97% do not require a course in economics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not surprising that public confidence in higher education is falling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Poliakoff. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmidst all the fanfare about the release of the latest college rankings this week, there is not a peep about ill-informed citizens, often underprepared for the workforce, who are graduating from our colleges and universities with mountains of student debt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy focusing on resource inputs, admissions selectivity, and institutional reputation, the major rankings systems drive costs up but show little interest in what students learn \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t learn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren detailed her proposal in a Medium post, painting a bleak picture of the state of LGBT rights under the Trump administration. She accused the Trump White House of weaponizing the \u00e2\u0080\u009clanguage of religion\u00e2\u0080\u009d and giving entities a \u00e2\u0080\u009clicense to discriminate\u00c2\u00a0against LGBTQ+ people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal contains a swath of promises of protections for LGBT individuals, the presidential hopeful specifically vowed to mix federal prisons, allowing men to move into women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prisons on the basis of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender identity\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather than biological sex. She said she would instruct\u00c2\u00a0the Bureau of Prisons to house transgender inmates according to their identified sex, much like the Obama administration did in January 2017. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan states: I will direct the Bureau of Prisons to end the Trump Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dangerous\u00c2\u00a0policy\u00c2\u00a0of imprisoning transgender people in facilities based on their sex assigned at birth and ensure that all facilities meet the needs of transgender people, including by providing medically necessary care, like transition-related surgeries, while incarcerated. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a reversal of the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mixed-sex policy in 2018,\u00c2\u00a0 determining that it would resume using \u00e2\u0080\u009cbiological sex as the initial determination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As Breitbart News reported: Critics said Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transgender policy would have created huge risks of rape because few people who say they are transgender have undergone genital cosmetic surgery, and few can pass as members of the opposite sex. For example, Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy would\u00c2\u00a0allow male criminals into women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prisons and pressure women-who-say-they-are-men to live in men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prisons. Sessions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 new policy marks another step in reasserting the normal biology-based legal distinctions\u00c2\u00a0between female\u00c2\u00a0and male. Those distinctions were being scrubbed from the law by Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pro-transgender policies. Trump has already begun reversing Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pro-transgender policies in K-12 schools, in\u00c2\u00a0health care,\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0military\u00c2\u00a0which now says it classifies soldiers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sex by using the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbright line\u00c2\u00a0based on biological sex.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren previewed her position in the criminal justice reform plan unveiled in August, which specifically called for \u00e2\u0080\u009cspecial protections\u00e2\u0080\u009d for LGBT individuals behind bars. This is hardly the first time Warren has courted the transgender community. She applauded a child who claimed to be transgender during CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Equality Town Hall on Thursday evening. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story, and then I want you to tell me if you think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the right person and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make the deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren said. Warren also vowed to provide taxpayer-funded sex-reassignment surgery. She outlined that position in her comprehensive LGBT agenda, calling for \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender-affirming\u00e2\u0080\u009d health care. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Warren said during the town hall. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important and the appropriate medical care,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. Warren, however, has not always felt that way. She said in 2012 that she did not find sexual reassignment surgery \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for a transgender inmate, specifically \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood use of taxpayer dollars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have to say, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good use of taxpayer dollars,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said at the time, only to reverse her position years later.",

The 109 House Republicans who have cosponsored Biggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resolution to condemn Schiff are: When Breitbart News reported that the legislation gained more than half of the House Republican conference, Rep. Biggs said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is time to hold Mr. Schiff accountable for misleading the American people in this unauthorized impeachment\u00e2\u0080\u009d of President Trump.

      "subtitle": "President Donald Trump announced an executive order last week that seeks to protect Medicare for older Americans and strengthen it by providing them with more choices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even the choice to not accept it if they would rather have a private, non-government health plan.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " Speaking to residents of the Villages in Ocala, Florida, Trump said while Democrats are seeking to expand Medicare so that \u00e2\u0080\u009call\u00e2\u0080\u009d Americans can be on government-run socialized medicine, he intends to protect it, keep it for seniors only, and improve it by providing more options within the Medicare Advantage program and reducing its costs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTogether, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re creating a healthcare system that protects vulnerable patients, makes healthcare more affordable, gives you more choice and control, and delivers the high-quality care Americans deserve,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump told seniors in Florida.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re strengthening our healthcare system to a level that nobody thought would be possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Though the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive order does not change any current policy by itself, it will launch necessary regulatory proposals by federal agencies, particularly the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Here are five ways Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive order seeks to strengthen Medicare: Within a year, Trump would like to see the HHS secretary propose a regulation that enables Medicare \u00e2\u0080\u009cto provide beneficiaries with more diverse and affordable plan choices.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president wants to \u00e2\u0080\u009cencourage innovative \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 benefit structures and plan designs\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Medicare Advantage, the program that allows millions of older Americans to access various private health insurers at lower cost due to Medicare subsidies. In his order, Trump says he wants to \u00e2\u0080\u009creduce barriers to obtaining Medicare Medical Savings Accounts\u00e2\u0080\u009d and to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpromote innovations in supplemental benefits and telehealth services.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Healthcare analyst Christopher Jacobs, CEO of Juniper Research Group, explained at the Federalist that Medicare Medical Savings Accounts are \u00e2\u0080\u009ca health savings account-like mechanism that gives beneficiaries incentives to serve as smart consumers of health care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo accomplish that last objective, the order references broader access to cost and quality data, \u00e2\u0080\u0098improving [seniors\u00e2\u0080\u0099] ability to make decisions about their health care that work best for them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jacobs noted. Younger Americans are gradually becoming more aware of the costs of healthcare services and prescription drugs. Many are using apps that help them assess the cost of a service or drug by various providers and pharmacies. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order reflects that the practice of deciding what is best for each individual patient does not end when an American turns 65. When more Americans of any age seek the best quality health care at the lowest price, the costs of those services will come down. The implementation of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive order would allow more older Americans to access to health care services through telemedicine and other technologies. Jacobs noted this feature could especially be helpful to seniors in rural areas. Very importantly, the order also seeks to take on states whose restrictions curtail\u00c2\u00a0competition in healthcare access and, thus, lead to limited provider networks in Medicare Advantage plans.  The executive order demands further improvement of Medicare by \u00e2\u0080\u009celiminating burdensome regulatory billing requirements, conditions of participation, and other requirements that serve as obstacles to more providers participating in the program, including physician assistants and nurse practitioners. In a press statement, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) commended Trump for taking \u00e2\u0080\u009cbold steps toward increasing the ability of American seniors to choose the medical care and insurance options best for them, instead of being trapped within increasingly insolvent government-run programs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAAPS thanks President Trump for the options he is granting seniors, and the physicians who care for them, in Section 11 of the Executive Order aimed at curbing the further encroachment of socialized medicine in\u00c2\u00a0the United States,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said AAPS Executive Director\u00c2\u00a0Jane M. Orient, M.D. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order wants older Americans to reap the benefits of learning about costs in healthcare services by directly providing them with rebates and allowing them to share in the savings of the updated program. The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive order finally demands a change in the 1993 rule that required\u00c2\u00a0Medicare and Social Security to be linked together. The Clinton administration wrote the rule that states seniors cannot opt out of Medicare without giving up their Social Security benefits, even though they had been forced to pay into Social Security for years. The order states: Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary, in coordination with the Commissioner of Social Security, shall revise current rules or policies to preserve the Social Security retirement insurance benefits of seniors who choose not to receive benefits under Medicare Part A, and propose other administrative improvements to Medicare enrollment processes for beneficiaries. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is unethical, not to mention contrary to basic common sense, to insist that American seniors only receive care through Medicare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Orient. AAPS added: Medicare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hospital Trust Fund will be\u00c2\u00a0depleted by 2026\u00c2\u00a0and over the next 10-15 years, counting the Trust Funds as assets rather than taxpayer liabilities, the Medicare program\u00c2\u00a0is only 71% funded\u00c2\u00a0under trustees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unfavorable assumptions, and 91% under favorable assumptions. Giving seniors the ability to escape this faltering program will help ease the looming crisis as well as give American\u00e2\u0080\u0099s access to options that work best for them, not government bureaucrats. The Clinton-era rule was challenged by a nonprofit group seeking healthcare freedom, but, in 2011, a federal judge ruled in favor of the Obama administration and stated \u00e2\u0080\u009crequiring a mechanism for plaintiffs and others in their situation to \u00e2\u0080\u0098dis-enroll\u00e2\u0080\u0099 would be contrary to congressional intent, which was to provide \u00e2\u0080\u0098mandatory\u00e2\u0080\u0099 benefits under Medicare Part A and for those receiving Social Security Retirement benefits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlaintiffs are trapped in a government program intended for their benefit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey disagree and wish to escape. The Court can find no loophole or requirement that the Secretary provide such a pathway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Under Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order, individuals would still be required to pay Medicare taxes, but if they chose private health insurance, they could opt out of the government-run program without forfeiting their Social Security benefits. Jacobs observed the proposal \u00e2\u0080\u009cstands as a common-sense solution to our entitlement shortfalls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter all, why should we force someone like Bill Gates or Warren Buffett to accept Medicare benefits if they are perfectly content to use other forms of health coverage?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he reasoned. Orient emphasized the need to increase patient freedom, rather than adopt \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedicare for All,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which will eliminate choice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWidening escape hatches from an insolvent program and other looming Medicare changes, that will deteriorate patient care and limit their options, is needed now more than ever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval rating was climbing, and climbed to 45 percent in the Real Clear Politics poll of polls prior to the media and Democrats launching their coordinated impeachment blitzkrieg, as of now it sits at 43.4 percent, not even two points lower. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, Trump disapproval rating has barely increased, from 52 percent to 53.6 percent. And as of late, in fact, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s numbers have actually improved slightly: a half point increase in approval and a half point decrease in disapproval. Overall, what you have here, with such a small amount of movement, is Trump holding remarkably steady during yet-another full-throated media and political assault, the likes of which we have not seen since, you know, the last one. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s especially fascinating is that during the Russia Collusion Hoax, Democrats and their media allies were able to drive Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s numbers down into the 30s, to as low as 37 percent back in December of 2017. This time, even with the hysteria of impeachment added to the menu, not so much. What I think this tells us is the voters are no longer jolted into dropping their support for Trump by a media that has cried wolf nearly once too often four years. In the past, the media could gin up enough hysteria to drive down Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval numbers, at least until the public figured out it was all fake news. In fact, in the Rasmussen daily tracking poll, the most accurate poll of the 2016 presidential election, shows Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job approval rating has not only climbed from 45 to 49 percent over the last four days, his approval rating is four points higher than Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was on this same day during his failed presidency. Obviously, these numbers can change, but we are now in the second week of Ukraine Hoax Hysteria, so as these numbers stand today, they are worthy of note. One conclusion you might make from them is that time is not on the side of the media and Democrats, is not on this side of this absurd impeachment inquiry. The plan, obviously, was to blitzkrieg the public into backing impeachment, which would force Republicans to go along with public opinion. For days and days and days we were hit 24/7 with screaming headlines and secret testimony that resulted in damaging (and selective) leaks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There is just no question the media and Democrats thought they had learned from the mistakes of the Russia coup and the plot to destroy Brett Kavanaugh: 1) Move fast, 2) hide your accuser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s) true identity, and 3) do as much as possible in secrecy. Trump, though, outsmarted them by releasing the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president, which none of his enemies expected him to do because they were sure it was a smoking gun. Well, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, but watching the media roll out their game plan as though the president had not released the transcript is more than a little amusing. I mean, now that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the transcript, stories, like this, that were obviously written two weeks ago under the assumption Trump would never give up the transcript, actually make me laugh out loud. Trump is also outsmarting the Democrats and the media by refusing to cooperate with what he correctly refers to as a kangaroo court. Good grief, this so-called whistleblower, who we already know is a registered Democrat, who we already know colluded with Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) to create the complaint, who we already know benefited by a sudden Deep State rule change to facilitate his complaint, who we already know is a crony of Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s(!!!), wants to testify in secret \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is the stuff of banana republics. This is not a legitimate inquiry, not even close. Somehow the media and Democrats came up with something that is even more of a partisan witch hunt than the Russia Hoax, and I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the American people seeing something so toxically partisan and perversely secretive as legitimate. Furthermore, if Democrats actually had the goods on Trump, if the media actually had the goods on the Orange Bad Man, they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to play all these games in secret and spread all these lies. If anything, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarkably steady approval rating show us the public is in wait-and-see mode. Democrats might be consolidating their own voters to push up the polls backing impeachment, but the public at large appears to be waiting for the evidence\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And since there is none, Trump is smart to obstruct and delay, smart to treat this coup with the contempt it deserves, because the longer the public is forced to stare at this Potemkin Impeachment, the more they will see it is based on bluff, hysteria, media bias, a desire to meddle in the 2020 election, and stark-raving fear of what the upcoming Inspector General reports are going to say about the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appalling, illegal, and unprecedented spying on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 campaign.

      "author": "Kristina Wong",
      "content": " Democrats have felt bolstered in recent days by polls showing public support for impeachment is rising. But most of the rise in support is from Democrats, Trump and Republicans are now beginning to fight back. On Wednesday, the White House sent a letter to House Democrats slamming the impeachment inquiry as an \u00e2\u0080\u009cillegitimate\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartisan\u00e2\u0080\u009d effort to undo the 2016. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe President cannot allow your constitutionally illegitimate proceedings to distract him and those in the Executive Branch from their work on behalf of the American people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d White House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote. And at a campaign rally Thursday in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Trump called it a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwitch hunt\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cinsane,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and warned an attempt to overthrow him would produce backlash at the ballot box. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) shared with Republican lawmakers this week an internal poll that showed that in 95 battleground districts, 67 percent of independents viewed impeachment as politically motivated. The poll found that a Republican candidate who opposes impeachment leads a pro-impeachment Democrat 50 percent to 42 percent in the poll. It also found that\u00c2\u00a0in districts that Trump carried in 2016 that are currently held by Democrats, the Republican candidate holds a 54 percent to 38 percent lead. Red state Democrats back in their home states for two weeks are coming face-to-face with constituents unhappy about their support for impeachment. The New York Times\u00e2\u0080\u0098 Daily podcast recently followed Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), a vulnerable Democrat in a red district who came out in favor of an impeachment inquiry, to three town halls, where she was confronted by upset constituents. Attendees shouted \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot true!\u00c2\u00a0 We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask for that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cFake news,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo your job,\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the town halls. Slotkin told them, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to wait for facts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009clook at them judiciously.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One attendee asked her why she signed an op-ed that came out in support of an impeachment inquiry before the facts were out: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re waiting, why did you send the op-ed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d One attendee told Slotkin that she liked her at first, but \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen you fell off the cliff for me was when you joined the coup against our president.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That comment was greeted with agreement from others.  The internal House Republican poll found that 68 percent of voters in battleground districts say Democrats should be more concerned about addressing issues such as health care and the economy. Throughout the country, House Democrats in red districts are facing anti-impeachment protests from Arizona to New York:  At a recent event for Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI), anti-impeachment protesters were removed from the line for one of her events so that supporters could sit in front, according to Deputy Press Secretary for the Republican National Committee Mike Joyce.       As of now, 224 Democrats support impeachment or an impeachment inquiry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than the 208 majority needed in the House to formally vote on opening an impeachment inquiry or to pass articles of impeachment. Republicans have called on Democrats to hold a full vote on opening an impeachment inquiry, which would\u00c2\u00a0afford Republicans powers such as the ability to subpoena witnesses. Currently, the inquiry has been conducted behind closed doors. Democrat groups are hoping to sway public opinion via their closed-door inquiry. Politico reported this week that a Democrat-aligned digital group ACRONYM is launching a $1 million ad campaign in battleground states focused on impeaching Trump. The ads will first run in five states with 2020 electoral votes up for grabs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and could expand nationwide.

She offered her remarks on Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edition of Dennis Prager\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eponymous radio show while discussing her latest book,\u00c2\u00a0Provocations: Collected Essays on Art, Feminism, Politics, Sex, and Education.",
      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " Paglia highlighted left-wing denial of the biological origins of sex, including left-wing framing of sex as an arbitrary and subjective social construct. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese ideas aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t based on any actual study of biology,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Paglia noted much of the news media\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambivalence towards the aforementioned experimentation on children: I think that experiments of unproven drugs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 drug protocols \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on children is a crime against humanity, and it should not be tolerated. It amazes me there is hardly any media attention to this matter. I think the future will look back with surprise and shock at the ethical indifference of the major media right now in the United States to this going on. It is simply not right. These drugs have not been fully tested, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using children as experiments? Boys forever are going to have, in adulthood, a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size penis? I cannot believe that this is happening without protest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine that the child knows his or her future identity at age three, or ten, for that matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Paglia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlash-freezing a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development through the introduction of drugs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pre-puberty, on and so on \u00e2\u0080\u0094 seems to me, should be recognizably, not just wrong, but horrific.\u00e2\u0080\u009d LISTEN:  Paglia reflected on her own gender dysphoria, speculating on how her maturation may have unfolded differently had she been exposed to ubiquitous contemporary left-wing characterizations of sex as a purely social construct: If all of this was in the air when I was young, I would have become absolutely convinced that I was really a man, and I think I would have probably been vulnerable to that fantasy until my mid-twenties, probably. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And completing my massive 700-page book Sexual Personae, in a sense, exorcised that. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Right from the start, in 1990, I was describing that book as a transgender construction. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a voice. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an other self. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never felt female, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel male, either. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00c2\u00a0I would have been obsessed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said this publicly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 prescribing puberty blockers to children is a violation of human rights,\u00e2\u0080\u009d determined Paglia.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The Biden campaign is taking an aggressive stance in an effort to dismiss the mounting questions and concerns surrounding the Bidens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 business dealings in both China and Ukraine. The latter has become a particular point of interest in recent weeks, following President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone call with Ukrainian President\u00c2\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky. Democrats say Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009cpressured\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ukraine to investigate his potential rival, Biden, who played a key role in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden served on the board, making $83,000 per month, despite a stunning lack of qualifications for such a position. The former vice president wanted the prosecutor fired and threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid,\u00c2\u00a0bragging about his ultimatum last year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m telling you, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not getting the billion. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden said during an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI looked at them and said: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he boasted. The Biden campaign, however, is warning fellow candidates to refrain from taking a shot at the Bidens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 business dealings in China and Ukraine, and specifically the role that Hunter played. A Biden aide warned anyone who \u00e2\u0080\u009ccalls themselves a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Democrat\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d from pushing the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscredited lies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If they choose to do so, they \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould be making a profound statement about themselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the aide said, according to Bloomberg. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAides to some of the other candidates in the debate say they do not expect their candidates to shy away from repeating their public criticisms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bloomberg reported. However, Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democrat rivals have largely refrained from talking about the Bidens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 questionable business dealings, focusing on party-approved impeachment talking points instead. The aide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warning follows the Biden campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blistering letter to New York Times\u00c2\u00a0Executive Editor Dean Baquet. Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield, who penned the letter, laid into the Times for running an op-ed by author and Breitbart Senior Contributor\u00c2\u00a0Peter Schweizer. She also accused the Times of spreading \u00e2\u0080\u009ca baseless conspiracy theory advanced by Rudy Giuliani.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bedingfield wrote: This debunked theory speculates that then Vice-President Biden somehow did anything reportedly inappropriate in successfully ridding Ukraine of a corrupt prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who the\u00c2\u00a0Times\u00c2\u00a0itself thoroughly explained at the time was derelict and the target of an international effort for removal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was especially troubling about the\u00c2\u00a0Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0active participation in this smear campaign is that prior to its reporting on the subject by Ken Vogel,\u00c2\u00a0this conspiracy had been relegated to the likes of Breitbart, Russia propaganda, and another conspiracy theorist, regular Hannity guest John Solomon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, ultimately demanding the Times to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublicly answer for these failures in reporting on this pressing issue fairly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A spokesperson for the Times said the outlet will \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy to sit down with Biden advisers anytime to discuss news coverage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the spokesperson added. The president torched the Bidens during his rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Thursday evening, asking the crowd, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hunter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cJoe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the way, whatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00c2\u00a0Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hunter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then they go to China \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and Hunter, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not too smart \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 he goes in, he has a meeting and walks out with $1.5 billion, billion with a B, $1.5 billion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow think of it, where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hunter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything really. Hunter, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a loser,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy did you get $1.5 billion, Hunter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

He has no agenda apart from answering the Committees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 questions fully and truthfully,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luskin said in the statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNotwithstanding the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luskin said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe subpoena was issued hours after Sondland was ordered by the White House not to appear for a scheduled deposition with the Democrat-led House committees leading the impeachment probe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d CNBC reported. CNBC reported on the text messages that connect Sondland to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with the Ukrainian president where the president spoke about efforts to investigate corruption in the country, including Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controversial involvement with an energy conglomerate while Joe Biden was vice president. According to the report: Sondland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s text messages with other U.S. diplomats were released last week after they were given to those House panels by former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker during his own deposition. In a Sept. 9 exchange, Bill Taylor, a senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, told Sondland: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sondland responded: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that [Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky] promised during his campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The White House legal team also sent a letter to House Democrats that laid out the reasons the administration would not cooperate with the various committees looking into Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alleged misdeeds.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren has been in contact with Gillum \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the radical leftist who lost Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gubernatorial race to Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) last fall \u00e2\u0080\u0094 according to the Daily Beast: And for several candidates, including at least one in the top tier, former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum is on speed dial. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), in particular, has been in contact with Gillum over the past several months, multiple knowledgeable sources told The Daily Beast. While the Warren campaign says that the vice presidential rumors are \u00e2\u0080\u009cbaseless and not at all true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sources who spoke to the Daily Beast said that their relationship is reminiscent of the search process a candidate typically goes through in order to find the right running mate: One source briefed on the communications said the two Democrats have been in contact over the course of the campaign and that there is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong impression\u00e2\u0080\u009d that Gillum is a possible vice presidential contender for Warren, who has risen in recent months to become a frontrunner in the 2020 primary, the source said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to win Florida, I would be courting Andrew and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a second source familiar with the conversations said. Gillum rose to the national spotlight after challenging DeSantis in Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close gubernatorial race last year, earning the support of celebrities like pop sensation Rihanna and rap star Sean \u00e2\u0080\u009cDiddy\u00e2\u0080\u009d Combs. Despite a strong backing from Hollywood, Gillum lost. DeSantis narrowly squeaked out a win in the Sunshine State, besting Gillum by less than half a percentage point, or less than 325,000 votes. Gillum largely campaigned on many of the far-left\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go-to narratives, such as Medicare for All, gun control, and increased taxation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 three issues that particularly resonate with Warren. As Breitbart News reported in July, Gillum is utilizing his\u00c2\u00a0private non-profit in an effort to register 1 million voters and ultimately flip Florida blue. His use of the private non-proft is of interest, as Gillum previously decried the use of \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark money\u00e2\u0080\u009d in politics. By using his private non-profit for such an effort, he can \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan disclose much less financial data, including the sources of donations\u00e2\u0080\u009d: Gillum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of the nonprofit, calling itself Forward Florida Action, is notable given the Florida politician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0warning\u00c2\u00a0last February about the influence of \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark money\u00e2\u0080\u009d in his own race for governor, referring to entities that obscure their donors.\u00c2\u00a0 Gillum is deploying his nonprofit for the voter registration drive instead of utilizing his political committee, Forward Florida. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The change came after the\u00c2\u00a0Tampa Bay Timesreported\u00c2\u00a0in May that the FBI had subpoenaed records related to his 2018 gubernatorial campaign. \u00c2\u00a0 This after Gillum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time as Tallahassee mayor was tied to an FBI probe into city hall corruption, a federal investigation that\u00c2\u00a0involved\u00c2\u00a0undercover FBI agents going on trips with Gillum. Like Warren, Gillum has called for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment and has remained a voice for the far-left flank of the Democrat Party. Gillum subtly addressed the reports of his conversations with Warren in a tweet on Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany of my friends running to beat @realDonaldTrump call me often \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about one thing: how to win Florida,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote, plugging his voter registration drive: ",

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Vulnerable freshmen Democrats in the House representing Republican-friendly regions, in particular, met at least some opposition to their support for the impeachment investigation in recent weeks. Some constituents even expressed support for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criticism of former Vice President Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alleged links to corruption in Ukraine. That was the case at the marathon stretch of six town halls last Saturday for swing-district Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL), Politico acknowledged on October 6. During one of those town halls, an unnamed female \u00e2\u0080\u009craised her voice after Casten criticized Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s [July 25] phone call with the Ukrainian president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Politico reported Thursday. The voter told Casten the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d complaint about the call \u00e2\u0080\u009clooks like a bunch of 13-year-old girls gossiping about the person they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In response, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCasten held firm in his criticisms of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often sounding like a liberal Democrat who hails from a blue district, rather than a lawmaker trying to placate both sides,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Politico noted. The news outlet described Casten as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdie-hard\u00e2\u0080\u009d supporter of the impeachment inquiry. In 2018, Casten became the first Democrat to hold the congressional seat of the\u00c2\u00a0Sixth Congressional District of Illinois as part of a nationwide Democrat sweep of suburban districts. Hillary Clinton narrowly won Casten\u00e2\u0080\u0099s district in 2016. During the July 25 call, Trump attempted to improperly leverage U.S. aid to Ukraine in return for it investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u009d claimed. Trump and Unrkainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have denied the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d allegation, which triggered the impeachment inquiry. The U.S. president has accused White House hopeful Biden of engaging in improper dealings with Ukraine while serving as vice president. A video ad from Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election asserts that Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid to Ukraine unless the eastern European country fired a prosecutor investigating an energy company. Hunter Biden served on the Ukrainian company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s board at the time. Internal polling\u00c2\u00a0indicates\u00c2\u00a0a storm is brewing for vulnerable Democrats in key congressional districts. Polling by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) shows most voters do not consider the Trump-Zelensky phone call an impeachable offense. A recent Fox News poll, however, shows a record 51 percent of respondents support the impeachment and removal of Trump.",

And in fact, I think I remember that Newt Gingrich did an impeachment effort, led an impeachment effort against Bill Clinton in 1998. Was that an effort to overturn an election? No, he was investigating stuff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe may find out that there is some there-there \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no there-there, but to call it unconstitutional or an effort to overturn an election, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reach particularly for somebody like Newt Gingrich who was involved in the last impeachment effort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

The border wall that the Trump administration promotes has showcased the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real attitude toward minority groups. How could they really care about the rights of Muslims living far away in Xinjiang? U.S. government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moves concerning Xinjiang are going against the betterment of the situation in Xinjiang as well as vital development and prosperity in the region. This shows that adding more Chinese entities to the blacklist and visa restrictions on Chinese officials are obviously geopolitical moves by the U.S. Xinjiang has made remarkable progress, with people enjoying human rights based on peace and stability. Having been through severe terrorist and extremist activities, Xinjiang has successfully protected the lives of numerous people and peace has returned to the region. It has avoided the fate of becoming another Chechnya. As Breitbart News reported\u00c2\u00a0last summer, victims of human rights abuse from around the world met with Trump at the White House as part of the\u00c2\u00a0U.S. State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, including Jewher Ilham, who shared the plight of her father, a Uyghur scholar sentenced to life in prison in 2014 for speaking out against the Chinese communist government. Ilham told Trump about the estimated one million or more Uyghur Muslims that the regime has rounded up and put in \u00e2\u0080\u009cre-education camps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d where evidence exists of torture and organ harvesting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was no such freedom for Uighurs in China \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not at the school where my father was a professor, not in public, not even in a private house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ilham said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead there are signs on the street reminding Uighurs that they are not allowed to be visibly Muslim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Wednesday in an interview with the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo slammed the Chinese government for its human rights abuses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not only an enormous human rights violation, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the best interests of the world or of China to engage in this kind of behavior,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pompeo told\u00c2\u00a0PBS. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a separate statement this week that allegations of human rights abuses are \u00e2\u0080\u0098made-up pretexts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for interfering in Chinese affairs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Global Times reported.

      "content": " Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E) cut power to hundreds of thousands of customers in Northern California this week as a precaution amidst hot and windy weather. Last year, the company was blamed for the Camp Fire \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the deadliest in the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history \u00e2\u0080\u0094 after a faulty power line was blamed for starting a brush fire that spread rapidly and destroyed the town of Paradise in mere minutes. The\u00c2\u00a0Journal editorial board declared Thursday (and in print on Friday) that \u00e2\u0080\u009copposition to logging and prescribed burns in California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forests,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as well as a litigious culture that makes it more difficult to hire tree-trimmers, have left the state with additional fuel for fires \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a situation exacerbated by severe droughts that only recently ended. In addition, the\u00c2\u00a0Journal argued that green energy mandates have cost PG&E money that could have been spent on safety: Two dozen or so wildfires in the past few years have been linked to PG&E equipment, including one last fall that killed 85 people. PG&E under state law is on the hook for tens of billions of dollars in damages and has filed for bankruptcy. For years the utility skimped on safety upgrades and repairs while pumping billions into green energy and electric-car subsidies to please its overlords in Sacramento. Credit Suisse has estimated that long-term contracts with renewable developers cost the utility $2.2 billion annually more than current market power rates. Earlier this week, the\u00c2\u00a0Los Angeles Times editorial board also blamed poor management of vegetation for the wildfires. However, it also blamed housing construction near forests, and the effects of climate change. Hundreds of thousands of customers were affected by the blackouts in Northern California, though power had been restored to most customers by Friday morning, according to a report by Bay Area public radio station KQED.

      "author": "Sean Moran",
      "content": " Rose \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a freshman Democrat that represents Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, New York \u00e2\u0080\u0094 said Friday that President Trump is the sole person to blame after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) started an impeachment inquiry into him. During his travels throughout Staten Island on the campaign trail, Rose has brushed off his support for impeachment, suggesting that he did not want to back impeachment of Trump. Rose pinned the blame on President Trump, claiming that he forced Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hand on impeachment. The Staten Island Democrat suggested that President Trump has to \u00e2\u0080\u009cprove\u00e2\u0080\u009d his innocence, rather than have Democrats prove that he committed an impeachable offense during his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not want to be here. This is the last thing I want to be doing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rose said.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut no one is to blame but the president. The president says he is innocent, so all we are saying is \u00e2\u0080\u0098prove it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But that is not what they are doing. They are not cooperating, and we need to\u00c2\u00a0get to the bottom of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Democrat Rose also blamed Republicans for going \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeaf, mute, and blind whenever allegations against the president are brought up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comment mirrors those of Democrats during the Senate confirmation of then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh. In September 2018, Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) refused to say whether Kavanaugh was presumed innocent. Hirono instead said that his accuser needed \u00e2\u0080\u009cto be believed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rhetoric on impeachment has appeared to have shifted dramatically. Last month, the New York Democrat wrote an op-ed in which he urged Democrats to focus on their agenda. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are in danger of losing the trust of the American people if we choose partisan warfare over improving the lives of hardworking families,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he claimed. Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message mirrors other vulnerable 2020 Democrat representatives such as Rep. Susan Wild (D-PA). Wild said last week that moderate Democrats need to ensure that impeachment does not \u00e2\u0080\u009covershadow\u00e2\u0080\u009d their legislative agenda. Rose also slammed former Vice President Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son, Hunter Biden, and his position on a Ukrainian oil company, Burisma. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was the wrong decision for Hunter Biden to be on that board. In no way, shape, or form should someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public service benefit their family,\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, he quickly pivoted toward attacking President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family. Rose said: But if we are going to question Hunter Biden, we should also question Donald Trump Jr. and the way his companies have benefited, and not just Donald Trump Jr., but the other guy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the one who is even less impressive. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his name again? Eric! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, Eric. New York Republicans have moved to highlight Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shifting positions on impeachment. Jessica Proud, a top New York GOP operative who worked for Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opponent in 2018, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStaten Island is Trump country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are very resistant to the notion of leftist elitists in Washington who are perpetually offended by everything. They view this as just an attempt to get Trump out, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how it is going to serve Rose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt cuts right to the heart of the brand he is trying to create for himself, that is going to go to Washington and not join the partisan fray. It puts him squarely in the Democratic camp,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Proud added. Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @SeanMoran3.",

      "subtitle": "Andrew Bakaj, the attorney representing the so-called whistleblower at the center of the impeachment movement targeting President Donald Trump, previously was a whistleblower witness whose public allegations scuttled the confirmation of the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominee for CIA inspector general.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " Bakaj\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original complaint against Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominee was filed with the office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Intelligence Community. The IG at the time was Chuck McCullough, who is currently working at Bakaj\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three attorney law firm representing the so-called whistleblower. Like Bakaj, the so-called whistleblower against Trump also filed his \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisclosure of Urgent Concern form\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the IG for the intelligence community, albeit with the new IG, Michael Atkinson. Bakaj founded the Compass Rose Legal Group, which is representing the central so-called whistleblower on the matter of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone call with the Ukrainian president. Bakaj confirmed that his law firm is also representing \u00e2\u0080\u009cmultiple whistleblowers in connection to the underlying August 12, 2019, disclosure to the Intelligence Community Inspector General.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bakaj previously interned for Hillary Clinton and did work for other Democrats. At the CIA, Bakaj helped to develop a whistleblower reprisal investigation program. Breitbart News reported that a search of Bakaj\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter account finds rabid anti-Trump posts such as repeated advocacy for Trump cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump as president over claimed competency issues. Missing from major news media coverage of Bakaj and his high-profile clients is that he was one of two former CIA employees who went public as whistleblowers to contradict the testimony of Christopher Sharpley, Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CIA IG nominee. As part of the confirmation process, Sharpley testified to Congress in October 2017 that he was unaware of the existence of pending complaints filed against him alleging he and others may have retaliated against CIA workers who lobbed allegations of misconduct at the agency. The exchange came when Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) asked him about published reports of pending complaints against him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there are complaints, if there are investigations out there, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m unaware of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sharpley replied. The published reports referenced by Feinstein originated with an investigation from the Project On Government Oversight (POGO), which first revealed the allegations against Sharpley just before the Feinstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questioning. Feinstein read at length from POGO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s article and even entered the POGO piece into the Congressional Record. The POGO is financed by billionaire George Soros\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Open Society Foundations as well as the Open Society Policy Center. As part of its recommended resources for whistleblowers, POGO promotes the Compass Rose law firm as well as Whistleblower Aid. Sharpley said it was possible he might not know about complaints due to a process that gives confidentiality to government whistleblowers but claimed to have been unaware of the filings. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when Bakaj and another ex-CIA employee, Jonathan Kaplan, stepped in and went public by sending letters to the Senate saying that Sharpley was one of the CIA officials listed by name in pending complaints that they both filed in 2014 and 2015. \u00c2\u00a0Bakaj said that his security clearance had been suspended and that was placed on administrative leave as part of alleged retaliation for an internal CIA complaint alleging wrongdoing. It was also reported that the Department of Homeland Security\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inspector general had asked to interview Sharpley on the pending complaints prior to his testimony leading to some lawmakers questioning his sincerity in denying knowledge of the complaints from Bakaj and Kaplan. CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani told reporters, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Sharpley has had a sterling 5-year career at CIA and there have never been any findings of wrongdoing or misconduct of any sort by Mr. Sharpley during his tenure here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The complaint from Bakaj alleged a conflict between the CIA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IG office and the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General. Like the current so-called whistleblower against Trump being represented by Bakaj, the attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own complaint involving Sharpley was filed in 2015 as an \u00e2\u0080\u009cUrgent Concern\u00e2\u0080\u009d form with the IG for the Intelligence Community. After his nomination stalled in the Senate over the issue, Sharpley eventually resigned from his position. In the 2017 case against Sharpley during the confirmation process, Bakaj was represented by Mark Zaid, who is senior counsel with the Compass Rose Legal Group where Bakaj now works. Zaid in 2017 co-founded Whistleblower Aid, a small nonprofit that blasted advertisements around D.C. actively seeking whistleblowers during the Trump administration. Kaplan, the other ex-CIA employee who went public against Sharpley, was represented by Whistleblower Aid itself. Whistleblower Aid took public credit for Sharpley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s downfall:  The avalanche of news media reports about the so-called whistleblower clients of Bakaj and Zaid fails to inform the public that at the beginning of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidency Zaid co-founded Whistleblower Aid. The group is heavily tied to far-left activist organizations and Democratic politics. In his twitter profile, Zaid describes himself as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-partisan\u00e2\u0080\u009d attorney \u00e2\u0080\u009chandling cases involving national security, security clearances, govt investigations, media, Freedom of Information Act, & whistleblowing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s twitter profile doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention that he co-founded Whistleblower Aid. That detail is also not mentioned in Zaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bio on his attorney website. This even though Whistleblower Aid has been actively helping the first whistleblower also being represented by Zaid by setting up a GoFundMe page seeking to raise funds for the purported whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense. The page already brought in some $210,066 with a goal of raising $300,000. Whistleblower Aid was founded in September 2017 in the wake of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidency to encourage government whistleblowers to come forward. The group did not sit around waiting for whistleblowers. Upon its founding, Whistleblower Aid actively sought to attract the attention of Trump administration government employees by reportedly blasting advertisements for its whistleblower services on Metro trains, using mobile billboards that circled government offices for 10 hours a day, and handing out whistles on street corners as a gimmick to gain attention. When Whistleblower Aid was first formed, the main banner for the mission statement of its website contained clearly anti-Trump language. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday our Republic is under threat. Whistleblower Aid is committed to protecting the rule of law in the United States and around the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d read the previous statement which can still be viewed via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. That part of the mission statement received attention in the conservative media. The sentence \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoday our Republic is under threat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d has since been scrubbed from the website.\u00c2\u00a0 The mission statement now only reads, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhistleblower Aid is committed to protecting the rule of law in the United States and around the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Speaking to the Washington Post just after Whistleblower Aid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s founding, John Tye, who co-founded the organization with Zaid, claimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not a partisan effort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then went on to express seemingly partisan alarm about Trump. Tye continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the same time, yes, the rule of law starts with the office of the president. Like many other people, we are definitely concerned about things that are happening in the administration. The decision to fire [FBI Director] James Comey. The lack of transparency. A lot of people have questions about whether this administration respects the rule of law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Far-left ties, Democrat links Zaid doubles as Executive Director and founder of the James Madison Project, which says it seeks to promote government accountability.\u00c2\u00a0 The Project features on its four-person advisory board John Podesta, who led Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 presidential campaign, served as Chief of Staff to Bill Clinton and founded the Soros-funded Center for American Progress pushing a progressive agenda. Whistleblower Aid co-founder Tye himself is a whistleblower. He is a former State Department official who went public in 2014 about U.S. government electronic surveillance practices. Tye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bio on Whistleblower Aid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website brandishes his work for far-left groups. The bio reads: Mr. Tye has worked at the Southern Poverty Law Center, Avaaz, and also Southeast Louisiana Legal Services as a Skadden Fellow. He was on the board of directors of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. The Southern Poverty Law Center is known for its anti-conservative stance and controversially publishes a \u00e2\u0080\u009chate map\u00e2\u0080\u009d listing groups that warn about radical Islam such as Jihad Watch, the Clarion Project, the Center for Security Policy. On that same \u00e2\u0080\u009chate map\u00e2\u0080\u009d are racist extremist organizations like Global Crusaders: Order of the Ku Klux Klan and United Klans of America. Tye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other former employer, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), is financed heavily by billionaire activist and Democratic Party mega-donor George Soros and is known for its hyper-partisan liberal activism. Avaaz, a radical group where Tye served as campaign and legal director, describes itself as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cglobal web movement to bring people-powered politics to decision-making everywhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The group has repeatedly engaged in anti-Israel activism. Channeling the mantra of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, Avaaz says it aims to \u00e2\u0080\u009corganize citizens of all nations to close the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Avaaz was founded in 1997 by the Soros-funded, partisan MoveOn.org organization and by the Soros-funded Res Publica activist group. Tax forms from Soros\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Open Society document donations to Res Publica specifically earmarked for support to Avaaz. Res Publica oversees Avaaz activism. The same year that Whistleblower Aid was founded, Avaaz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former general counsel and campaign director, Ian Bassin, in 2017 formed United to Protect Democracy. The latter is a grouping of former top lawyers for the Obama administration working to utilize legal advocacy methods to oppose Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies. Bassin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s United to Protect Democracy works in partnership with the Brennan Center for Justice, located at NYU School of Law. The Brennan Center is heavily financed by Soros\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Open Society Foundations and is the recipient of numerous Open Society grants.

This was in addition to the first-of-its-kind deal the Chinese government awarded Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private equity firm Rosemont Seneca in the recently formed Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, a deal that allowed the firm to focus on international acquisitions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the backing of the state-owned Bank of China, one of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098big four\u00e2\u0080\u0099 financial institutions, BHR had access to the types of deals that most Western firms only dreamed of, including IPOs of state-owned companies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schweizer and McLeod write, noting that Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firm \u00e2\u0080\u009cinvested in strategically sensitive assets in both China and the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They write: In December 2014, BHR became an \u00e2\u0080\u009canchor investor\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the IPO of China General Nuclear Power Company (CGN), a state-owned nuclear company involved in the development of nuclear reactors. Not only is CGN a strategically important company in China, it was also facing legal scrutiny in the United States. In 2016, CGN was charged with espionage by the Justice Department for stealing US nuclear secrets. As a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccross-border\u00e2\u0080\u009d investment fund, Bohai Harvest was interested in making deals outside of China. In 2015, BHR acquired Henniges Automotive, a Michigan-based producer of vibration-dampening equipment, alongside Chinese military contractor Aviation Industry Corp. of China (AVIC). Given the military applications of Henniges\u00e2\u0080\u0099 technology, the deal required federal approval. Like CGN, AVIC was suspected of stealing US technology for its purposes. Not long after the Henniges deal closed, AVIC debuted its new J-20 fighter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 incorporating designs allegedly stolen from the US\u00e2\u0080\u0099 F-35 program. Schweizer and McLeod conclude by asking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid the Chinese give favorable treatment to Hunter Biden to curry favor with his vice-president father? The American public deserves to understand what exactly Hunter Biden was doing overseas and the extent of then-Vice President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The timing of Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business deal is particularly problematic. His father was negotiating U.S. policy with China at a time when the regime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior had become increasingly menacing to U.S. allies in the region. Vice President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kid-gloves treatment of China during that trip\u00e2\u0080\u0094a fact which was widely criticized by U.S. allies at the time\u00e2\u0080\u0094also raises questions in light of the lucrative business deals his son secured just two weeks later. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BHR focused on strategic energy and defense projects, including U.S. companies specializing in technology used by our military, as Breitbart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Haris Alic reported: In 2015, BHR and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an aerospace and defense conglomerate owned and operated by the Chinese government \u00e2\u0080\u0094 made\u00c2\u00a0a $600 million bid to purchase Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company. The sale required approval from the Obama-Biden administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), as AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges produced \u00e2\u0080\u009cdual-use\u00e2\u0080\u009d anti-vibration technology with U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u009cmilitary applications.\u00e2\u0080\u009d CFIUS, which is\u00c2\u00a0made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies including the Departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, is\u00c2\u00a0required\u00c2\u00a0to review any transaction with national security implications. When the AVIC and BHR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bid was first announced, alarm bells went off in certain sectors of the defense industry.\u00c2\u00a0In particular, many noted that AVIC\u00c2\u00a0was \u00e2\u0080\u009creportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which it later \u00e2\u0080\u009creportedly incorporated \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 into China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s J-20 and J\u00e2\u0080\u009131 aircraft.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite the national security concerns, CFIUS approved the deal with AVIC, purchasing 51 percent of the company while BHR took ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter\u00c2\u00a0stated\u00c2\u00a0the deal was the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbiggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The acquisition of foreign technology is a key component of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aggressive \u00e2\u0080\u009cMade In China 2025\u00e2\u0080\u009d (MI2025) strategy to overtake the United States economically and militarily by dominating key technologies of the future (i.e. artificial intelligence, robotics, electric vehicles, 5G telecommunications, etc.). A 2017 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce explained the role private equity firms like Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s play in this strategy. The Chinese government \u00e2\u0080\u009cis injecting state funds into private equity to fund foreign acquisitions\u00e2\u0080\u009d of companies with technology identified as a priority for MI2025, according to the report. In his extensive report last February on China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhole-of-state\u00e2\u0080\u009d strategy for global dominance, Florida Senator Marco Rubio also noted\u00c2\u00a0the communist regime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reliance on \u00e2\u0080\u009cintellectual property acquisitions\u00e2\u0080\u009d to achieve its ambitions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is becoming a significant shareholder in U.S. industries, and is selectively targeting those with strategic implications,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matt Stoller and Lucas Kunce wrote in The American Conservative last June. Their analysis exposes the extend to which China has co-opted Wall Street against the longterm interests of the American economy and national security. For example, they write: Jennifer M. Harris, an expert in global markets with experience at the U.S. State Department and the U.S. National Intelligence Council, researched a\u00c2\u00a0recent explosion\u00c2\u00a0of Chinese strategic investment in American technology companies. She found that China has systematically targeted U.S. greenfield investments, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctechnology goods (especially semiconductors), R&D networks, and advanced manufacturing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorneys told ABC News last June that Biden still sits on BHR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s board and owns a minority stake in the fund. At his campaign rally in Minneapolis yesterday, President Trump called out Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business dealings with China while his father was negotiating U.S. policy with the communist regime. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBiden allowed China to rip off America for eight years as vice president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump told the crowd. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and we are not doing that anymore. Those days are over. The Bidens got rich, and that is substantiated, while America got robbed. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends sold out America.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The House Democrat impeachment inquiry has brought renewed interest in the sweetheart deals Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private equity firm secured while his father was vice president, as detailed in Schweizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2018 bestseller\u00c2\u00a0Secret Empires. Democrats allege that President Trump attempted to coerce the Ukrainians into investigating corruption charges against former Vice President Biden during a July phone with his Ukrainian counterpart. The allegation centers around\u00c2\u00a0Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lucrative dealings with a Ukrainian oligarch-owned energy company at a time when his father was mediating U.S. policy towards Ukraine. The natural gas firm Burisma Holdings paid Hunter Biden over $50,000 per month for his work as a board member, despite his total lack of experience in Ukraine or the energy sector. Just a few months prior to landing this Ukrainian deal, Hunter Biden had been dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Navy Reserve for testing positive to cocaine use. A Ukrainian corruption probe into Burisma Holdings was scuttled in 2016, when Vice President Biden\u00c2\u00a0threatened\u00c2\u00a0to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to the country if the Ukrainian government did not fire the prosecutor who launched the corruption investigation. Withholding the loans would have thrown the former Soviet republic into insolvency at a time when it was fending off attacks from Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Russia. Both Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denied the Democrats claim that Trump delayed military funding to Ukrainian in order to pressure Zelensky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government to investigate the Bidens. The Trump White House has refused to cooperate with the Democrat impeachment inquiry, declaring it a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartisan and unconstitutional\u00e2\u0080\u009d investigation.

      "content": " The two-time Oscar-winning star said she wants to see fossil fuels phased out over 30 years and wants the government to stop leasing permits for fossil fuel development on public lands and waters. The 81-year-old Jane Fonda was arrested Friday after she and a group of fellow sign-wielding agitators refused to move from\u00c2\u00a0the steps of the U.S. Capitol building where she was participating in her \u00e2\u0080\u009cFire Drill Fridays\u00e2\u0080\u009d protest for the environment. In a recent interview, Fonda said that she convinced Netflix to give her four months off before shooting the final season of Grace and Frankie. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I went to Ted Sarandos who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the [chief content officer] of Netflix, and I asked him if he could give me a year off,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told the Los Angeles Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd he tried and couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t because of the contracts. I mean, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of actors in the mix. And so four months is what I could get. And then when we finish, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a longer season because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out last season.

We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to wait.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The Netflix star said she was inspired by young people, including 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, I knew about Greta, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know she was on the spectrum.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " President Donald Trump announced the USMCA one year ago, after extensive negotiations with both Canada and Mexico. The trade deal will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which Trump has long criticized and which he promised to replace. The new deal includes terms more favorable to U.S. businesses and workers, and is one of the most significant economic and foreign policy achievements of the Trump presidency. While Democrats have spoken favorably about the USMCA, they have also suggested changes to the agreement. They are also reluctant to acknowledge Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success and to approve anything for which he will later take credit.

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " In written testimony prepared for her deposition in the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 impeachment inquiry, Yovanovitch declared that she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cabruptly\u00e2\u0080\u009d told to return to Washington in late April. Yovanovitch served as the American ambassador to Ukraine from August 2016 through May 20, 2019. She now serves as a State Department fellow at Georgetown University. In her written remarks, obtained by the Washington Post and other news outlets, the former ambassador noted that she met with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan to discuss \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy my posting ended so suddenly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding: He said that the President had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador. He added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the [State] Department had been under pressure from the President to remove me since the Summer of 2018. He also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause. I departed Ukraine for good this past May. Yovanovitch testified before House Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry despite the White House indicating earlier this week it would block all officials from testifying. In a letter to House Democrat leaders, the White House dismissed the probe as unfair and \u00e2\u0080\u009cillegitimate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Trump administration attempted to block her deposition, prompting House Democrats to issue a subpoena for her appearance that ultimately compelled her to testify, the chairmen of the House panels leading the impeachment probe said in a joint statement. On Tuesday, the State Department ordered U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland not to testify, prompting House Democrats to subpoena him. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the following day vowed that his department would fulfill its legal obligations in responding to the impeachment inquiry. Pompeo noted, however, that the State Department would take its cues from the White House Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported in early October that Trump ousted Yovanovitch \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter months of complaints from allies outside the administration, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, that she was undermining him abroad and obstructing efforts to persuade Kyiv to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. \u00e2\u0080\u009d The former ambassador denied those allegations in her written remarks, saying: [F]ictitious is the notion that I am disloyal to President Trump. I have heard the allegation in the media that I supposedly told the Embassy team to ignore the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders \u00e2\u0080\u009csince he was going to be impeached.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That allegation is false. I have never said such a thing, to my Embassy colleagues or to anyone else. Next, the Obama administration did not ask me to help the Clinton campaign or harm the Trump campaign, nor would I have taken any such steps if they had.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nAlthough I understand that I served at the pleasure of the President, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an Ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives. The former ambassador said she had \u00e2\u0080\u009cminimal contacts\u00e2\u0080\u009d with Giuliani. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d complaint fueling the impeachment inquiry mentions Yovanovitch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ouster as an example of what the leaker described as the U.S. president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abuse of power. According to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhistleblower,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump attempted to coerce Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating allegations of corruption against Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange for aid during a July 25 call. Trump and Zelensky have denied the allegations. A partial transcript of the calls released by the White House cites Trump as telling Zelensky the former U.S. ambassador is \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad news.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

Trump said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at what they tried to do to me for three years. I mean, these clowns tried to put me in jail for three years because I took an unsolicited phone call. You know, the double standard is pretty sick, Brian. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about it for a long time. We can play one way, or we can play another way, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to be playing the same game. The reality is this: If Donald Trump Jr. flew on Air Force One with my father,\u00c2\u00a0the president,\u00c2\u00a0to China and came back with $1.5 \u00e2\u0080\u0094not $1.5 billion, just $1.5\u00e2\u0080\u0094we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d solve the fake news media problem because their heads would explode.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a double standard. If Donald Trump Jr. had a no-show gig on a corrupt Ukrainian oil company while my father was in charge of the issues over there\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 minor details. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been in energy or oil. Minor details. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak Ukrainian\u00e2\u0080\u00a6You think the press would have a problem with that, Brian?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had the media camped out in front of my apartment for two years. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even try to find this guy to even get a comment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He concluded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not fair.

When the Court ruled in the 2008 Heller case that the Second Amendment protected a fundamental right, it was clear that this right belongs to everyone, not just the residents of an individual state. The Seventh Circuit held in Moore v. Madigan that the carrying of firearms in public for self-defense is a fundamental right, but under existing Illinois restrictions, that right has been limited to Illinois residents and citizens from only four other states. On December 11, 2012, Breitbart News reported the Seventh Circuit ruling that brought concealed carry to Illinois. Judge Richard Posner wrote the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Majority Opinion, saying: We are disinclined to engage in another round of historical analysis to determine whether eighteenth-century America understood the Second Amendment to include a right to bear guns outside the home. The Supreme Court has decided that the amendment confers a right to bear arms for self-defense, which is as important outside the home as inside. SAF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pursuit of a SCOTUS review is joined by the Illinois State Rifle Association (ISRA), Illinois Carry, and nine private citizens.

      "subtitle": "Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish girl who has become the international face of the youth climate change movement, has been passed up by the Peace Research Institute in Oslo for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": " Thunberg was a bookmaker favorite to win the prize, and her almost 3 million Twitter followers also were hopeful she would win for her attempt to convince world leaders that the United Nations is correct in its estimation that man-made climate change could lead to mass extinction. But the prize committee disagreed. It chose Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who put in place a peace process to finally end a 20-year conflict with neighboring Eritrea. But the Washington Post reported Thunberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cause may not be the right vehicle for a peace prize, and then tried to make the case that it should be. According to the report: Henrik Urdal, the head of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo, omitted Thunberg from the\u00c2\u00a0Nobel Peace Prize shortlist he publishes.\u00c2\u00a0He explained his decision to the Washington Post, saying there \u00e2\u0080\u009cisn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scientific consensus that there is a linear relationship between climate change \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or resource scarcity, more broadly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and armed conflict.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The link between climate change and conflict is hotly debated. But climate change scholars say that while there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a straightforward relationship,\u00c2\u00a0there is a recognition that climate change adds to stresses in regions that could spark political instability and conditions that could foster conflict. The Pentagon has called climate change a\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cthreat multiplier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The prize has gone to environmental champions before. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and former vice president Al Gore won \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In 2004, it was given to Wangari Maathai \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In 1970, it went to Norman Borlaug, sometimes called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfather of the green revolution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Urdal told the Post that those awards could be a thing of the past because of what Alfred Nobel hoped the prize would represent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn his will outlining the prize, Nobel wrote that the recipient should be someone who has advanced the \u00e2\u0080\u0098abolition or reduction of standing armies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which some have interpreted as requiring a direct connection to peace and conflict,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Post reported. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you make it too broad, it becomes a bit meaningless,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Urdal said. The Post then checked in with a politics professor at the University of Oslo, who called Thunberg a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwild card\u00e2\u0080\u009d nominee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe link between climate change and conflict is still \u00e2\u0080\u0098quite tenuous at this point,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said in the Post report. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone sees flooding can cause conflict, migration and so on, but this is no way well established as a security policy issue yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Post also speculated that it could have been poor timing for Thunberg since the committee puts together its shortlist of nominees at the end of January \u00e2\u0080\u0094 before the teen made a splash with her transatlantic sail from Europe to New York on a solar-powered racing yacht and her fiery speech at the United Nations calling out adults for failing to address climate change. On Friday when the announcement was made Thunberg was in Denver with other teens who skipped school to protest climate change. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

Stiller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rant referenced comments President Trump made during his rally in Minnesota on Thursday night, in which he said \u00e2\u0080\u009cI promise you as president I will give local communities a greater say on refugee policy and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince coming to office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85 percent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I signed an executive order that no refugees will be resettled in any state without the expressed written consent of that city or that state.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stiller, who rarely publicly chimes in on political issues, has served since last year as\u00c2\u00a0Goodwill Ambassador for UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency.

A photo memorial of 20-year-old college student Jared Vargas, a loving brother to his twin and little sister, who was murdered by an illegal alien in June 2018. (Photo via Facebook) Vargas, a cybersecurity student at the University of Texas at San Antonio, was found murdered by Esquivel-Garcia on June 18, 2018, when firefighters arrived at the scene of an apartment set ablaze. Prosecutors said the illegal alien had brutally strangled and stabbed Vargas to death before setting his body on fire in the apartment complex.\u00c2\u00a0Throughout the trial, Esquivel-Garcia and his attorneys had used a defense and smear against Vargas to justify the murder, claiming that the illegal alien killed Vargas in self-defense because he believed that he was under threat of being sexually assaulted. The murder occurred after Esquivel-Garcia had been twice released from police and federal custody back into the U.S. and was only given a voluntary deportation order despite having a criminal record. In March 2017, the illegal alien was arrested for drunk driving and was eventually turned over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. Though he was placed into deportation proceedings, an immigration judge allowed him to post bond, and he was released back into the interior of the country. In May 2018, a month before Vargas was murdered, Esquivel-Garcia was again put into ICE custody and local police custody but was able to post bond and be released back into the U.S. with only the promise that he would self-deport. Esquivel-Garcia is eligible for parole in 30 years, and if ever released on parole, he will be deported by federal immigration officials to Mexico. Jared Vargas leaves behind his twin brother, in college, and a little sister, in high school, as well as his parents and countless loved ones and friends. A\u00c2\u00a0GoFundMe page\u00c2\u00a0has been set up in his honor to help his twin brother and little sister in their schooling. John Binder is a reporter\u00c2\u00a0for Breitbart News.

      "author": "Charlie Spiering",
      "content": " The president spoke about the future deal during remarks with reporters in the Oval Office at the White House after a meeting with Vice Premier of China H.E. Liu He. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to a very substantial phase one deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, noting that it would soon be written and signed by both parties. The president said that China had agreed to $40 billion to $50 billion in agricultural purchases, as well as an agreement on intellectual property and financial services. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the largest order in the history of agriculture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. He said he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcited\u00e2\u0080\u009d that farmers would experience a big economic boost as a result of the deal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to buy more land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, questioning whether farmers could even produce enough agricultural products. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that they had also reached an agreement surrounding China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currency after the United States labeled the country as a currency manipulator. Trump said that the deal was still \u00e2\u0080\u009csubject to getting written,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that the\u00c2\u00a0scheduled tariff hike from 25 percent to 30 percent on October 15 would not take place as a result of the agreement. Trump said he would likely sign the potential deal with President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in Chile in November. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it should be a problem getting it papered,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, referring to the agreement. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the Chinese technology Huawei was not part of the deal and would be dealt with separately. The stock market jumped over 500 points on Friday in reaction to the news but closed at 315 points. Lighthizer confirmed the scheduled December 15 tariffs would remain in place for now. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty of time to make that decision,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lighthizer said. Trump said that it was possible that phase two and phase three part of the deal would happen afterward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongratulations on the 70th\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, referring to the Chinese Communist party in China celebrating their 70th anniversary. He described the military parade and event \u00e2\u0080\u009camazing to watch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Vice Premier thanked Trump for his congratulatory remarks about the Chinese government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anniversary and expressed optimism about the future talks between the two countries. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have made substantial progress in many fields, and we are very happy about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Liu said. Liu also presented Trump with a letter from Xi Jinping to the president who took it out of the envelope and showed it to reporters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on enforcement right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said, noting that the deals would be written and set for the signed agreement in November. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe think that China wants it badly and we want it also,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Trump said that the deal might signal a future \u00e2\u0080\u009clove fest\u00e2\u0080\u009d with China and\u00c2\u00a0the Vice Premier said that the deal would bring \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeace and prosperity to the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beyond a trade deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said.",

      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": " The remark came after Buttigieg, who is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was asked about whether bullying that causes suicide should have legal ramifications. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the things that could help,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Buttigieg said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are still states \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I live in one of them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have hate crime legislation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we need to make sure that our legislation reflects our values as a country and the insistence that nobody be singled out or harmed because of who they are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Buttigieg said. He continued: But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the beginning of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to do for LGBTQ youth. We know that LGBTQ youth are much more likely to experience homelessness, which is one of the reasons why we need to invest more in youth homelessness in general and do the opposite of what this president is doing, which is allowing rules to go forward that would actually make it harder for transgender youth to access homeless services. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is just wrong, and it will end in my administration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Buttigieg said. In fact, while the HUD rule \u00e2\u0080\u0094 posted in spring 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 does allow for shelters to make decisions based on privacy and safety, it specifically states that discrimination based on \u00e2\u0080\u009csexual orientation and gender identity\u00e2\u0080\u009d will not take place: This proposed rule provides that grant recipients, subrecipients, owners, operators, managers, and providers (Shelter Providers) under HUD programs which permit single-sex or sex-segregated facilities (such as bathrooms or temporary, emergency shelters and other buildings and facilities with physical limitations or configurations that require and are permitted to have shared sleeping quarters or bathing facilities) may establish a policy, consistent with state and local law, by which such Shelter Provider considers an individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sex for the purposes of determining accommodation within such shelters and for purposes of determining sex for admission to any facility or portion thereof. The proposed rule permits Shelter Providers to consider a range of factors in making such determinations, including privacy, safety, practical concerns, religious beliefs, any relevant considerations under civil rights and nondiscrimination authorities , the individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sex as reflected in official government documents, as well as the gender which a person identifies with. The proposed rule does not dictate a required basis for making determinations other than that they be consistent with an overall policy. The proposed rule continues HUD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy of ensuring that its programs are open to all eligible individuals and families regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Buttigieg joined eight other Democrat candidates at the marathon town hall, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), as well as former HUD Secretary Julian Castro (D), former Vice President Joe Biden (D), former Rep.

But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really hard, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think sometimes that older generations understand how much we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking this into account,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added: ",

      "content": " \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen Turkey notified us of an imminent military operation, we relocated a small contingent of less than 50 special operations soldiers out of the immediate zone of attack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis decision was made to ensure that American troops were not caught up in the fighting between Turkish and Kurdish forces.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe safety of our men and women in uniform remains our top priority,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Esper said Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision put the U.S. in a tough situation, given that Turkey is a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally. He said: The impulsive action of President Erdogan to invade northern Syria has put the United States in a tough situation, given our relationship with our NATO ally Turkey, who has fought alongside the United States in the past, and the Syrian Democratic Forces who helped us destroy the physical caliphate of ISIS, and the safety of U.S. military personnel. He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRather than get pulled into this conflict, we put the safety of our soldiers first, while urging Turkey to forego its operations and working hard with us to address their concerns through the development of a security zone along the border.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to take U.S. troops out of a pending military clash, critics have attacked the administration for \u00e2\u0080\u009cabandoning\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Syrian Kurds, who the U.S. armed to defeat the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria. Critics have accused the Trump administration of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreen-lighting\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Turkish incursion into northern Syria, where the Kurds had staked out a semi-autonomous region during the Syrian civil war. The Turks, who consider the Syrian Kurds to be terrorists and an existential threat, have long wanted to move against them in Syria. Esper said the U.S. had tried to prevent any pending attack, but that ultimately Turkey decided to make a move. He and other senior national security officials have adamantly denied that the administration gave Turkey the green light. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe oppose and are greatly disappointed by Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to launch a unilateral, military incursion into northern Syria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis operation puts our SDF partners in harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way, it risks the security of ISIS prison camps, and will further destabilize the region.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the president on down, we have communicated with the Turks on this issue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI spoke with Turkish Defense Minister Akar yesterday to express our strong opposition to Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions, and reiterated the damage this is doing to our bilateral relationship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also said the U.S. was not abandoning the Syrian Kurds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be clear, we are not abandoning our Kurdish partner forces and U.S. troops remain with them in other parts of Syria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe remain in close coordination with the Syrian Democratic Forces who helped us destroy the physical caliphate of ISIS, but I will not place American service members in the middle of a longstanding conflict between the Turks and the Kurds. This is not why we are in Syria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will continue to work with members of the defeat ISIS coalition and the Syrian Democratic Forces to ensure the defeat of ISIS,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. In addition, he said the Syrian Defense Forces have transferred two ISIS terrorists to U.S. custody who were involved in the kidnapping and murder of U.S. and U.K. citizens in Syria. He said they were being held in a safe and secure location in the U.S., but outside of Syria. Follow Breitbart News\u00e2\u0080\u0099s @Kristina_Wong.",

      "subtitle": "Some House Democrats are privately calling on Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to hold a vote to formalize the impeachment inquiry to undermine Republican criticism that the process is illegitimate, Politico reported this week.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " So far, Pelosi has refused to schedule a vote, arguing that the Constitution and House rules do not require the lawmakers to do so. Meanwhile, the White House and its Republican congressional allies contend that such a vote is necessary to legitimize the inquiry per the recognized standards of previous impeachment efforts. Politico reported: Some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, to a lesser extent, publicly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Though a small but growing chorus of Democrats has started urging a vote simply to undercut this GOP talking point, others say that nothing will stop Trump and his supporters from claiming Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts are unfair and inconsistent with past impeachment procedures. They say the party shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bait, arguing that the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defenders will simply find other reasons to not comply with the inquiry. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cprivate\u00e2\u0080\u009d debate on whether or not to hold a vote \u00e2\u0080\u009cis threatening to cleave Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unified front\u00e2\u0080\u009d in favor of impeachment, the news outlet added. Rep. John Yarmuth (D-KY) publicly called for a vote, telling Politico,\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Nancy asked me, I would say sure, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have a vote. Everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on record, so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to vote any differently. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the danger in having a vote to formalize it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d House lawmakers voted to allow an investigation into whether to impeach President Bill Clinton and President Richard Nixon. Republicans have pointed to those votes as evidence that Democrats are acting in an unfair and illegitimate manner. Politico noted: Democrats have long argued that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need a vote to launch formal impeachment proceedings, even if that had been the practice in prior presidential impeachment processes. In fact, House lawyers backed by Pelosi have made that argument in a succession of court cases seeking evidence to support their impeachment inquiry, and proponents of that position worry a formal vote would undercut their legal claims. Similarly, Democrats are worried that a near-term floor vote would drive away a handful of Republicans who are wavering over whether to support impeachment proceedings. A party-line vote would hand the White House another talking point, they argue: that impeachment is a purely partisan effort by Democrats. In a letter to Pelosi and the House chairmen pursuing the impeachment inquiry, the White House said the Democrats were conducting a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconstitutionally invalid\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cillegitimate\u00e2\u0080\u009d impeachment probe that absolves lawmakers of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctaking political accountability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The White House said it would not cooperate with the ongoing \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartisan\u00e2\u0080\u009d impeachment investigation. Although the letter stopped short of explicitly calling on Pelosi to hold a vote, it all but dared the Speaker to do so. Most of the 235 members of the House Democratic Caucus support the impeachment probe, but there are still eight who did not, as of Thursday afternoon, a tally from the New York Times revealed.",

      "author": "Michael Patrick Leahy",
      "content": " The primary pits incumbent Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards against Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-LA) and Republican businessman Eddie Rispone. Edwards has been hovering in recent polls just a few points under the 50 percent majority he will need to avoid a November runoff election against Saturday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second place finisher. Abraham and Rispone have been jockeying for the second spot, with both registering between 20 percent and 25 percent in recent polls. President Trump has been attacking Edwards vigorously in recent days, portraying him as another Democrat in lockstep with the impeachment inquiry announced two weeks ago by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). On Tuesday, White House Counsel Pat Cippolone sent a powerful letter to Pelosi, calling the inquiry an illegal and unconstitutional violation of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s due process rights. For his part, Edwards has attempted to deflect the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attacks while avoiding a direct confrontation, as The Advocate reported on Friday: Hours before President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planned rally in Lake Charles Friday, Gov. John Bel Edwards said voters should not take cues from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartisanship\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Washington, D.C., and touted his working relationship with the president on the eve of the open primary election in the governor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s race. Edwards, the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, responded to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter missives against him, noting he has long held a pro-gun stance and saying Trump doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know him or Louisiana. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think Louisiana should be taking its inspiration from the partisanship of D.C.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in a half-hour-long press conference at SOWELA Community Technical College in Lake Charles. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Washington, instead, should take inspiration from the bipartisanship of Louisiana.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Washington Post noted that Edwards\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to avoid a runoff may fall short: As the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, John Bel Edwards appeared to be doing everything necessary to win a second term in Louisiana, a state whose populist Democratic roots seem to fray a bit more each year. Edwards signed some of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most restrictive abortion laws . He cozied up to President Trump, scoring an invite to a state dinner at the White House. And in a state with a robust Catholic population, Edwards aired television ads showing him shaking hands with Pope Francis. But all that still might not be enough for the governor to win his reelection battle outright on Saturday, as Trump holds an 11th-hour rally to boost support for the two leading GOP challengers. Early voting results suggest that the impeachment inquiry has created massive increases in Republican and Independent turnout, as Breitbart News reported\u00c2\u00a0on Sunday: Early voting in the October 12 \u00e2\u0080\u009cjungle primary\u00e2\u0080\u009d between incumbent Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and two Republican candidates ended on Saturday, and the turnout is massive, particularly among Republicans and Independents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs of last night, 374,190 Louisianians either early voted by person or by mail in ballot (340,480 in person, and 33,710 mail in ballots). To put this number in perspective, this is the highest early voting turnout EVER for a non-Presidential election, and is the second highest early voting turnout EVER (only the 2016 Presidential election has seen a higher in person + absentee voting turnout with 531,555 early votes),\u00e2\u0080\u009d Louisiana-based JMC Analytics reported on Sunday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRepublican turnout volume is up 84%, while Independent turnout is up 80% and Democratic turnout is up 36%,\u00e2\u0080\u009d JMC Analytics concluded. On election eve, the question of whether Edwards will surpass the 50 percent margin needed to avoid a runoff remains in doubt. The outcome is likely to be determined by Republican turnout on election day. Historically, about 80 percent of all votes in the gubernatorial jungle primary are cast on election day. Should Edwards fail to reach 50 percent, Republicans are expected to rally around the second place finisher in the November runoff, whether it be Abraham or Rispone. That possible Republican consolidation in a potential November runoff election may be easier for Abraham than Rispone, since Abraham has focused his campaign attacks on Edwards, while Rispone has criticized both Edwards and Abraham.",

In a New York Times report last month, McAleenan was accused of telling federal immigration officials to ignore Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders at the U.S.-Mexico border. McAleenan, in June, was accused of having leaked raids scheduled by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency in order to sabotage and stop the plan.

      "content": " Smith announced during Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edition of his weekday program\u00c2\u00a0Shepard Smith Reporting that today would be his final broadcast at the network. Smith, known for his critical coverage of President Donald\u00c2\u00a0Trump, said in a statement: Recently I asked the company to allow me to leave FOX News and begin a new chapter. After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged. The opportunities afforded this guy from small town Mississippi have been many. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked with the most talented, dedicated and focused professionals I know and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud to have anchored their work each day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I will deeply miss them. According to CNN, staffers inside Fox News were \u00e2\u0080\u009copenly weeping\u00e2\u0080\u009d over the news of Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure and said some \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere here and have stayed here solely\u00e2\u0080\u009d due to the anchor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be surprised if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an exodus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the staffer continued, before adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFox hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just lost Shep today.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Smith joined\u00c2\u00a0Fox News in 1996 and covered major news stories for the network for over two decades. In a statement,\u00c2\u00a0Fox News president and executive editor, Jay Wallace, said Smith will leave his post as chief news anchor and managing editor of the outlet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breaking news unit. Wallace said in a statement: Shep is one of the premier newscasters of his generation and his extraordinary body of work is among the finest journalism in the industry. His integrity and outstanding reporting from the field helped put FOX News on the map and there is simply no better breaking news anchor who has the ability to transport a viewer to a place of conflict, tragedy, despair or elation through his masterful delivery. We are proud of the signature reporting and anchoring style he honed at FOX News, along with everything he accomplished here during his monumental 23-year tenure. While this day is especially difficult as his former producer, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network. Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure comes as President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with Fox News continues to deteriorate. On Thursday, the president knocked Smith in a pair of tweets that were critical of a Fox News poll that found a record 51 percent of voters support his impeachment and removal from office. The president\u00c2\u00a0tweeted: Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Speaking to reporters ahead of his rally in Louisiana, President Trump questioned whether Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exit from Fox News was prompted by his ratings. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m assuming he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaving because of bad ratings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the president said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish him well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled, 2-1, that the Ohio law violated the Supreme Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, specifically by disregarding whether the fetus is viable at the time of the abortion. In the majority opinion, Judges Bernice Bouie Donald, an Obama appointee, and R. Guy Cole, a Clinton appointee, affirmed the lower court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruling and noted the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument that the decision in Roe v. Wade \u00e2\u0080\u009cexpressly rejected the claim that the right to abortion is \u00e2\u0080\u0098absolute\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and therefore entitles a woman to obtain an abortion \u00e2\u0080\u0098for whatever reasons she alone chooses.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d The state said the intention of Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law was to prevent discrimination against children with a disability; hence, its name is the Antidiscrimination Law. The judges said, however, that 20 years later in Planned Parenthood v. Casey\u00c2\u00a0the Supreme Court upheld Roe, affirming that \u00e2\u0080\u009c[t]he woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to terminate her pregnancy before viability is the most central principle of Roe v. Wade.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the judges said. Senior Judge Alice Batchelder, a George H.W. Bush appointee, dissented, however. She affirmed the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in fighting discrimination against those with disabilities. Batchelder also cited Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 statement that an abortion law in Indiana \u00e2\u0080\u009cand other laws like it promote a State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Batchelder continued: Ohio enacted the Antidiscrimination Law, H.B. 214, to counteract such eugenicist practices concerning the prenatal Down Syndrome population. The law prevents a physician from performing an abortion when the physician knows the abortion is sought not because the woman did not intend to become pregnant, but because the child in the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s womb tested positive for Down Syndrome. In 2017, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) signed the bill into law that prohibited abortion in the case of unborn babies with Down syndrome.

Trump said: On issue after issue, Democrats have put the needs of foreign citizens ahead of our own citizens. We protect borders of other countries, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t protect our own borders.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has promised to provide free, taxpayer-funded healthcare to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens, a program that would cost anywhere between $23 to $66 billion every year. Trump said\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then you wonder why they come to America. Why wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they come? Free healthcare, free education, free everything \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the Democrat vision of America is to rob American taxpayers to fund socialism for the entire world. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want Democrats to raid your healthcare, steal your money, overcrowd your schools, and overwhelm your communities, then you have only one choice, you have to go out tomorrow, vote Republican. Get John Bel Edwards the hell out of office. As Breitbart News has reported, Trump has negotiated deals with Mexico to increase border controls on the Mexican side of the border to stop illegal aliens from crossing into the U.S. The most notable is Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cRemain in Mexico\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy that ends the process by which border crossers are released into the interior of the country and instead returned to Mexico, preventing mass asylum fraud.

      "content": " During a rally in Lake Charles, Louisiana on Friday evening, Trump said Democrats support voter fraud and oppose voter ID laws because \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey cheat like hell\u00e2\u0080\u009d in national elections by getting non-citizens to vote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe radical Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 assault on American freedom and American citizenship will now end,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDemocrats also continue to encourage foreign interference in our elections by refusing to support a simple and beautiful thing called voter ID.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you want to go out and buy groceries, you need identification \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the only thing you [don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t] need identification is to vote \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the most important single thing you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know why, because they cheat like hell, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. In contrast, Trump said only American citizens must be allowed to vote in elections and that this should be supported through national voter ID laws that protect the integrity of American citizens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 votes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe believe only American citizens should vote in American elections and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou go out to California and you see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a disgrace. The voter abuse, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a disgrace what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in California.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump went on to say: In everything I do, I never forget that I am not president of the world, I am president of the United States of America. We reject globalism and we embrace patriotism. We believe that every American citizen, no matter their background, deserves a government that is loyal to them. The Democrat Party and the radical Left are trying to abolish the distinction between citizens and non-citizens. In many cases, people that come into our country illegally \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 they were treated better than our Vets \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 not anymore. As Breitbart News has reported, voter fraud is widespread across states like California, Texas, and Florida, according to experts. In Texas, for example, there are roughly 95,000 noncitizens on the voter rolls. Likewise, in California, expert Eric Eggers has detailed how the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enormous illegal alien population is likely being facilitated to vote through the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ballot harvesting policy.

On Wednesday, Breitbart News reported that 2020 presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden accused\u00c2\u00a0Trump of obstructing justice and violating his oath of office. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, to preserve our constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden said, \u00e2\u0080\u009che should be impeached. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not only because of what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done.

He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we can not let him get away with it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden concluded. However, President Trump defended himself against the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 calls for impeachment on Wednesday by tweeting that he did nothing wrong: Only 25 percent want the President Impeached, which is pretty low considering the volume of Fake News coverage, but pretty high considering the fact that I did NOTHING wrong. It is all just a continuation of the greatest Scam and Witch Hunt in the history of our Country! \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019  On Thursday, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) echoed the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statements by saying that Democrats were using impeachment as a political campaign: This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t impeachment. This is a political campaign. Democrats know they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win a REAL campaign, so they are:\n-Abusing House procedures\n-Selectively leaking information\n-Hiding the truth from the American people They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just making the rules up as they go along. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 10, 2019  On Wednesday, Jordan wrote on Twitter that Democrats were \u00e2\u0080\u009cso busy \u00e2\u0080\u0098striking while the iron is hot\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have a vote to start their crazy impeachment proceedings!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOr maybe they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to go on record for the American people.
