Both men were born in former Soviet republics.\u00c2\u00a0Mr. Giuliani, President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private lawyer, identified the two men in May as his clients. Both men have donated to Republican campaigns including Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and in May 2018 gave $325,000 to the primary pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00c2\u00a0A Justice Department official said [Attorney General\u00c2\u00a0William Barr] was supportive of their work on the case, on which he was first briefed shortly after being confirmed as attorney general in February.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFox poll: Record support for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ouster -\u00c2\u00a0Fox News:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust over half of voters want\u00c2\u00a0President Trump\u00c2\u00a0impeached and removed from office, according to a Fox News Poll released Wednesday. A new high of 51 percent wants Trump impeached and removed from office, another 4 percent want him impeached but not removed, and 40 percent oppose impeachment altogether. In July, 42 percent favored impeachment and removal, while 5 percent said impeach but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remove him, and 45 percent opposed impeachment.Since July, support for impeachment increased among voters of all stripes: up 11 points among Democrats, 5 points among Republicans and 3 among independents. Support also went up among some of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s key constituencies, including white evangelical Christians (+5 points), white men without a college degree (+8), and rural whites (+10).\u00c2\u00a0Among voters in swing counties (where\u00c2\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00c2\u00a0and Trump were within 10 points in 2016), support for impeachment increased to 52 percent, up from 42 percent in July.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPence to release transcripts of his Ukraine calls -\u00c2\u00a0AP:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cVice President\u00c2\u00a0Mike Pence\u00c2\u00a0said Wednesday he is working with the White House counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office to release transcripts of his own calls with Ukranian President\u00c2\u00a0Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Pence said records of his two phone conversations would help exonerate President Donald Trump of any wrongdoing. Pence was asked about releasing his transcripts and told reporters, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have no objection to that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He spoke after an event in Waukee, Iowa, where he addressed supporters about the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade policy. Pence said he \u00e2\u0080\u0098never discussed the issue of the Bidens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 with Zelenskiy. And he again defended the president, insisting that a \u00e2\u0080\u0098plain reading\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the rough transcript of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with the Ukranian leader shows \u00e2\u0080\u0098there was no quid pro quo.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPergram: Trump team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stonewalling speeds up Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 timetable -\u00c2\u00a0Fox News:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNext Tuesday is the deadline for most of the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requests. That coincides with the day the House returns to session. [Nancy]\u00c2\u00a0Pelosi\u00c2\u00a0will take the temperature of her caucus when lawmakers return. But in some respects, Pelosi already knows the temperature. Democrats are seething over the administration failing to meet congressional demands. They think they have a robust case against the president when it comes to obstruction of Congress. Pelosi could grant the administration more time to comply. That would let the issue marinate in public for a bit \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and demonstrate that Democrats aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hasty to impeach. But after that, the House Judiciary Committee could begin drafting articles of impeachment. Pelosi doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t travel roads like this unless she already knows the outcome. She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lose votes on the floor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially something of this magnitude.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTrump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Syria decision affects GOP backing on impeachment -\u00c2\u00a0WaPo:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to suddenly withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria has angered evangelical Christian leaders and Republican hawks, cleaving his political coalition at the very moment he is trying to fortify his standing to survive the intensifying impeachment inquiry in Congress. Instead of enjoying uncontested GOP support as he plunges into a constitutional showdown with House Democrats and prepares for a bruising reelection campaign, Trump is now fighting on two fronts within his party. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The past few days have tested the bounds of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican support at an unusually frenzied political crossroads that has brought uncertainty for elected officials. While GOP lawmakers have been skittish about directly engaging the subject at the heart of the impeachment debate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct with his Ukrainian counterpart \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many have felt free to loudly condemn Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Syria decision, underscoring the fluidity within GOP ranks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Judge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ruling: With Syria, Trump lives up to his campaign promise -\u00c2\u00a0This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge\u00c2\u00a0Andrew Napolitano\u00c2\u00a0explains that President Trump removing U.S. troops from Syria complies with his duty to uphold the Constitution: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump ran for office promising to bring the troops home. He may have made the latest decision to do so without adequate warning to his military commanders, but his decision is utterly consistent with his promises, and it is utterly in compliance with the Constitution. Now is the time for Congress -- which is largely angry at the presidential use or nonuse of the military -- to repeal both AUMFs and the War Powers Resolution and reclaim its constitutional power as the sole entity in the federal government able to declare war. Until it does, these profoundly outdated, morally ambivalent and overtly unconstitutional statutes lie in the presidential desk drawer like a loaded gun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d More\u00c2\u00a0here.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: CUE \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099M JUST A BILL\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe President of the United States is to have power to return a bill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature, for reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law, if, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both houses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00c2\u00a0Federalist No. 69\n\nTIME OUT: \u00e2\u0080\u0098WHY YOU SHOULD BE EATING MORE CHEDDAR\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nWSJ: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor over 150 years\u00c2\u00a0cheddar was the most popular cheese in the U.S. It sustained colonists and Civil War soldiers, and was the foundation for the industrial innovation of processed \u00e2\u0080\u0098American\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cheese. Only recently was cheddar demoted to second place in overall consumption, usurped by that ubiquitous pizza-topper, mozzarella. Though English in origin, cheddar has been part of the American experience from the very start, and today some of this country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best cheese makers are turning out better cheddar than ever before.\u00c2\u00a0Cheddaring, the stacking of blocks of drained curds to extract more whey, creates a sturdy curd suited to aging. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Commodity cheddar is a publicly traded product whose destiny is frozen food, pre-shredded packs and economy supermarket wedges; specialty cheddar, made on a small scale and sold primarily at cheese counters and gourmet stores, is often preserved in wax or clothbound (wrapped in cotton cloth and rubbed with oil or lard).\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFlag on the play? -\u00c2\u00a0Email us at\u00c2\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00c2\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\nBiden:\u00c2\u00a027.4 points (\u00e2\u0086\u0091\u00c2\u00a00.6 points from last wk.)\nWarren:\u00c2\u00a025 points (\u00e2\u0086\u0091 2.2 points from last wk.)\nSanders:\u00c2\u00a014.6 points (\u00e2\u0086\u0093\u00c2\u00a01.4 points\u00c2\u00a0from last wk.)\nButtigieg:\u00c2\u00a05.6 points (\u00e2\u0086\u0093\u00c2\u00a00.4 points from last wk.)\nHarris:\u00c2\u00a04.6 points (\u00e2\u0086\u0093\u00c2\u00a01 point\u00c2\u00a0from last wk.)\n\n[Averages include: Quinnipiac University, IBD, Monmouth University, Fox News and NBC News/WSJ.]\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00c2\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00c2\u00a042.4 percent\nAverage disapproval:\u00c2\u00a053.8 percent\nNet Score:\u00c2\u00a0-11.4 percent\nChange from one week ago:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0086\u0093 0.4 points\n\n[Average includes: Fox News: 43% approve - 55% disapprove; NBC/WSJ: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 40% approve - 54% disapprove; IBD: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; Monmouth University: 43% approve - 53% disapprove.]\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\u00c2\u00a0\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

It came after days of privately huddling with advisers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSanders retracts statement about slowing down campaign -\u00c2\u00a0NBC News: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSen.\u00c2\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00c2\u00a0on Wednesday tamped down speculation that he would slow his presidential campaign after he suffered a heart attack last week, saying he plans to compete as vigorously as ever for the 2020 Democratic nomination. The Vermont independent told NBC in an exclusive interview airing Wednesday night on \u00e2\u0080\u0098Nightly News\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and Thursday on the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099 show that his health scare has only strengthened his resolve, despite telling reporters a day earlier he planned to curtail his normally packed schedule. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Sanders said during the interview alongside his wife,\u00c2\u00a0Jane Sanders. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He added, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWarren refreshes vow against high-dollar fundraisers -\u00c2\u00a0Politico:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSen. Elizabeth Warren said she will continue to swear off high-dollar campaign fundraisers in the general election if she becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, extending her self-imposed ban on the events beyond the primary and reversing an earlier statement. \u00e2\u0080\u0098When Elizabeth is the Democratic nominee for president, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 campaign spokeswoman\u00c2\u00a0Kristen Orthman\u00c2\u00a0said in a statement Tuesday, which Warren later amplified in a Twitter thread. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That broad statement worried some Democrats, as the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential nominee traditionally has been a big fundraiser for other candidates and Democratic committees. But in a Wednesday statement, Orthman clarified that Warren's pledge would apply only to her presidential campaign, not to raising money for the Democratic Party or other candidates.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTEAM TRUMP GOING ALL OUT FOR MINNESOTA, YOU BETCHA\nNYT:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cA Republican presidential candidate has not won the state of Minnesota since\u00c2\u00a0Richard M. Nixon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s victory there in 1972. But President Trump has long viewed it as the one that got away. Mr. Trump barely set foot in the state during his 2016 campaign, and his field organization on the ground was nonexistent\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This time, the Trump campaign is determined not to let Minnesota go without trying. So on Thursday night, Mr. Trump will arrive in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic congressional districts in the country, for his first political rally since House Democrats began an impeachment investigation that threatens to engulf his presidency. It is a rare rally for Mr. Trump in a state he did not win in 2016, and takes him to the heart of opposition territory\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Meanwhile,\u00c2\u00a0Brad Parscale, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, is planning to pour tens of millions of dollars into the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Minnesota operation, compared with the $30,000 the Trump campaign spent on the state last cycle. The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLOUISIANA GOVERNOR RACE HEATS UP IN CLOSING DAYS\nPolitico:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe last televised primary debate in Louisiana saw Republicans\u00c2\u00a0Ralph Abraham\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Eddie Rispone\u00c2\u00a0go after [Democratic Gov.\u00c2\u00a0John Bel]\u00c2\u00a0Edwards\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 but also each other, as they seek a second-place finish in an uncertain runoff. Rispone took the opportunity to post a question to Abraham, asking why he promised to donate his congressional salary but later stopped doing so, while Abraham criticized Rispone for his past support of Common Core. The two also argued back and forth about each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s records, with Abraham accusing Rispone of running \u00e2\u0080\u0098distasteful\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attack ads, and Rispone calling Abraham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s line of attack on Common Core \u00e2\u0080\u0098an outright lie.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The pair of Republicans did train their fire on Edwards, too. They hit him over the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy and needled him on why he backed\u00c2\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00c2\u00a0in 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an attempt to nationalize the race, with President Donald Trump, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been tweeting proflicially about the race, planning an election-eve visit to Lake Charles on Friday night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMcGrath raises $10.7 million in campaign to oust McConnell - WashTimes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDemocrat\u00c2\u00a0Amy McGrath\u00c2\u00a0raised a record $10.7 million in the last three months for her bit to topple Senate Majority Leader\u00c2\u00a0Mitch McConnell\u00c2\u00a0in the Senate race in Kentucky. Ms. McGrath, a Marine fighter pilot, is the leading Democratic candidate in the race to take on Mr. McConnell, a six-term senator who is immensely unpopular in his home state. The $10.7 million that Ms. McGrath raised in the third quarter came from 299,000 donors with an average individual contribution of $36. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mitch McConnell has never faced an opponent like Amy McGrath. Not only does a new independent poll show the race tied, but more than a quarter-million grassroots donations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from all 120 Kentucky counties \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have provided us a record-shattering first quarter of nearly $11 million to take down McConnell and his self-serving special interest allies.

Woah, woah, woah! Can we please get an emergency podcast to discuss the new Fox News poll that has 51% of Americans supporting impeachment and removal? This seems crazy, yet not entirely surprising!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Katie Hacker, Evington, Va.\n\n\n[Ed. note: I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if we can manage that one, Ms. Hacker, but how about a little Bleacher banter? It may be best here to look at our excellent pollsters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 work in context. If you check out FiveThirtyEight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0very helpful averages\u00c2\u00a0on the subject, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see that support for impeachment has been on a sharp increase. On the day when the news broke that the President Trump had sought help from the Ukrainian president in getting dirt on the Bidens, opposition to impeachment ran 11 points ahead, 51 percent to 40 percent. That was in mid-September. Today, the average stands at 49 percent in favor of impeachment and 43 percent opposed. Support among Democrats and independents has jumped 10 points or more while Republicans increased a more modest, but still significant, 4 points on average. The takeaway from our poll and every other credible pollster is that the tide has turned decisively against the president. There is still a long way to go here and public opinion on this subject is obviously malleable. But if more than 80 percent of Democrats are already on board, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to see that number declining much any time soon. That means Team Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s urgent work is to convince increasingly skeptical independent voters that the president deserves to remain in office. It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be enough to count on the anger of core Republican supporters.]\u00c2\u00a0\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI've been following your continued response to readers who stubbornly insist on asking for a crime worthy of impeachment. Your response is that it's not a legal issue but a political issue. As a devotee of the U.S. Constitution, I really think that your reading of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098high crimes and misdemeanors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 standard should actually read \u00e2\u0080\u0098high crimes, misdemeanors, and anything else the U.S. House of Representatives feels adequate to the occasion\u00e2\u0080\u0099 would be more of a support for your position. But, alas, such language seems to be missing. Or am I reading the wrong U.S. Constitution?\u00c2\u00a0 Please advise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Bill Panagakos, Littleton, Colo.\n\n\n[Ed. note: It may be helpful here to look at the intent of the Framers in devising the vehicle. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00c2\u00a0Alexander Hamilton\u00c2\u00a0wrote in Federalist No. 65 about the purpose of impeachment:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u00e2\u0080\u009d was a term of art long before the Constitution was drafted. As Hamilton alludes to in the passage above, the \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the term refers to the office more so than the offenses. The purpose of impeachment isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to prosecute federal officials for crimes, but rather to remove them from office for abusing their powers and breaching the public trust. The Framers were following in the footsteps of British politician and political philosopher,\u00c2\u00a0Edmund Burke. In his famous speech in 1786 seeking the impeachment of the governor general of India,\u00c2\u00a0Warren Hastings, for self-seeking, tyrannical treatment of the crown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Indian subjects Burke declared\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe principles of honor, the spirit of cavaliers to govern here; not the low principles of jurisprudence only.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0Hastings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 scandal and trial were very much on the minds of Americans during the drafting and ratification of the Constitution and Burke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that \u00e2\u0080\u009cprinciples of honor\u00e2\u0080\u009d were essential to consider \u00e2\u0080\u0093 was the mainstream opinion on this side of the Atlantic. This is why the Senate, not the Supreme Court or some bicameral commission, was chosen to sit in judgment. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hamilton again: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sound familiar? The Senate, then indirectly elected by state legislatures, with its members serving six year terms, was seen as the best home for dispassionate, fair-minded evaluations of the facts at hand without the unpleasant thought of unelected judges removing an elected president. The House, more easily incited to partisan passion and more responsive to the immediate will of the electorate, can prosecute, but the upper chamber runs the show. Whether or not you agree with their assessment, if a majority of the members of the House believe that the president has abused his office for personal gain and should be removed, they would be entirely within the American understanding of an impeachable offense. Just as it would be within that tradition for the Senate to reject their claim if its members so choose. This is how the system is supposed to work. I imagine that Democrats will end up correlating their articles with existing criminal offenses, like the solicitation of campaign help from foreign countries and obstruction, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just window dressing. Appeals to honor and ethics are enough.]\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRe: your report on\u00c2\u00a0Trey Gowdy\u00c2\u00a0joining Team Trump.

Gowdy is arguably the best suited man in America to go up against House Democrats in this matter. He has a strong reputation among Republicans but still enjoys some credibility among his former Democratic colleagues for his successful navigation of efforts by Trump loyalists to torch the FBI.

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only really had standard practices for the past century or so. Certainly back in 1787, it was highly irregular across the English-speaking world. If you look at our founding documents you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see that in those days, for example, it was conventional to capitalize nouns in the way modern German speakers do. Consider the American creed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As you can see, the capitalization of nouns isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even standard. Why \u00e2\u0080\u009cRights\u00e2\u0080\u009d but not \u00e2\u0080\u009cmen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cLiberty\u00e2\u0080\u009d but not \u00e2\u0080\u009ctruths?\u00e2\u0080\u009d What comes through is that capitalization was a form of emphasis, not grammatical rules. The capitalized words after the start of the sentence \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009cCreator,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cRights,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cLife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cLiberty\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cHappiness\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 actually make for a kind of semaphore for the actual meaning of the sentence. The essence is there in those five key words. So yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry to break it to you that ALL CAPS was a thing before Twitter.

      "author": "Ronn Blitzer",
      "content": " Newly declassified court documents indicate that the\u00c2\u00a0FBI failed to comply with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in targeting Americans while searching through NSA records\u00c2\u00a0during President Trump's administration and after James Comey's tenure as FBI director. An October 2018 ruling\u00c2\u00a0from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) found\u00c2\u00a0that the FBI violated Section 702 by not keeping track of searches that pertained to \"United States persons,\" and that proposed changes were still not enough to comply with the law.\u00c2\u00a0That ruling was later affirmed on appeal in July 2019. The documents were declassified and released Tuesday. FISA Section 702, which deals with targeting people outside the U.S. for gathering foreign intelligence information, places restrictions on gathering information when it comes to Americans or people located in the U.S. LINDSEY GRAHAM WARNS FISA ABUSE WILL HAPPEN AGAIN 'IF SOMEBODY'S NOT PUNISHED HERE' \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause the FBI's proposed procedures do not require it to keep records that \u00e2\u0080\u0098indicate whether terms are United States person query terms,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the FISC held that these procedures do not comply with Section 702(f)(l)(B),\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the decision from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISC-R), which heard the appeal. The queries examined took place between\u00c2\u00a02017 and 2018, which would largely be during FBI director Chris Wray's tenure and during the Trump presidency. The FBI did not immediately return a request for comment. The FBI has argued that because they kept general records of the search terms used\u00c2\u00a0that was enough to satisfy Section 702\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requirement of keeping search records, but the court found that because they did not specify which queries were related to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnited States person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it did not satisfy the law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requirement. For context, the FISC ruling noted that in 2017, the FBI ran \"approximately 3.1 million queries against raw FISA-acquired information, including section 702-acquired information.\" While the FBI's failure to specify which ones pertained to U.S. persons, making it difficult to determine how many searches were affected by their insufficient practices, Judge James Boasberg\u00c2\u00a0noted that \"given the FBI's domestic focus it seems likely that a significant percentage of its queries involve U.S.-person query terms.\" Boasberg's ruling also ordered the government to keep written records of each instance where the FBI reviews information \u00e2\u0080\u009cconcerning a United States person\u00e2\u0080\u009d obtained through Section 702, where the query was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot designed to find and extract foreign-intelligence information.\" These records shall include details of the information, how it is meant to be used, and the search terms used to get the information. After the July 2019 FISC-R decision, the FBI submitted new proposed procedures that the court deemed acceptable in a September ruling. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The newly released decisions came after FISC Judge Rosemary Collyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2017 ruling, which found that officials under the Obama administration used FISA to conduct illegal surveillance of American citizens for years. A soon-to-be-released report from the Justice Department Inspector General will explore whether the FBI conducted a different sort of FISA abuse in connection with former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. During the early stages of the investigation of Russian interference with the 2016 election, the FBI obtained a warrant to monitor Page, which Republicans claim was based on a misrepresentation of evidence in the form of an unverified dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele as opposition research for Democrats and the Clinton campaign.",

The arraignment and detention hearing for Henry Kyle Frese has been set for Friday at 11 a.m. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Frese, 30, a counterterrorism analyst who held a top-secret clearance at the DIA, had started\u00c2\u00a0as a contractor in January 2017 before working at the agency\u00c2\u00a0full time. He faces two counts of willful transmission of national defense information to persons not entitled to receive it, charges that come with up to 10 years in prison each. DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY EMPLOYEE ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY LEAKING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO REPORTERS The prosecutor said he wanted to wait on a pretrial services report before holding an arraignment, which was originally scheduled for 2 p.m. Thursday. Between April and May 2018, Frese allegedly accessed classified intelligence reports \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some of which were unrelated to his job duties \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and leaked secret information regarding a foreign country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weapons system to a reporter, according to court documents. The documents accused Frese of being\u00c2\u00a0romantically involved with one of the reporters to whom he allegedly leaked information. A criminal indictment said a first reporter wrote at least eight articles from five compromised intelligence reports leaked by Frese. It said Frese re-tweeted a link to one of the articles that\u00c2\u00a0used the information he allegedly had provided. The first reporter then asked Frese if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be willing to speak to another reporter, according to the criminal indictment.

      "author": "Adam Shaw",
      "content": " In the span of just a few months, the idea of providing health care to illegal immigrants has morphed from a fringe, left-wing fancy to a\u00c2\u00a0plank of many 2020 Democrats' presidential campaigns\u00c2\u00a0-- but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a proposal that one study predicts\u00c2\u00a0would cost American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year. A standout moment\u00c2\u00a0of the June 27\u00c2\u00a0Democratic primary debate was that of all the candidates on the stage raising their hands, signifying support for\u00c2\u00a0government\u00c2\u00a0health care plans including \u00e2\u0080\u009cundocumented\u00e2\u0080\u009d immigrants. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SHOULD GET HEALTH CARE, SAY DEMS IN NIGHT 2 DEBATE Republicans and the White House have seized on that moment, with President Trump declaring it \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe end of the race.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But with the campaign\u00c2\u00a0definitely not over, and a number of frontrunners now backing the policy, more attention is turning to how much it could cost to give\u00c2\u00a0millions of illegal immigrants health insurance. On Thursday, the Center for Immigration Studies\u00c2\u00a0(CIS), a policy group that advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, published a study finding\u00c2\u00a0that the cost could be up to $23 billion a year. While candidates have not necessarily gone into detail\u00c2\u00a0about their plans, CIS cites an Atlantic survey that found that Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.;\u00c2\u00a0and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro would all provide \u00e2\u0080\u009cfull benefits\u00e2\u0080\u009d to those in the country illegally. The CIS study estimated that\u00c2\u00a04.9 million illegal immigrants have incomes below 400 percent of the poverty line and also do not have insurance -- meaning they have incomes low enough to receive coverage via either Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act -- also known to many, particularly critics, as ObamaCare. The study estimates that if all income-eligible, uninsured illegal immigrants received subsidies under the ACA, then the cost to insure would be $22.6 billion, but with \u00e2\u0080\u009clikely enrollment\u00e2\u0080\u009d of 46 percent, the total cost would be perhaps $10.4 billion a year. It predicts that the average cost of a subsidized premium would be $4,637. If a mixed approach of ACA subsidies and Medicaid enrollment were\u00c2\u00a0used, the cost would dip\u00c2\u00a0to $19.6 billion with 100 percent enrollment, and $10.7 billion assuming \u00e2\u0080\u009clikely enrollment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These numbers could change significantly if\u00c2\u00a0a more overarching\u00c2\u00a0health care overhaul is passed by a future Democratic White House and Congress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNumbers aside, the fact that presidential candidates are advocating spending billions of dollars on people who are in the country illegally is significant in its own right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the report concludes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt suggests that allowing in large numbers of less-educated workers will inevitably generate significant political pressure to provide them access to social programs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Extending health care to illegal immigrants could, however, be only one part of the cost to taxpayers of more generous social policies being pushed by Democrats. AOC PUSHES NATIONAL RENT CONTROL, WELFARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN LATEST MASSIVE PROPOSAL Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was an early champion of left-favored\u00c2\u00a0policies\u00c2\u00a0now finding their way into 2020 Democratic platforms, recently introduced a new package of policies known as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust Society.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Among those bills is \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Embrace Act,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as U.S. citizens and those in the country legally.

Page was monitored by the FBI pursuant to a\u00c2\u00a0Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant that was approved in October 2016 and renewed several times. Last month, Horowitz told lawmakers\u00c2\u00a0his team is nearly finished with its long-awaited review of alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and FBI,\u00c2\u00a0saying it has submitted a draft to Attorney General Bill Barr\u00c2\u00a0and is\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cfinalizing\u00e2\u0080\u009d the report ahead of its public release. NEWLY DECLASSIFIED DOCS REVEAL FISA ABUSES IN TARGETING AMERICANS The inspector general said his team has \u00e2\u0080\u009creviewed over 1\u00c2\u00a0million records and conducted over 100 interviews, including several of witnesses who only recently agreed to be interviewed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But RealClearInvestigations first reported that Page was not among those witnesses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have now begun the process of finalizing our report by providing a draft of our factual findings to the department and the FBI for classification determination and marking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Horowitz\u00c2\u00a0wrote in a letter to several House and Senate committees. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis step is consistent with our process for reports such as this one that involve classified material.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The FISA warrant applications targeting Page relied heavily on the now-discredited Steele dossier on Trump, which was funded by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign.\u00c2\u00a0The FBI formally documented the apparent anti-Trump bias of the dossier's author, British ex-spy\u00c2\u00a0Christopher Steele,\u00c2\u00a0shortly after the\u00c2\u00a0November 2016 presidential election --\u00c2\u00a0yet despite the red flags, continued to use his unverified\u00c2\u00a0dossier in the FISA applications,\u00c2\u00a0records\u00c2\u00a0obtained by Fox News earlier this year showed. WATCH: CARTER PAGE SAYS FBI INFORMANT 'INTENSIFIED' COMMS JUST BEFORE FISA WARRANT Meanwhile, a key FBI player during the time frame, former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, is facing the prospect of federal charges after Horowitz faulted him in a separate inquiry over\u00c2\u00a0statements he made during a Hillary Clinton-related investigation. The review found that McCabe \"lacked candor\" when talking with investigators, but the former FBI official has denied wrongdoing. Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu has recommended moving forward with charges against McCabe, a CNN contributor, though no indictment has been handed down. Horowitz's inquiry is not the only ongoing review at the DOJ. Barr has also assigned John Durham, the U.S. attorney for\u00c2\u00a0Connecticut, to conduct an inquiry into alleged misconduct and alleged improper government surveillance on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. Fox News reported this week that based on what he has been finding, Durham has expanded his investigation adding agents and resources, according to\u00c2\u00a0senior administration officials. The timeline has grown from the beginning of the probe through the election and now has included a post-election timeline through the spring of 2017, up to when Robert Mueller was named special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 elections. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And U.S. Attorney John Huber was appointed by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to review not only alleged surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and the FBI, but also their handling of the investigation into the Clinton Foundation and other matters.

      "content": " Two associates of Rudy Giuliani made their initial appearance before a federal judge on Thursday, less than 24 hours after they were arrested on campaign finance violations while trying to board an international flight with one-way tickets at Dulles International Airport outside of Washington D.C. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman appeared in\u00c2\u00a0federal court in Alexandria, Va. to face a four-count indictment alleging that they, along with two other co-defendants, conspired to violate a\u00c2\u00a0ban on foreign donations and contributions in connection with federal and state elections. The two men remained mostly silent during their appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Nachmanoff, who set their bond at $1 million each.\u00c2\u00a0Nachmanoff said\u00c2\u00a0he was reluctant to agree to a bond package but noted the mens' defense team and the government had agreed on it. Terms of bond included $1 million per suspect and\u00c2\u00a0the surrender of passports and all other travel documents, as well as travel restricted to the Southern District of Florida and Southern District of New York. They also will be subject to home detention and GPS monitoring, according to the agreement. Both Parnas and Fruman are expected to remain in custody for at least the remainder of the day, until the terms of the bond are met. \"You will be stuck here in limbo if the terms of the bond are not met,\"\u00c2\u00a0Nachmanoff said. GIULIANI ON TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: SALEM WITCH TRIALS 'FAIRER THAN THIS' The next\u00c2\u00a0hearing was scheduled for Oct. 17 in the Southern District of New York, where their indictments originated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cProtecting the integrity of our\u00c2\u00a0elections and protecting our\u00c2\u00a0elections from unlawful foreign\u00c2\u00a0influence are core functions of\u00c2\u00a0our campaign finance laws,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman\u00c2\u00a0said at a news conference Thursday. Berman added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs this office has made clear,\u00c2\u00a0we will not hesitate to\u00c2\u00a0investigate or prosecute those\u00c2\u00a0who engage in criminal conduct\u00c2\u00a0that draws into question the\u00c2\u00a0integrity of our political\u00c2\u00a0process, and I want to add that this\u00c2\u00a0investigation is continuing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parnas, 47, and Fruman, 53, created Global Energy Producers (GEP), and allegedly funneled money through the company. This included contributions of $325,000 and $15,000 to committees in May 2018, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto obtain access to exclusive political events and gain influence with politicians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the indictment says. They allegedly incorporated GEP around the time the contributions were made. According to Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, GEP contributed $325,000 in May 2018 to pro-Trump super PAC America\u00c2\u00a0First Action. In a statement, a\u00c2\u00a0spokesperson for America First Action noted that a complaint was filed with the FEC in July 2018 over this contribution, as well as separate litigation in Florida. The statement said\u00c2\u00a0that the money was placed \"in a segregated bank account,\" was not used, and \"will remain in this segregated account until these matters are resolved.\" President Trump said Thursday afternoon\u00c2\u00a0he does not know Parnas and Fruman, but might have met them at a fundraiser at one point. \"I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know those gentlemen,\" Trump said.\u00c2\u00a0\"Now, it's possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody.\" Parnas and Fruman were featured in a photo alongside the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., at a table apparently at the Beverly Hills Polo Lounge. The photo was posted on Parnas' Facebook page on May 21, 2018. Both men are accused of making false statements related to the nature of GEP and the contribution in response to the FEC complaint. BIDEN CAMPAIGN SLAMS NY TIMES FOR RUNNING \u00e2\u0080\u0098CLINTON CASH\u00e2\u0080\u0099 AUTHOR\u00e2\u0080\u0099S OP-ED ON EX-VP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s UKRAINE TIES Additionally, contributions from Fruman were allegedly made in Parnas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 name to get around federal contribution limits, and several contributions were made under the name \"Igor Furman\" instead of \"Fruman,\" allegedly \"to conceal the source of the funds and to evade federal reporting requirements.\" The indictment also claims that Parnas and Fruman \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommitted to raise $20,000 or more for a then-sitting U.S. Congressman\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0whom they had met at a political event. The congressman wasn't identified by name in court papers, but the donations to \"Congressman 1\" in the indictment match campaign finance reports for former Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who lost his re-election bid in November 2018. At approximately the same time that they made that commitment, Parnas and the Congressman discussed the Congressman's assistance in securing the removal of the then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, and this was done \"at least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials,\" the indictment alleges. The indictment also lays out allegations of a separate \"foreign national donor scheme\" involving the two men and two other defendants, American David Correia, and Ukrainian national Andrey Kukushkin. The foursome\u00c2\u00a0allegedly engaged in a conspiracy to make political contributions funded by an unnamed Russian national to obtain influence with political candidates regarding policies to benefit a recreational marijuana business venture, and to help obtain retail marijuana licenses. House Democrats on Thursday subpoenaed Parnas and Fruman as part of the impeachment inquiry into Trump. The subpoenas are for documents that the men have so far failed to provide to Congress. Parnas and Fruman were involved in Giuliani's efforts to urge Ukrainian officials to investigate Trump's political rival Joe Biden and his family. That effort was also discussed by Trump in a July call with Ukraine's president and is at the heart of the impeachment probe. Giuliani told Fox News that he represents Parnas and Fruman on a separate matter and called the timing of their arrest and indictment \"suspect.\" He added that he \"will reveal relevant facts very very shortly.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Giuliani, a personal\u00c2\u00a0attorney for\u00c2\u00a0Trump, said he finds it \"extremely suspicious\" that the arrest was made in connection with an FEC matter that has yet to be resolved, and which Giuliani said is a civil matter. He acknowledged, however, that both men \"logistically helped\" in his collection of evidence against Hunter Biden, and that they helped connect him with\u00c2\u00a0Viktor Shokin and Yuriy Lutsenko former Prosecutors General of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose July phone call with Trump jumpstarted the impeachment inquiry, denied on Thursday knowing Parnas and Fruman and said Washington so far has not requested any documents from him regarding the two men.

      "content": "  Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, implored\u00c2\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to halt what he called \u00e2\u0080\u009csecret\u00e2\u0080\u009d impeachment proceedings against President Trump Thursday, saying: \"The American public deserves to see this impeachment firsthand for themselves, not just what you, your colleagues, and your staff anonymously leak about it.\" Turner, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, took particular issue with the panel's Oct. 3 transcribed interview of former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and subsequent media leaks that he says are in \"direct contradiction with Volker's testimony.\" \"Nothing in that [Volker's] testimony was classified, and yet it was conducted behind closed doors and a transcript has yet to be released,\" Turner wrote. \"The American public deserve to witness these hearings, not just receive anonymous secondhand reports ... This represents an attempt by you [Pelosi] to totally control what information the American public is receiving in reporting on this impeachment inquiry.\" WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES IT WILL NOT COMPLY WITH 'ILLEGITIMATE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY Republicans and Democrats present at Volker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interview had wildly different interpretations of the information he provided. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told reporters after the meeting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot one thing he [Volker] said comports with any of the Democrats' impeachment narrative.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said Volker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony made it clear \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere was a shadow shakedown going on\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Ukraine led by\u00c2\u00a0Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Appearing on \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Newsroom\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thursday, Jordan pressured House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to release the full transcript of the\u00c2\u00a0Volker\u00c2\u00a0interview\u00c2\u00a0to show there was no quid pro quo agreement between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky involving U.S. military aid and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden. \"He was clear about that [and] reinforced exactly what President Zelensky said when he said, 'I was not pushed by the administration,'\" Jordan said. \"Adam Schiff won't release that. Instead, there were 67 pages of text messages. Adam Schiff took a few of those text messages and released them. Release them all.\" REP. JORDAN CHALLENGES SCHIFF TO RELEASE CLOSED-DOOR TESTIMONY THAT SHATTERS UKRAINE 'QUID PRO QUO' THEORY Turner also alleged that Democratic-led House committees \"are discussing holding not only secret hearings, but interviewing secret witnesses.\" \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are robbing the American public of their right to judge for themselves the veracity and credibility of these witnesses and this investigation,\" Turner wrote to Pelosi. \"The American public is also unable in this process to judge the professionalism, predisposition, and bias of the questioners in this inquiry.\" Turner then cited a CNN report that\u00c2\u00a0House of Representative General Counsel Doug Letter told a federal judge that\u00c2\u00a0the president did not have to commit a crime to be impeached. The question came up in a hearing over a request by the House for grand jury testimony related to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Constitution is clear: 'The President ... shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and\u00c2\u00a0Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'\u00c2\u00a0A crime must be committed. However, your legal counsel is now trying to argue blatantly against the Constitution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turner wrote (emphasis original). \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have said the country is in a constitutional crisis. You are right, Madam Speaker, we are, and it is by your design and creation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turner also raised the issue of Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staff having contact with the intelligence community\u00c2\u00a0whistleblower whose complaint prompted the formal impeachment inquiry prior to the complaint being filed. Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office acknowledged last week that the whistleblower had reached out to them before filing the complaint in mid-August, but said that Schiff himself had not had any direct contact with the whistleblower. \"The American public has a right to know the extent to which you, your colleagues, and your staff have been involved in secret discussions with the complainant on which you based your unilateral assertion of authority to commence impeachment proceedings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turner wrote.

The American public and our constitutional processes deserve transparency.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Last month, Turner stood apart from his Republican colleagues by asserting that Trump's phone call with Zelensky was \"not ok.\" \"Concerning that conversation, I want to say to the President: This is not OK. That conversation is not OK,\" Turner said during a Sept. 26 hearing with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. \"I\u00c2\u00a0think it's disappointing to the American public when they read the [conversation's]\u00c2\u00a0transcript.\"",

      "content": " Together Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren capture the support of more than half of Democratic primary voters, according to the latest Fox News national poll on the 2020 election. Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September.\u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up 6 points and a new high for her.\u00c2\u00a0Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month. While Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June. The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent.\u00c2\u00a0 Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece. CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS Biden retains top billing with strong support among non-whites, voters over age 45, and moderates/conservatives.\u00c2\u00a0 Warren has strengthened her position by increasing support among suburban voters, very liberals, and men. When Democratic primary voters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 first and second choice preferences are considered together, Biden and Warren tie at 45 percent support, Sanders is at 34 percent, Harris 15 percent and Buttigieg 13 percent. President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allegations about improper actions by Biden and his son have so far failed to chip away at Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support in the primary race -- and Democratic primary voters continue to believe the former vice president is the candidate best equipped to beat Trump in 2020:\u00c2\u00a0 43 percent feel that way, up from 42 percent last month.\u00c2\u00a0 Nineteen percent think Warren has the best chance to oust Trump and 15 percent say Sanders. At the same time, the poll finds the three top Democratic candidates with sizable leads over the president in potential head-to-head matchups. The poll, released Thursday, shows Biden (50-40 percent) and Warren (50-40 percent) both top Trump by 10 points, and Sanders is up by 9 (49-40 percent).\u00c2\u00a0 This marks the first time all three Democrats have held a lead outside the poll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s margin of error.\u00c2\u00a0 Last month, Biden was up by 14 points, Warren by 6 and Sanders by 8. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Warren continues to poll as strongly against Trump as the former vice president, it makes it increasingly difficult for the Biden team to keep making the argument he is the most electable candidate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw. The impeachment inquiry hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t caused any real shifts in the ballot test, as Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support in the two-way matchups has been between 37-42 percent all year.\u00c2\u00a0 However, the poll finds an 8-point shift since last month in the number expecting Trump will be re-elected.\u00c2\u00a0 In September, more thought he would win by a 6-point margin and now more expect he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t by 2 points. And while most Republican primary voters want to keep Trump as their party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominee, nearly one in five, 17 percent, would like to see someone else run. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo far, Trump has been able to keep his Republican base on board,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Shaw. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the percentage opposing his re-nomination creeps into the 20s, that would be a troubling sign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meanwhile, voters continue to believe Donald Trump is dishonest.\u00c2\u00a0 Sixty-three percent say that -- far more than the 35 percent who think he is honest and trustworthy.\u00c2\u00a0 By the way, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same number who said Trump was honest before he won the 2016 election.

      "content": " House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R.-Wyo., along with 20 Republican colleagues, said Thursday that legislation is being introduced to sanction Turkey for its\u00c2\u00a0military offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northern Syria. The announcement came as Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Defense Ministry boasted Thursday that more than 150 Kurdish forces have been mowed down since the\u00c2\u00a0assault began one day ago. TURKEY'S MILITARY ASSAULT IN SYRIA LEAVES MORE THAN 150 KURDISH FIGHTERS DEAD, OFFICIALS SAY \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan and his regime must face serious consequences for mercilessly attacking our Kurdish allies in northern Syria, who incurred thousands of casualties in the fight against ISIS and helped us protect the homeland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cheney. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese sanctions are not only a response to the Erdogan regime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s violent attacks in northern Syria. Congress has long had concerns about the regime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cooperation with U.S. adversaries, such as Russia. \"If Turkey wants to be treated like an ally, it must begin behaving like one. They must be sanctioned for their attacks on our Kurdish allies.\" Much to the frustration of U.S. leaders, Turkey acquired a Russian S-400 air defense system in July. The deal with Russia -- the first such arrangement between Russia and a NATO member -- raised concerns that Turkey is drifting ever closer to Moscow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sphere of influence. Cheney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office indicated that the legislation aligns with what President Trump has said\u00c2\u00a0about Turkey in the past. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTurkey has been planning to attack the Kurds for a long time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump tweeted Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say hit Turkey very hard financially & with sanctions if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play by the rules!\u00e2\u0080\u009d HOUSE DEMS SUBPOENA ENERGY SECRETARY RICK PERRY FOR UKRAINE DOCS IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assault on our Kurdish allies is reckless and reprehensible. The Kurds sacrificed 10,000 of their own men and women combatting ISIS, and we cannot allow Turkey, a NATO partner, to attack them without repercussions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said co-sponsor Adam Kinzinger, R.-Ill. Cheney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bill follows a similar one in the Senate announced Wednesday by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R.-S.C., and Chris Van Hollen, D.-Md. The Senate bill would sanction the U.S. assets of Turkish political leadership,\u00c2\u00a0restrict military transactions with any foreign entity (including the U.S.) and Turkey, and penalize\u00c2\u00a0anyone who makes\u00c2\u00a0transactions with Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy sector. Cheney, daughter of former Vice President to George W. Bush Vice President Dick Cheney,\u00c2\u00a0has repeatedly sounded off about Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to withdraw U.S. forces in northeastern Syria. In one tweet, she called it a \"catastrophic mistake that puts our gains against ISIS at risk and threatens U.S. security.\" Critics have decried the decision by Trump, which they say undermines progress against ISIS in the region and leaves a U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State vulnerable. In another, she called President Trump's pullback \"impossible to understand.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",

      "content": " Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Thursday became the latest Trump administration official to be subpoenaed in connection with the House impeachment inquiry, as a trio of House Democratic committee chairmen\u00c2\u00a0requested documents relating to Ukraine. The House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees requested \"key documents\" from Perry by Oct. 18, the chairmen announced in a press release. Department of Energy (DOE) Spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes told Fox News, \"The Department of Energy is aware of the House Committees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 letter to Secretary Perry and it is currently under review by DOE's Office of General Counsel.\" Democrats have already subpoenaed\u00c2\u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the\u00c2\u00a0Pentagon, the White House Office of Management and Budget\u00c2\u00a0and U.S. Ambassador to the\u00c2\u00a0European Union\u00c2\u00a0Gordon Sondland for documents as lawmakers probe a\u00c2\u00a0July 25 phone call between President Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRecently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stark message to the Ukrainian president,\" Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff, Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel said\u00c2\u00a0of Perry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese reports have also raised significant questions about your efforts to press Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company to benefit individuals involved with Rudy Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s push to get Ukrainian officials to interfere in our 2020 election.\" Two associates of Trump lawyer and confidant\u00c2\u00a0Rudy Giuliani\u00c2\u00a0who have been linked to his efforts to conduct\u00c2\u00a0investigations in Ukraine were\u00c2\u00a0indicted for campaign finance violations, according to court documents released Thursday. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are accused of using a limited liability company to make political contributions related to American elections, which violates Federal Election Commission (FEC) rules barring contributions from foreign nationals. GIULIANI\u00c2\u00a0ASSOCIATES ARRESTED WHILE TRYING TO BOARD INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT WITH ONE-WAY TICKETS, PROSECUTORS SAY The expanding impeachment probe was launched last month after an intelligence community member's\u00c2\u00a0whistleblower complaint\u00c2\u00a0raised concerns about the president's Ukraine phone call.\u00c2\u00a0In it, Trump asked Zelensky to probe onetime Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter and their business dealings in Ukraine. Joe Biden has for months been seen as the Democrats' frontrunner in the 2020 election against Trump. Trump has denied abusing his position, saying the call was \"perfect,\" and Zelensky said Thursday there was \"no blackmail\" during their call. The whistleblower accused the president of \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\" claiming Trump\u00c2\u00a0used\u00c2\u00a0$400 million in military aid, frozen in the days before that fateful phone call,\u00c2\u00a0to induce Zelensky to open a\u00c2\u00a0Biden inquiry. Trump reportedly told House Republicans it was Perry who suggested he call Zelensky back in July, according to news outlet Axios. RICK PERRY DENIES DISCUSSING BIDENS WITH TRUMP OR UKRAINE OFFICIALS: REPORTS According to one source, Trump said something to the effect of: \"Not a lot of people know this but, I didn't even want to make the call. The only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to. Something about an LNG [liquified natural gas] plant,\" Axios reported, saying two other sources agreed with that recollection. Perry denied ever mentioning the Bidens during discussions with Ukrainian officials or the president. On Friday he told the Christian Broadcasting Network in an exclusive interview that his dealings in Ukraine were part of the United States' effort to clean up corruption there. President Trump has said Joe Biden's efforts to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the energy firm\u00c2\u00a0Burisma Holdings -- where Hunter Biden had held a board seat\u00c2\u00a0-- should be investigated for corruption. On Monday, Perry denied rumors that he would resign at the end of November amid questions about his role in the controversy surrounding the now-infamous Trump-Zelensky call. READ THE\u00c2\u00a0WHITE HOUSE LETTER The White House issued an eight-page letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on\u00c2\u00a0Tuesday and said\u00c2\u00a0it\u00c2\u00a0wouldn't comply\u00c2\u00a0with the \"illegitimate and unconstitutional\" impeachment inquiry.

      "content": " The top Republican on the House Committee on House Administration\u00c2\u00a0urged the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) inspector general\u00c2\u00a0on Thursday to investigate the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leader\u00c2\u00a0for allegedly using her position to publicly disparage President Trump, including making multiple media appearances in which she referred to the president as a danger to democracy. The request by Rodney Davis, R-Ill.\u00c2\u00a0was outlined in a 4-page memo to FEC Inspector General Christopher L. Skinner. In it, Davis chastised FEC Chair Ellen L. Weintraub for using government time and resources for \u00e2\u0080\u009cideological, and at times, political, purposes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He recounted four instances where Weintraub had used FEC resources to publish her personal opinions on President Trump. In a February 2017 statement issued on FEC letterhead, Weintraub requested the president show evidence of \"alleged voter fraud in New Hampshire,\"\u00c2\u00a0a reference to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim that illegal voting had cost him the state's four electoral votes in the 2016 presidential election. In a March follow-up letter, Weintraub reiterated that request. In May 2017, Weintraub wrote a statement, again on FEC letterhead, rebuking Trump for his creation of an Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. President, take responsibility for your words. Document them if you can. Apologize to them if you have to. But don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ship them off to a commission.\u00e2\u0080\u009d FEC CHAIR: TRUMP IS 'DAMAGING TO OUR DEMOCRACY' WITH 'BASELESS' VOTER FRAUD ALLEGATIONS Weintraub wrote a second letter to Trump about his New Hampshire voter fraud claims in August 2019 in a tone Davis described as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartisan snark.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo put it in terms a former casino operator should understand: There comes a time when you need to lay your cards on the fable or fold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote. The letter was not hosted on the FEC website, but was drafted with the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letterhead and appeared on Weintraub\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter feed, according to Davis. Davis also criticized Weintraub for appearances on CNN and MSNBC to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscuss matters outside the purview of the FEC.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On at least two occasions, Weintraub\u00c2\u00a0dismissed Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claims as \u00e2\u0080\u009cconspiracy theories\u00e2\u0080\u009d that are \u00e2\u0080\u009cdamaging to our democracy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Davis argued that Weintraub had violated the FEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nonpartisan position by failing to indicate \u00e2\u0080\u009cin any interview that she was speaking as a private citizen and not as Chair of the nonpartisan FEC.\u00e2\u0080\u009d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Because of her ostensible bias against President Trump, Weintraub \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould publicly admit her political differences with the President, disclose her conflict of interest, and at the very least, recuse herself from voting on Matters Under Review involving the President,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Davis wrote. Responding to Davis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 memo\u00c2\u00a0via Twitter, Weintraub wrote she would \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot be silenced\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cindependence of the United States Federal Election Commission will not be compromised.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reached out to for comment, Weintraub directed Fox News to the tweet.",

Bob Kroll, president of the \u00c2\u00a0Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis,\u00c2\u00a0said at the \"Keep America Great rally\" at the Target Center in Minnesota. \"They don't want the police here when it's a Republican who stands up for the police, but if it's a Democrat we get a different story.

Kroll and other officers appeared at the rally in\u00c2\u00a0bright red \u00e2\u0080\u009cCops for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u009d T-shirts, which Trump pointed to during the rally. \"I love you guys,\" Trump said, giving Kroll a shoutout along with the rest of the police force before inviting him to join him and other union officers on the stage.\u00c2\u00a0\"You are\u00c2\u00a0so great, so respected, you don't even know how much our public loves you.\" \"How can you thank this guy for everything he's done for law enforcement? Wonderful president,\" Kroll said in return. Kroll also condemned Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who released a statement denouncing Trump's visit to the city last week. \"Our entire city will not stand behind the president, but behind the communities and people who continue to make our city -- and this country -- great,\" said Frey, a Democrat. \"While there is no legal mechanism to prevent the president from visiting, his message of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis.\" \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe mayor said the president wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t welcome but the Police Federation of Minneapolis begs to differ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kroll said as the crowd cheered. Kroll slammed the Democratic Party,\u00c2\u00a0which\u00c2\u00a0has held sway in the state for close to 47 years, and which Trump is determined to flip in the upcoming election.

The whistleblower's anti-Trump attorney, Mark Zaid, acknowledged earlier in the week that his client had \"contact\" with current presidential contenders \"from both parties.\" The president also derided the Biden campaign for aggressively seeking to convince Facebook and The New York Times, as well as all major television networks,\u00c2\u00a0not to cover what it called \"conspiracy theories\" about potential Biden corruption. Scores of Trump supporters, as well as pro-impeachment demonstrators, lined up hours before the event at the Target Center in downtown Minneapolis began. At least one protester was photographed pouring milk on his face to counter the effects of pepper spray, as chaos unfolded outside the arena -- with pro-Trump hats being lit on fire, as some demonstrators\u00c2\u00a0harassed police and assaulted Trump supporters. \"The Bidens got rich -- and that is substantiated -- while America got robbed,\" Trump said. \"Sleepy Joe and his friends sold out America. ... And in a brand new report, just came out as I'm walking on the stage, it turns out that when Joe Biden was vice president -- he worked with the so-called whistleblower.\u00c2\u00a0 This is nothing more than a partisan witch hunt, sabotage, and I'm sure they're going to say, 'totally unsubstantiated.'\" As the crowd erupted into applause, Trump remarked, \"Isn't it much better when I go off script? So much better.\" Trump set a fiery tone within minutes of taking the stage, as he relentlessly mocked ex-FBI officials and lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page with a passionate\u00c2\u00a0dramatic reading of their anti-Trump text messages. He also touted the country's economy and suggested the U.S. will prevail in its trade war with China -- without mentioning the growing issue of censorship in the U.S. over ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The rally, Trump's first since the House moved toward impeachment over his handling of a July phone call with Ukraine's president, was in a state Trump nearly won in 2016 and has talked frequently of capturing in 2020. But, it took place in a traditionally liberal city and the home turf of a frequent foil, Rep. Ilhan Omar. To loud booing during the rally, Trump slammed the Democrat as \"an America-hating socialist\" who \"minimized the September 11 terror attack on our homeland.\" He also outlined comments from Omar that even top Democrats have admitted were anti-Semitic, before asking, \"How do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota? I'm very angry at you people. She is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that I am going to win, and that the Republican Party is going to win, Minnesota in 13 months.\" A chant of \"four more years\" broke out -- in sharp contrast to the \"send her back\"\u00c2\u00a0rallying cry\u00c2\u00a0from a July rally in North Carolina that was directed at Omar. Trump later condemned that chant, which came after the president asked why unnamed \"Democrat Congresswomen\" didn't \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came, then come back and show us how it is done.\" WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY ADMITS CLIENT HAD CONTACT WITH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, AS LAWYER'S ANTI-TRUMP BIAS SURFACES Trump hit Democrats for bringing in too\u00c2\u00a0many refugees without proper security controls, noting that he has \"reduced refugee resettlement by 85 percent\" since taking office. The president thanked Mexico for agreeing to deploy its soldiers to help curtail illegal immigration at the border pursuant to a deal the White House struck earlier this year -- a move that Trump said would help avert a humanitarian crisis like the one unfolding in Europe. Later in the rally, Trump explained his decision to\u00c2\u00a0expose U.S.-allied Kurds to Turkish invasion by telling the crowd how difficult it was to inform the families of fallen U.S. servicemembers how \"their child has died.\" Keeping troops on guard to prevent Turkish incursion, Trump said, was an unnecessary risk of U.S. personnel. TUCKER: OUTRAGE OVER TRUMP'S KURD DECISION SHOWS HOW PERVERSE D.C. IS \"I have to sign these letters,\" Trump said, saying it also was \"very tough\" to go to Dover Air Force Base to \"meet the parents and families and wives and children, sisters and brothers\" of fallen soldiers who arrive in coffins. \"It's time to bring 'em home,\" Trump said to applause, referring generally to U.S. soldiers overseas. \"We've done our job.\" At the rally, Trump said over 20,000 people were inside the arena -- and over 25,000 were outside, out of nearly 100,000 who indicated online they wanted to attend. Before the president took the stage, his son Eric Trump briefly encouraged a \"lock him up\" chant directed at Joe and Hunter Biden, before telling the crowd it wouldn't be necessary because Biden will lose his bid for the White House. ANDY MCCARTHY TAKES A LOOK AT DEMS' IMPEACHMENT PUSH The president turned to\u00c2\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's comments earlier Thursday concerning\u00c2\u00a0their fateful phone call. Zelensky unequivocally told reporters the call involved no bribe, blackmail or quid pro quo, as impeachment-minded Democrats claimed. \"That should be the end of it,\" Trump told rallygoers. \"We released a transcript of that call, which was so good that Crooked [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam Schiff had to make up a fake conversation that never happened, and he delivered it to the United States Congress and the American people. It was a total fraud. And then, [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi said, 'Oh, I think the president said that.'\u00c2\u00a0These people are sick.\" Trump argued that Democrats never anticipated he\u00c2\u00a0would release a full transcript of his call with Zelensky, and recklessly locked themselves into their impeachment inquiry before they even read the document. \"Where's Hunter?\" Trump asked rallygoers at one point, referring to Biden's son. Both Joe and Hunter Biden mostly have avoided taking questions about their Ukraine\u00c2\u00a0dealings in recent days. The president then launched into a mock interview with Hunter, whom Trump called \"not too smart.\" \"Hunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly. Hunter, you're a loser,\" Trump said, his voice rising.\u00c2\u00a0\"Your father was never considered smart, he was never considered a good senator -- he was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's a--.\" UKRAINE PRESIDENT SAYS 'NO BLACKMAIL' IN CALL WITH TRUMP Critics have\u00c2\u00a0alleged\u00c2\u00a0Hunter -- who secured a lucrative role on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings while his father was vice president --\u00c2\u00a0might have been selling access to his father, who had pushed Ukraine to increase its natural-gas production. Police removed protesters throughout the rally, which went ahead as scheduled even after Trump's campaign\u00c2\u00a0threatened a lawsuit over the city's effort to recover $530,000 in security costs relating to the event. The dispute over the rally's security costs erupted late Monday when the campaign accused Mayor Jacob Frey, a Trump critic, of trying to sink the rally. Frey called the costs reasonable and said he had a duty to protect taxpayers. The campaign said the city sent the security cost estimate to Target Center's operator, AEG Management, which threatened to cancel its contract to host the rally if the costs weren't covered. Its law firm threatened to sue AEG if the rally doesn't proceed. LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS BIDEN, WARREN GAINING -- SANDERS SLIPPING Trump attacked Frey Tuesday on Twitter, writing: \"Someone please tell the Radical Left Mayor of Minneapolis that he can't price out Free Speech. Probably illegal!\" His campaign said the \"bogus security charges\" are an attempt to prevent Minneapolis residents from supporting Trump, and contrasted them with what they said were much smaller charges for a 2009 event by then-President Barack Obama in the same building. \"The radical leftist mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, is abusing the power of his office and attempting to extort President Trump's re-election campaign,\" Trump's campaign said in a statement. LEGAL EXPERTS WEIGH IN AS WHITE HOUSE OBJECTS TO INQUIRY When the rally was announced last month, Frey said Trump's \"message of hatred\" would never be welcome in Minnesota. But, at a news conference Tuesday, he said the city will do all it can to guarantee a \"safe and peaceful week,\" regardless of his political differences with Trump. Frey stood by the security-cost\u00c2\u00a0estimate, saying a Trump political rally would bring \"significant expenses\" not associated with Obama's 2009 event, which was aimed at building support for health-care reform. Later Tuesday, the Trump campaign said in a statement that the operators of Target Center had backed off canceling the contract, with no agreement by the campaign to pay additional money. AEG didn't respond to messages seeking comment. Trump also attacked Frey over Twitter for a policy prohibiting\u00c2\u00a0city police officers from wearing their uniforms in support of candidates at political events or in campaign ads. A spokesman for the city's police union has complained about the policy, and the union has been selling \"Cops for Trump\" T-shirts. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Frey said the police force must be nonpartisan and non-ideological. \"They're free to express their First Amendment rights but should do so off-duty,\" he said.

Police officers on horseback and bicycles formed a protective line in front of the arena, according to The Tribune. Officers with riot batons and shields also maneuvered through the crowd of protesters.

Trump arrived in Minnesota as polls show Americans' support rising for impeachment. Democrats claim he used his office to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens for his political gain. Trump insists that he was just making sure the country was doing its part to weed out corruption.

While the president has been front-and-center in the Ukraine\u00c2\u00a0controversy\u00c2\u00a0that sparked House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump, Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another key player, and with the impeachment push overshadowing the 2020 White House race, the Democrat has\u00c2\u00a0grabbed outsized attention over his rivals for the presidential nomination. BIDEN, WARREN, GAIN GROUND IN NEW FOX NEWS POLL It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a double-edged sword for the former vice president, with Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allegations against Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own Ukraine connection also in the spotlight. Biden on Wednesday launched\u00c2\u00a0a forceful attack on the president \u00e2\u0080\u0093 coming from a candidate who in recent weeks was anything but aggressive in calling for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment, unlike most of his 2020 rivals. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no joke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden emphasized during two speeches in New Hampshire. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement\u00c2\u00a0came one day after\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0White House vowed not to play ball with the House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0impeachment inquiry, but it also came as the former vice president lost his polling status as the unrivaled front-runner. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the top spot in most of the recent national and early-voting-state surveys, although he held a lead in the latest Fox News Poll. FOR FIRST TIME, BIDEN CALLS FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT And, Biden was left in the dust in the race for campaign cash, with both Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each topping him by roughly $10 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising. With those setbacks in mind, the unveiling of the more aggressive, in-your-face approach by Biden has been seen as considerably timely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt gets his sea legs under him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted Larry Rasky, a longtime Biden friend, adviser\u00c2\u00a0and fundraiser. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt gives everybody more energy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rasky, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not directly involved in Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2020 campaign, predicted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely going to help fundraising.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added that donors \u00e2\u0080\u009care happy to see Biden taking on the fight with intensity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden, in his speeches, taunted the president, claiming \u00e2\u0080\u009che\u00e2\u0080\u0099s afraid of just how badly I will beat him next November.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran noted that such swagger would resonate with voters. She also said the Ukraine controversy put\u00c2\u00a0the spotlight on foreign relations, a wheelhouse for the former vice president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis remarks yesterday came across as an \u00e2\u0080\u0098enough is enough\u00e2\u0080\u0099 call to action and reminder to the American electorate of the fighter and statesman they have long known,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era\u00c2\u00a0grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies. The impeachment inquiry was sparked by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in\u00c2\u00a0the eastern European country. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats\u00c2\u00a0argued the president was asking a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election. Adding to the controversy was the fact that before that phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine was put on hold. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage,\u00c2\u00a0Trump has insisted repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no \"quid pro quo\"\u00c2\u00a0and on numerous occasions has described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d BIDEN CAMPAIGN SLAMS NY TIMES FOR OP-ED ON FORMER VP'S UKRAINE TIES The president and allies instead have tried to put the spotlight\u00c2\u00a0on Biden and his son. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how\u00c2\u00a0Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who had faced widespread\u00c2\u00a0accusations\u00c2\u00a0of overlooking corruption in his own office\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 later was dismissed. Biden, defending his actions in Ukraine, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no truth to [Trump's]\u00c2\u00a0charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biden also accused the president of throwing \u00e2\u0080\u009clies and distortions and smears\u00e2\u0080\u009d at him and his son, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause he thinks he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll undermine my candidacy for the nomination as well as the presidency if I am the nominee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While the Fox News national poll released Wednesday indicated that a majority said the president should be impeached and removed from office, Biden has faced warning signs of his own. MAJORITY BACK TRUMP IMPEACHMENT IN LATEST FOX NEWS POLL Thirty-six percent questioned in the survey said they found the Trump allegations against Biden extremely or very troubling. That included 34 percent of independents and even 24 percent of Democrats. Longtime Republican strategist Colin Reed highlighted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe discussion involving Ukraine is going to involve a continued focus on why Hunter Biden was being paid $50,000 a month to sit on the board of an energy company with him having absolutely no expertise in that area.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reed emphasized, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that crony capitalism does not sit well with voters in the center, right\u00c2\u00a0or left.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increased criticism aimed at the president likely will incite further attacks from Trump.

      "content": " The Ukraine whistleblower at the center of the House Democratic impeachment inquiry wants to testify to Congress in writing instead of appearing in person, Fox News has confirmed. The Wall Street Journal first\u00c2\u00a0reported that lawyers for the anonymous CIA officer have asked lawmakers if the whistleblower could submit testimony in writing, but the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have\u00c2\u00a0not yet responded. WHISTLEBLOWER LAWYER ACKNOWLEDGES CLIENT HAD 'CONTACT' WITH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES The request comes amid Democrats' desire to\u00c2\u00a0protect\u00c2\u00a0the identity\u00c2\u00a0of the whistleblower, along with worries over safety and media scrutiny. President Trump and Republicans believe the president should have a right to confront his accuser, and have also cited new reports indicating the whistleblower could have partisan motives. His attorneys have acknowledged he is a registered Democrat who has worked with at least one 2020 candidate. On Thursday, reports surfaced that the candidate was Joe Biden. Democrats formally\u00c2\u00a0launched an impeachment inquiry\u00c2\u00a0after the\u00c2\u00a0anonymous whistleblower filed a complaint about President Trump pressing Ukrainian officials this summer to investigate 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business activities in Ukraine.

Trump has pushed for information on the identity of the Ukraine whistleblower. In recent tweets, the president has asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we entitled to interview & learn everything about the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all of the false information to him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During a rally in Minnesota on Thursday night, Trump cited a new report in The Washington Examiner that the whistleblower at the center of Democrats' impeachment push had worked with Biden. The whistleblower's anti-Trump attorney, Mark Zaid, acknowledged earlier in the week that his client had \"contact\" with current presidential contenders \"from both parties.\" TRUMP BELITTLES BIDENS WITH GRAPHIC LANGUAGE AT MINNEAPOLIS RALLY, AS CHAOS UNFOLDS OUTSIDE ARENA Fox News recently reported of the possibility that a secret session between the whistleblower and lawmakers could be held away from the U.S. Capitol complex. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBringing someone up here [to Capitol Hill]\u00c2\u00a0is tough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one congressional source who asked to not be identified. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear where lawmakers could hold such a forum with the whistleblower. A secure facility exists on Capitol Hill, as well as in various quarters of government \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ranging from the Department of Justice to the intelligence community. Earlier this week, the whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorneys said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whistleblower is not the story. To date, virtually every substantive allegation has been confirmed by other sources. For that reason the identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant.\" Fox News\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Griff Jenkins, Gregg Re and Chad Pergram\u00c2\u00a0contributed to this report.",

Meet Eric Early, Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading Republican challenger, who minces no words when it comes to his desire to send the longstanding Democratic \u00e2\u0080\u009cviper into retirement and help give Congress back to the people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d FORMER CIA WHISTLEBLOWER BLASTS MEDIA, DISMISSES UNNAMED OFFICIAL WHO FLAGGED TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL \u00e2\u0080\u009cSchiff could not care less about our district.

But defeating Schiff in 2020 will be a tall order: Schiff won his race with nearly\u00c2\u00a078.4 percent of the vote in 2018. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI refer to him (Schiff) as a National Disgrace.\u00c2\u00a0It is becoming more and more evident that Schiff and his team likely clandestinely worked together with a conflicted and tremendously biased deep state Trump hater to orchestrate this latest outrage to try to destroy a duly elected American president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat in and of itself should disqualify Schiff from overseeing the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u0098inquiry.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Holding nothing back when it comes to his condemnation and zingers of his political opponent, Early has also accused Schiff of being something akin to a media hog, which was illuminated by his involvement in the two-year-long Russia investigation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSchiff appeared on national news shows over 400 times during that period, repeatedly telling every American how he had and had seen evidence that made it clear the president had colluded with the Russians to win the election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Early continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the then-ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, Schiff made the world believe that his knowledge was based on among other things, his access to classified information.\u00c2\u00a0Now Schiff never says the word Russia, but his two straight years of lies will forever be left in the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consciousness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In June, the L.A power attorney for more than 25 years made the bold move to throw his hat into the ring \u00e2\u0080\u0093 having become fed up with Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuous \u00e2\u0080\u009clies on TV.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But it is not Early\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first foray into politics. He ran unsuccessfully for California attorney general in 2018 but claims that the experience prepared him for a run against Schiff. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI spoke to people all around California, met many amazing people, received almost a million votes statewide, and thoroughly enjoyed campaigning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy legal background has been great preparation for this role.

      "author": "Gregg Re",
      "content": " Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. envoy to Kiev and someone President Trump has privately called \"bad news,\" is scheduled to sit for a potentially explosive transcribed interview with lawmakers and staff on Capitol Hill on Friday as Democrats intensify their impeachment inquiry. But after the White House abruptly\u00c2\u00a0blocked U.S. Ambassador to the E.U.\u00c2\u00a0Gordon Sondland from testifying shortly before his planned appearance on Tuesday, it remained unclear whether\u00c2\u00a0Yovanovitch would appear at all. The White House announced this week it would not comply at all with what it called Democrats' \"unconstitutional\" proceedings. However, multiple sources told Fox News late Thursday that Sondland will\u00c2\u00a0indeed appear for a transcribed interview before House investigators next Wednesday, defying the State Department. \"Notwithstanding the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday,\" read a statement released by Sondland. It also comes amid some internal drama at the State Department. Fox News has confirmed that Michael McKinley, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, resigned this week. As of now, Fox News is told\u00c2\u00a0that the plan is for only House Intelligence Committee staff and members to pose questions to Yovanovitch, should the ex-diplomat show up as scheduled at 10 a.m. ET. No staffers from the Foreign Affairs or Oversight Committees, majority or minority party, are expected to be able to ask questions. But\u00c2\u00a0Republicans will be allowed to have a second aide in the room after complaining last time, Fox News is told. It's unclear how long the session is likely to run. HERE'S WHY THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT WON'T COMPLY WITH DEMS' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY Trump and his surrogates have painted Yovanovitch as a rogue State Department employee with an anti-Trump political bias. Her ouster in May came amid alleged attempts by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani to press Ukraine into investigating\u00c2\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son. Those efforts triggered the impeachment inquiry. The former New York mayor labeled Yovanovitch a political hack bent on undermining Trump's efforts, charges that apparently resonated with the president. On Thursday, federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment alleging in part that two donors to a pro-Trump fundraising committee were engaged in lobbying efforts in the U.S. on behalf of a Ukrainian politician to seek Yovanovitch's ouster. The Soviet-born defendants,\u00c2\u00a0Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, are U.S. citizens who helped Giuliani's efforts to pursue an investigation of Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine. Meanwhile,\u00c2\u00a0Ukraine's president insisted Thursday that he faced \"no blackmail\" from Trump in the July 25\u00c2\u00a0phone call between the two men that led to an impeachment inquiry. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said for the first time that his country will \"happily\" investigate the conspiracy theory pushed by Trump that it was Ukrainians, not Russians, who interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. And he encouraged U.S. and Ukrainian prosecutors to discuss investigating the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings. GIULIANI ASSOCIATES TIED TO UKRAINE PROBES INDICTED ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATIONS Biden\u00c2\u00a0has acknowledged\u00c2\u00a0that in spring 2016, when he was vice president and spearheading the Obama administration's Ukraine policy, he successfully pressured\u00c2\u00a0Ukraine to fire top prosecutor\u00c2\u00a0Viktor Shokin. At the time, Shokin was investigating\u00c2\u00a0Burisma Holdings\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0where Hunter had a\u00c2\u00a0lucrative role\u00c2\u00a0on the board despite limited relevant expertise. The vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin, who was widely accused of corruption,\u00c2\u00a0was not fired. The impact of any news from the interview with\u00c2\u00a0Yovanovitch may be blunted temporarily because both the House and Senate formally remain on recess until next Tuesday. The House Democratic Caucus and Republican Conferences will hold their formal meetings and press conferences on Wednesday morning. Yovanovitch, a State Department employee for 33 years who also led U.S. embassies in Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, has drawn praise from colleagues for her past work on international affairs. She is \"a top-notch diplomat, careful, meticulous, whip-smart,\" and unlikely to have badmouthed Trump, either to Ukrainian officials or her colleagues, said John Herbst, a predecessor as ambassador in Ukraine who worked alongside Yovanovitch there in the early 2000s. That reputation is all but impossible to square with what some view as a smear campaign, capped by the Trump administration's\u00c2\u00a0removal of Yovanovitch from her post\u00c2\u00a0this year. BIDEN CAMPAIGN SEEKS TO BAR GIULIANI FROM TV\u00c2\u00a0...\u00c2\u00a0THEN GOES AFTER NEW YORK TIMES \"The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news,\" Trump told Ukraine President Zelenskiy during their\u00c2\u00a0July 25 call, according to a partial transcript released by the White House. \"She's going to go through some things.\" Currently a State Department fellow at Georgetown's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, Yovanovitch was declining all requests to speak with reporters in advance of her planned testimony. Yovanovitch, 60, was raised in a household that helped prepare her for a career in international relations. Born in Canada to immigrant parents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 her father from the former Soviet Union,\u00c2\u00a0her mother from Germany \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she grew up speaking Russian at home. The family moved to Connecticut when she was a young child, and she later became a U.S. citizen. \"Like so many, including those in the Ukrainian-American community, my parents' lives were changed forever by Communist and Nazi regimes,\" Yovanovitch said during a Senate confirmation hearing in 2016, attended by her 88-year-old mother. \"They survived poverty, war and displacement, and finally arrived in the United States, with me in tow, in search of freedom, opportunity, dignity and accountability.\" Yovanovitch attended Princeton, where she majored in history and Russian studies. She joined the Foreign Service six years later, working as deputy director of the Russian desk before being posted to Canada, Russia, Great Britain and Somalia. From 2001 to 2004, she worked as the U.S. deputy chief of mission in Ukraine, as second in charge to Herbst, before being named ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, then to Armenia. She returned to Ukraine after President Barack Obama nominated her to be ambassador in 2016. FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS RECORD SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT She arrived in Kiev two years after Russia's forced annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and its continuing military intervention. As an envoy, Yovanovitch sought to reassure Ukrainian officials of U.S. support, while\u00c2\u00a0pushing them to root out widespread\u00c2\u00a0corruption. \"The old oligarch system is still clinging to life, and corruption is its life support,\" she said in a speech in January to new graduates of the Ukrainian Leadership Academy. \"Ukraine must continue to pursue economic reforms in line with European standards and fully empower all of its anti-corruption institutions.\" Some Ukrainian officials, including the country's top prosecutor, bridled at\u00c2\u00a0the pressure from the U.S. ambassador. In March, the prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, claimed that Yovanovitch had given him a list of people he should not prosecute. The State Department dismissed the statement as baseless and Lutsenko later recanted his claim. But critics, led by Giuliani, accused her of working to undermine Trump's interests. \"The embassy in Ukraine was a 'Hillary Clinton for president' office. And they were looking to dig up dirt on President Trump,\" Giuliani said. \"There was a lot more collusion with Ukraine than in Russia, where there doesn't appear to be any. They were trying to bring Trump down.\" As part of Senate confirmation hearings to ambassadorial posts, Yovanovitch reported that she made several small contributions to Democratic candidates in the early 2000s, but none more recently. She returned to Washington in 2012 and 2013, serving as the State Department's day-to-day contact with U.S. officials in Europe. Lee Feinstein, the U.S. ambassador to Poland at the time, recalled extended conversations with Yovanovitch about how to calibrate negotiations over missile development and a continuing U.S. military presence there. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"She was always the kind of person who was very, very supportive of her ambassadors and looking to help them do their jobs better,\" said Feinstein, now dean of the Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Relations at Indiana University. \"Never somebody who was trying to pursue her own agenda.\" Fox News' Nick\u00c2\u00a0Kalman,\u00c2\u00a0Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said Friday that Democratic lawmakers should get the documents they have subpoenaed from Mazars USA.

TRUMP GRANTED REPRIEVE ON TAX RETURN CASE AFTER FEDERAL JUDGE ISSUES BLISTERING RULING Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal team told Fox News they are \u00e2\u0080\u009creviewing options.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Options include a request for the appeal to be heard \u00e2\u0080\u009cen banc\u00e2\u0080\u009d or, possibly, taking it to the Supreme Court. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile we are reviewing the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lengthy decision, as well as Judge Rao\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dissent, we continue to believe that this subpoena is not a legitimate exercise of Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legislative authority,\" said Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president. The Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform subpoenaed records from Mazars in April.

The other judges are Patricia Millett, appointed by President Barack Obama, and David Tatel, appointed by President Bill Clinton.

      "content": " Two diplomats at the center of the Ukraine controversy are now set to testify before House lawmakers as part of Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 impeachment inquiry, despite significant pushback from both the State Department and the White House. Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. envoy to Kiev and someone President Trump has privately called \"bad news,\" arrived on Capitol Hill Friday\u00c2\u00a0for a potentially explosive transcribed interview with lawmakers and staff. TRUMP ALLED FORMER UKRAINE DIPLOMAT 'BAD NEWS'...AND NOW SHE'S SET TO TESTIFY Trump and his allies have sought to paint Yovanovitch as a rogue employee with an anti-Trump bias. She was ousted in May amid alleged attempts by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani to press Ukraine into investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.\u00c2\u00a0 Those efforts ultimately led to the impeachment inquiry after the revelation\u00c2\u00a0of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- in which Trump asked the premier to \u00e2\u0080\u009clook into\u00e2\u0080\u009d the allegations about Biden's conduct in the country. While Yovanovitch, a long-time diplomat, has been praised by her colleagues as a \"top-notch diplomat,\" Trump depicted\u00c2\u00a0her in the call with Zelensky as \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad news\u00e2\u0080\u009d and someone who is \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoing to go through some things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Giuliani and other critics have accused her of working to undermine Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interests. Also Friday, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland announced that he will testify before Congress. The announcement comes\u00c2\u00a0a week after the State Department directed him not to appear before lawmakers at a scheduled deposition. The shift comes after House Democrats on Wednesday subpoenaed him to appear before the joint committees to testify. He said in a statement that he is scheduled to appear on Thursday. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BLOCKS AMBASSADOR FROM TESTIFYING IN HOUSE IMPEACHMENT DEPOSITION \u00e2\u0080\u009cNotwithstanding the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the statement said. \"Ambassador Sondland has at all times acted with integrity and in the interests of the United States. He has no agenda apart from answering the Committees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 questions fully and truthfully.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump had dismissed the deposition as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ckangaroo court,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while Democrats warned that a failure of Sondland and other witnesses to appear was evidence of obstruction of Congress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify,\" Trump tweeted, \"but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see.\" Democrats claim that Trump used $400 million in military aid as leverage in a quid pro quo for the Ukrainians to investigate a political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and opened an impeachment inquiry, firing off a raft of subpoenas within a few days to top administration and White House officials. While a call transcript shows the president urging a Biden-related investigation, Trump denies any 'quid pro quo' claims. Sondland is a wealthy hotelier, philanthropist and contributor to political campaigns. He is a key figure as he had texted with Bill Taylor, a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, arguing over allegations of a quid pro quo. In early September, Taylor wrote: \"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" Days later, he followed up: \"As I said over the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\" Sondland responded, defending the president: \"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is not clear how much of the change in Sondland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position is his own, and how much the Trump administration has shifted on the question of whether he should appear. Axios reported Friday that Republicans close to Trump encouraged the president to let the ambassador come before the committees and that his allies believe Sondland's testimony will be helpful to them. CLICK HERE FOR\u00c2\u00a0THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM But the White House has been aggressive in its pushback against the impeachment inquiry, which it sees as illegitimate and politically motivated. On Wednesday the White House issued a defiant letter saying it would not cooperate with the inquiry. \"President Trump and his administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process,\" the letter stated.\u00c2\u00a0\"Your unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice. In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\" Fox News' Gregg Re, Lillian LeCroy, Nick Kalman, Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Sullivan will replace Jon Huntsman, who left the post last week. Fox News reported in August that Trump intended to nominate Sullivan. The Wall Street Journal first reported Friday that Moscow agreed to accredit Sullivan -- a precursor to a formal nomination. US PULLS OUT OF REAGAN-ERA ARMS TREATY, SAYING RUSSIA 'MADE NO EFFORTS' TO COMPLY Sullivan, a lawyer with a long history of federal service, has been deputy secretary of state since May 2017 when the Senate confirmed him 94-6.

Sullivan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career in government dates back to 1991, when he served as counselor to Assistant Attorney General J. Michael Luttig in the Justice Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Legal Counsel. During the administration of President George W. Bush, Sullivan served as deputy general counsel to the State Department before moving on to the role of general counsel at the Department of Commerce. The Journal reports that he is currently leading a pair of ongoing dialogues with Russia relating to counterterrorism and strategic security. Sources told the outlet that Sullivan played an important role in the expulsion of Russia diplomats after the poisoning of a former double agent and his daughter in England in 2018.

Frese, who pleaded not guilty two days ago, was arraigned in a Virginia federal court. He made no statements in court and no new evidence was presented against him during the bond hearing. A federal indictment against the 30-year-old, who is accused of using his position to pass on \"top secret\" information about foreign countries' weapons systems, was unsealed Wednesday. \"Frese was caught red-handed disclosing sensitive national security\u00c2\u00a0information for personal gain,\" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said in a press release. \"Frese betrayed the trust placed in him by the American people-- a betrayal that risked harming the national security of this country.\" Frese's alleged motive was to advance the career of a female reporter he was having a relationship with, the FBI said in court documents. Frese allegedly also passed information to one of the woman's female colleagues at an \"affiliated but different news outlet.\" Authorities did not disclose the names of the two journalists but the Justice Department said they were from NBC and CNBC and cover national security. Frese's case is one of six authorized disclosure cases that the Justice Department has cracked down on during the Trump administration.

What I hear from folks time and time again is nothing meaningful came out of these debates and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re often disconnected from peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said Friday. Bullock spoke with reporters from Fox News, NBC News, and NPR after headlining the \"Politics and Eggs\"\u00c2\u00a0speaking series, a must-stop for White House hopefuls in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire. BULLOCK ACCUSES STEYER OF BUYING HIS WAY ONTO DEBATE STAGE Bullock, who launched his campaign in the late spring, qualified for the second round of debates but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reach the Democratic National Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s polling and fundraising criteria to make the cut for last month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s showdown or Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate, which will be held in Ohio. The DNC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raising the thresholds again for candidates to make the stage for November\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth round showdown, which will be held in Atlanta. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is in a similar situation. He jumped into the race relatively late and qualified for the first two rounds of debates, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make the stage last month and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be in the debate spotlight next week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had to make a decision on the debate stage, whether I was going to keep laundering money through Facebook to try to stay on a debate stage that was pre-season football, that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to make a difference in the standings, or whether I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bennet explained in an interview on Tuesday with Fox News and NHTalkRadio.com. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI decided I was going to talk to voters directly in Iowa and New Hampshire at a time when they were going to start paying attention to this race,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he emphasized. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Twelve candidates have qualified for Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s showdown. Bullock, Bennet, and four other contenders in the still extremely large but shrinking field of Democratic White House hopefuls failed to make the cut. Most of the lower-tier candidates have fired away for months at the DNC for their debate criteria, arguing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfair and winnows the field of candidates before voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the first four states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar, get to cast their ballots. A slightly more diplomatic Bullock said on Thursday that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe DNC was well-intentioned but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the best example is for campaigns to be spending $50 or $60 to get each individual donor\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best way to pick a candidate or nominee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pushing back against the criticism, DNC Chair Tom Perez told Fox News last month that the process has been \u00e2\u0080\u009ceminently fair\u00e2\u0080\u009d and added \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going \u00e2\u0080\u009cto continue to be transparent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rep. Tulsi Gabbard \u00c2\u00a0- who failed to qualify for last month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate but made the stage for next week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s showdown -\u00c2\u00a0announced on Thursday that she may boycott next Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate. GABBARD THREATENS TO BOYCOTT DEBATE TO PROTEST DNC The congresswoman from Hawaii accused\u00c2\u00a0the DNC and its\u00c2\u00a0national media debate partners of \u00e2\u0080\u009crigging\u00e2\u0080\u009d the primary battle against many of the lower-tier candidates and political outsiders running for the nomination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort to rig 2020 primary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she tweeted. Even though he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not making the stage, Bullock says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marching on. He told Fox News he has enough campaign cash to survive until the first votes in the early voting states in February. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still 120 days out from any voter expressing preference. I still think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of time for this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stressed. And Bennet took aim at the top-tier contenders for the nomination, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the support for the leaders in the race is very, very soft, maybe as soft as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever been at this stage of the race,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he predicted.",

In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work and his service as vice president. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback.

About half of political independents have done so. The lack of a Republican-Democratic difference in thought given to the election is notable because Republicans usually have an advantage over Democrats, including in each of the past seven final presidential pre-election surveys, as well as in most surveys conducted throughout presidential election years historically. The current results are based on combined data from interviews with more than 2,400 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, conducted between Aug. 15 and Sept. 30, 2019. Gallup has measured thought given to the election since 1952, and it has shown a relationship to actual voter turnout among all Americans in past elections.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: CLOAK AND DAGGER\u00c2\u00a0\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever nature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are sometimes requisite.

She said she was told by an official that there was a \u00e2\u0080\u0098concerted campaign against me\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and that Trump had pressured officials to remove her for almost a year. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Yovanovitch wrote in the statement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nReport: Trump pushed Tillerson to help a Giuliani client -\u00c2\u00a0WaPo:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Trump sought to enlist then-Secretary of State\u00c2\u00a0Rex Tillerson\u00c2\u00a0in the fall of 2017 to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani to help stop the prosecution of a Turkish Iranian gold trader represented by the former New York mayor, according to people with knowledge of the request. Trump urged Tillerson in an Oval Office meeting to try to craft a diplomatic \u00e2\u0080\u0098deal\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to stop the U.S. case against\u00c2\u00a0Reza Zarrab\u00c2\u00a0on corruption charges in exchange for concessions from Turkey. The request shocked the then-secretary of state, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the president. At the time, Turkish President\u00c2\u00a0Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00c2\u00a0was personally lobbying Trump to get the charges dropped.

Mr. Sessions, who served 11 terms in Congress until he was swept out last year, is described as \u00e2\u0080\u0098Congressman-1\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the indictment of\u00c2\u00a0Lev Parnas\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Igor Fruman, who were arrested and charged on Thursday with illegally funneling foreign money to American political candidates and campaigns.

Mr. Sessions is not named in the indictment, nor is he accused of any wrongdoing. On Thursday, he issued a statement that denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by federal prosecutors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nContinetti: We are all Ukrainians -\u00c2\u00a0Free Beacon:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom Varsity Blues to Jeffrey Epstein, from China and the NBA to Ukraine and Hunter Biden, Americans are taking a crash course on the ways in which powerful people manipulate the system for personal advantage and globalization merges political cultures as well as economies.

Trey Gowdy amid a widening impeachment inquiry is drawing criticism from one of his high-profile supporters. On Wednesday morning, the day after news leaked that Gowdy was set to serve as outside counsel to the president,\u00c2\u00a0Victoria Toensing, a veteran Washington lawyer who has been working with Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, expressed concern and disbelief that the onetime advocate for congressional oversight would be coming onboard.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0098Trey Gowdy doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know s***,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u0098He screwed up the Benghazi hearings, and he came out with the advice to Trump, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done nothing wrong, just talk to\u00c2\u00a0Bob Mueller.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Toensing and her husband,\u00c2\u00a0Joe diGenova, work with Giuliani though they are not officially on Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal team.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even join until January -\u00c2\u00a0WashEx:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cFormer Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy\u00c2\u00a0cannot join President Trump's legal team until early next year, the president announced Thursday.

President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill have hammered Speaker\u00c2\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00c2\u00a0for not holding a vote authorizing the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment proceedings \u00e2\u0080\u0094 arguing that without a vote, the entire process is illegitimate.\u00c2\u00a0Pelosi has refused to cave, dismissing Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demand last week and insisting it is not required under the Constitution or House rules. And allies close to the speaker say her position hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed, describing the idea as the latest \u00e2\u0080\u0098Republican canard\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in a series of stall tactics the GOP will employ to protect Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yet some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, to a lesser extent, publicly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point. The debate is threatening to cleave Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unified front as the White House makes the arcane procedural arguments the centerpiece of its impeachment defense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHouse members get an earful from voters back home -\u00c2\u00a0Politico:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe \u00e2\u0080\u0098Make America Great Again\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hats were in the front row Thursday night at freshman Rep.\u00c2\u00a0Anthony Brindisi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first town hall event since Speaker Nancy Pelosi blessed an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. But for all the criticism the centrist Democrat faced from pro-Trump voters, the sharper questions came from his own supporters about why he is one of just seven in his caucus who has refused to endorse the impeachment push. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Swing-district Democrats doggedly avoided the impeachment debate when they first got to Washington. Now they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t avoid it. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But at dozens of town halls over the two-week recess, Brindisi and other vulnerable freshmen had to fend for themselves \u00e2\u0080\u0094 serving as the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on-the-ground voices on impeachment. Whether they can deliver a message that resonates could determine Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 chances of winning over the public and holding on to their seats and the House majority in 2020.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIndependents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 support for impeachment jumps 10 points -\u00c2\u00a0NPR:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cA slim majority of Americans now approve of the Democratic House-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Fifty-two percent say they approve of the inquiry, while 43% disapprove. That's a slight increase in support from two weeks ago, when 49% approved and 46% disapproved. The numbers are in line with other polls that have been released this week also showing majority support or an increase in support for the inquiry. The uptick in support in the NPR poll comes mostly from a swing among independents. In late September, more independents disapproved of the inquiry than approved, by a 50-44% margin. Now, in a reversal, more independents approve of the inquiry than disapprove, by a 54-41% margin, a net change of 19 points. On the questions of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, Americans are split \u00e2\u0080\u0094 49-47% in favor of impeachment and 48-48% on whether the Senate should vote to remove him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nROMNEY STEPS UP HIS ROLE FOR GOP\nPolitico:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Donald Trump wants to sideline\u00c2\u00a0Mitt Romney\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 but the Utah senator isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t having it.

All are establishment-aligned figures confronting tough races in swing states. Behind the scenes, Romney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team has also begun directing his donors to help GOP candidates in Senate battlegrounds. Romney aides say he's always intended to help in competitive Senate races and that his desire to do so has never been influenced by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to ostracize him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDems eye Chelsea Clinton for New York House seat -\u00c2\u00a0NYT:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cMs. [Nita]\u00c2\u00a0Lowey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement set off a wave of speculation about other potential contenders, including\u00c2\u00a0Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President\u00c2\u00a0Bill Clinton\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Hillary Clinton, as well as a state assemblyman,\u00c2\u00a0David Buchwald.

I understand the following: Trump has proclaimed that he is pulling troops from Syria after what has been a long involvement (partnering) with the Kurds. But, that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen overnight, right? Once Trump announced the pulling of troops, Turkey is waiting on the sideline frothing at the chance to attack. They then attack, even with threats from Trump that they better not or there will once again be sanctions. Now the number of Kurds killed are rolling in, but are our troops still there? If they are, what are they doing? Is there something that Trump picked up on that is going on with the Kurds? The conspiracist side of me thinks he sniffed something out. My husband is an Iowa farmer and I work in crop insurance. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have many ties to the military but sure understand how government a lot of the time just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense. Any insight would be appreciated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0E\u00e2\u0080\u0099Lise Bracker, Underwood, Iowa\n\n\n[Ed. note: No conspiracy here, Ms. Bracker. The number of U.S. troops in the disputed area was very small \u00e2\u0080\u0093 measured in dozens. They were not a credible threat in terms of actually combating Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forces but rather something of a marker. By having the troops there, we were telling the Turks to stay out and leave our Kurdish allies alone. It was a small-scale version of the U.S. forces in South Korea: To fight, the Turks would have had to kill Americans, thereby bring our military down on their heads. Upon the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order, the U.S. troops were quickly out of the Turks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 zone of aggression. The Americans went to Iraq and other U.S. spots in the region, clearing the way for the Turks to start pummeling their ancient Kurdish enemies.]\u00c2\u00a0\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a huge fan of the Halftime Report and never miss it! Your struggle to remain fairly balanced is appreciated, especially by this reader who also struggles mightily to find truth and facts amid the bias and innuendo currently being passed off as \u00e2\u0080\u0098news.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2\u00a0 But I am confused by most of the polls' questions (especially the polls you quote) that seem to ask a compound question: Do you favor impeachment and removal of President Trump? I was under the impression that these are two distinct question.\u00c2\u00a0 That impeachment is like a grand jury investigation, i.e. a procedure (in the House) designed to decide whether there are grounds for a trial (by the Senate) to decide if removal is warranted or not. Am I wrong?\u00c2\u00a0 Please explain!\u00c2\u00a0 And keep up the good work!!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Tom Scherer, Udon Thani, Thailand\n\n\n[Ed. note: This is an excellent question, Mr. Scherer! Different pollsters do indeed ask these questions in different ways. The complexity of the situation is partly to blame. An \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeachment inquiry\u00e2\u0080\u009d is not a thing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a couple being \u00e2\u0080\u009cpre-engaged.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But some pollsters have been asking about it, which tends to screw things up. Getting respondents to differentiate between an \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeachment inquiry\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeachment\u00e2\u0080\u009d is quite a lot of hair-splitting for civilians. Our poll does it the right way (obvi) and asks whether voters support impeachment, impeachment and removal or no impeachment. Those are the three constitutional possibilities. In\u00c2\u00a0our poll, 4 percent of respondents said they wanted the president impeached but not removed. That adds up to 55 percent favoring impeachment and 51 percent favoring removal.]\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll my teams have long gone home for the winter.

The Police Department in Springfield, Mo., posted photos of the flags in use on its Facebook page Wednesday. The flags contain messages such as, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is this your turd? \u00e2\u0080\u0098Cuz that's absurd\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098This is a nudge to pick up the fudge.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The campaign started this week and the department noted on Facebook that leaving behind a pet's mess in many cases violates a city ordinance. The city's Environmental Services said the flags are made of bamboo and recycled paper and downtown crews will pick them up if they have to clean up pet waste.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whole debate arouses dismay, and not just because of the overreaching claims of both sides.

The country's highest diplomat told the American Association of Christian Counselors in Nashville, Tenn. he wished the NBA would call foul on China's human rights abuses. MAN WHO HAD PRO-HONG KONG SIGN CONFISCATED AT NBA GAME IN WASHINGTON SAYS LEAGUE IS 'AFRAID' OF CHINA \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Chinese Communist Party is detaining and abusing more than 1\u00c2\u00a0million Uighur Muslims in internment camps in the Xinjiang region of China. The pages of George Orwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1984 are coming to life there. I wish the NBA would acknowledge that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pompeo said Friday. The NBA's starts and coaches have been uncomfortable, unwilling or unable to discuss the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and\u00c2\u00a0mainland China's human rights abuses, and now the league is shutting down discussion altogether. STEVE KERR SAYS HE HASN'T BEEN ASKED ABOUT US 'HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES' WHEN ASKED ABOUT CHINA The league announced Friday it will not hold any media availability for the rest of its Chinese\u00c2\u00a0jaunt, a day after Beijing prohibited any kind of news conference before or after a preseason exhibition game between the\u00c2\u00a0Los Angeles Lakers\u00c2\u00a0and the\u00c2\u00a0Brooklyn Nets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have decided not to hold media availability for our teams for the remainder of our trip in China,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the league said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have been placed into a complicated and unprecedented situation while abroad and we believe it would be unfair to ask them to address these matters in real-time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The NBA made the decision independent of the Chinese government,\u00c2\u00a0ESPN\u00c2\u00a0reported. ANDREW YANG RIPS CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S 'RIDICULOUS' DECISION NOT TO BROADCAST NBA GAMES The tension between the league and China started earlier this week after Houston Rockets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 general manager Daryl Morey tweeted from his personal account a pro-Hong Kong message ahead of the Rockets'\u00c2\u00a0own preseason trip to Japan. The NBA has tried to do damage control but instead has only caused more outrage by appearing to abandon western values to placate China. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM The league took more heat Thursday after a Rockets official shut down a CNN reporter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question --about the fallout from the tweet --to stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook. The league later apologized for the incident. Speaking on religious freedom, Pompeo also mentioned that more than 80 percent of the world lives in areas where religious freedom is suppressed or denied entirely.

      "content": " Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., became the latest high-ranking target\u00c2\u00a0of two notorious Russian pranksters who have been fooling politicians into thinking they're foreign officials. Alexey Stolyarov and Vladimir Kuznetsov, two radio hosts who also pranked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in 2018, managed to reach\u00c2\u00a0Graham by phone and successfully impersonate Turkey's defense minister. Graham relayed President Trump's diplomatic interests offered to the senator during a private conversation between the two. None of the information appeared to be sensitive enough to raise concerns. Audio of the call, first released by Politico, showed\u00c2\u00a0Graham repeatedly assuring the pranksters of Trump's interest in military and economic cooperation with Turkey -- specifically mentioning efforts towards\u00c2\u00a0a free trade agreement and restoring Turkey's position in a joint airstrike fighter program. \"The president told me to tell President Erdogan that he wants to turn the discussion to a free trade agreement,\" Graham said at one point during the conversation.\u00c2\u00a0He proceeded to offer to arrange a call between the two leaders about trade, something he hoped would strengthen relations as the threat of U.S. sanctions loomed over Turkey's decision to install a Russian missile defense system. TURKEY'S SYRIA ASSAULT TRIGGERS WAR WITHIN GOP, AS TRUMP BATTLES NEOCON WING Fox News was able to confirm the call with Graham's office. \"We have been successful in stopping many efforts to prank Senator Graham and the office, but this one slipped through the cracks,\" Kevin Bishop, Graham's communications director, said in a statement provided to Fox News. \"They got him.\" Graham serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has become a key figure in working the president on foreign policy. Initially opposed to Trump\u00c2\u00a0in 2016, Graham has become an outspoken supporter of Trump's approach to Israel and North Korea.\u00c2\u00a0 That August call came shortly before Trump caused an apparent rift with Graham by deciding to pull U.S. troops out of Syria\u00c2\u00a0in October. Graham and other Republicans have criticized that decision as a permission slip\u00c2\u00a0for Turkey to enter the war-torn nation and slaughter Kurdish allies with impunity. Despite their disagreement, Graham continued defending Trump against House Democrats accusing him of pressuring Ukraine's government to interfere in a foreign election. Trump aides have countered by suggesting that Schiff -- one of the chief Democrats pursuing the House's impeachment inquiry -- was willing to influence the 2020 election during a separate call with Russian pranksters. In a\u00c2\u00a0clip posted by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Schiff\u00c2\u00a0told\u00c2\u00a0the Russian pranksters\u00c2\u00a0that he would be willing to accept dirt on Trump from Ukraine. Stolyarov and Kuznetsov had posed as Andriy Parubiy, the former speaker of\u00c2\u00a0Ukraine's parliament, while offering recordings of a Russian journalist and Russian model discussing compromising information about Trump. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Schiff and Graham weren't the only politicians to get tricked into believing they were talking to prominent politicians. The president himself spoke to comedian John Melendez, apparently thinking he was speaking with Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J. \"I find it astounding that the news media's not picking up the fact that I totally duped the president & got in touch... within in less than 2 hours while he was on Air Force One,\" Melendez tweeted in June of 2018.",

      "content": " Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told lawmakers behind closed doors Friday that she was recalled earlier this year after \u00e2\u0080\u009cunfounded and false claims\u00e2\u0080\u009d against her, as well as continued pressure from President Trump on the State Department to remove her -- as she denied being \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisloyal\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough I understand that I served at the pleasure of the President, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a scathing account of the way she was removed from her post. TOP DIPLOMATS TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS DESPITE OPPOSITION FROM STATE DEPT., WHITE HOUSE Yovanovitch, who was recalled in May, spoke as part of House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 impeachment inquiry into\u00c2\u00a0Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- in which Trump asked the premier to \u00e2\u0080\u009clook into\u00e2\u0080\u009d the allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct in the country. Trump, and his top attorney Rudy Giuliani, have focused on Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pressuring of Ukraine to fire in 2016 a top prosecutor who had been looking into Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings, on whose board Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son Hunter sat. The content of that call, revealed in a whistleblower complaint and a transcript also released by the White House, has led Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry into the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct. In that call, Trump described Yovanovitch as \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad news.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and other critics have accused her of working to undermine Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interests in the region.\u00c2\u00a0But in her prepared remarks, obtained by Fox News, she denied asking any Ukrainian official to refrain from investigating corruption, and said it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cfictitious\u00e2\u0080\u009d that she was disloyal to the president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard the allegation in the media that I supposedly told the Embassy team to ignore the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders \u00e2\u0080\u0098since he was going to be impeached.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 That allegation is false. I have never said such a thing, to my Embassy colleagues or to anyone else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. She also denies that the Obama administration asked her to harm the Trump campaign, or to help Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, and said that she has never met Hunter Biden. TWO GIULIANI ASSOCIATED LINKED TO UKRAINE INVESTIGATIONS INDICTED ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE CHARGES \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd although I have met former Vice President Joe Biden several times over the course of our many years in government, neither he nor the previous Administration ever, directly or indirectly, raised the issue of either Burisma or Hunter Biden with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. As for Giuliani, she said she was in contact with him three times as she can recall, none related to the controversy at hand -- and said that she did not know Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motives for going after her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut individuals who may have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. That remark appeared to refer to the two associates\u00c2\u00a0of Giuliani who have been linked to his investigations in Ukraine, and who were indicted for campaign finance violations after being stopped at Dulles International Airport in Virginia on Wednesday. Yovanovitch told lawmakers that she was told in April, just a month after her tour was extended a month before, to return \u00e2\u0080\u009con the next plane.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She then recalled a conversation with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who she says told her Trump had lost confidence in her after a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconcerted campaign\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that he had been pressuring the department to remove her\u00c2\u00a0since the summer of 2018. In her remarks, she said that the State Department had been attacked and hollowed out, and she predicted harm to the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interests. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe harm will come when private interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe harm will come when bad actors in countries beyond Ukraine see how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her statement revealed no new details about the circumstances surrounding Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with Zelensky about Biden. Trump has said he was investigating corruption, while Democrats have accused him of using U.S. military aid as a quid pro quo for an investigation into a political rival. On Friday, Democrats also accused the State Department of directing Yovanovitch not to appear before lawmakers.

      "content": " A federal judge on Friday blocked a Trump administration rule that sought to strengthen the ability of federal officials to deny green cards to immigrants deemed likely to rely on government assistance -- the latest defeat for the administration's aggressive immigration policy in the courts. Judge George B. Daniels issued a preliminary nationwide injunction, stopping the rule from taking effect on Oct. 15. New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who was part of the lawsuit, along with New York City and the states of Vermont and Connecticut, welcomed the decision. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BOOSTS ABILITY TO DENY GREEN CARDS TO IMMIGRANTS USING WELFARE PROGRAMS \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce again, the courts have thwarted the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to enact rules that violate both our laws and our values, sending a loud and clear message that they cannot rewrite our story to meet their agenda,\u00e2\u0080\u009d James said in a statement. \"This rule would have had devastating impacts on all New Yorkers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 citizens and noncitizens alike \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision is a critical step in our efforts to uphold the rule of law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublic charge\u00e2\u0080\u009d inadmissibility standard has long been part of U.S. immigration law, it had not been formally defined by\u00c2\u00a0statute. The rule, announced by U.S. Immigration and Citizenship Services in August, would have defined a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublic charge\u00e2\u0080\u009d as an immigrant who received one or\u00c2\u00a0more designated benefits for more than 12 months within a 36-month period. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe principle driving it is an old American value, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-sufficiency,\u00e2\u0080\u009d USCIS\u00c2\u00a0Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli told Fox News in an interview in August. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a core principle -- the American Dream itself -- and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the things that distinguishes us, and it's central to the legal history in the U.S. back into the 1800s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Those benefits that would be designated\u00c2\u00a0included\u00c2\u00a0Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), as well as most forms of Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),\u00c2\u00a0commonly known as food stamps. The rule expands the number of benefits that can be considered from interim guidance issued in 1999. ICE CHIEF WARNS COURT RULING BARRING DATABASE ACCESS ENDANGERS PUBLIC, RIPS 'JUDICIAL OVERREACH' But Judge Daniels'\u00c2\u00a0ruling said that the government had failed to provide a reasonable explanation for changing the definition of public charge. Daniels also objected to the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inclusion of English proficiency as a sign of self-sufficiency. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\"The United States of America has no official language. Many\u00c2\u00a0if not most, immigrants who arrived at these shores did not speak English,\" he wrote. He went on to claim that the definition has \u00e2\u0080\u009cno support in the history of U.S. immigration law\u00e2\u0080\u009d and described the rule as \"repugnant.\" \"The rule is simply a new agency policy of exclusion in search of justification. It is repugnant to the American Dream of the opportunity for prosperity and success through hard work and upward mobility,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. Cuccinelli responded to the ruling by predicting that the administration would ultimately prevail, arguing that \"an objective judiciary will see this rule lies squarely within long-held existing law.\" \"Longstanding federal law requires aliens to rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, sponsors, and private organizations in their communities to succeed,\" he said in a statement. \"The public charge regulation defines this law to ensure those seeking to come or stay in the U.S. can successfully support themselves financially and will not rely on public benefits as they seek opportunity here.\" CLICK HERE FOR\u00c2\u00a0 THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM The legal defeat is the latest in a series of setbacks for the administration on immigration policy -- where it has faced legal defeats on both legal and illegal immigration. Trump last week issued a presidential proclamation that would require immigrant visa applicants to prove that they have health insurance, or the financial means to cover reasonable health care costs. That proclamation, scheduled to go into effect Nov. 3, was also expected to be hit by a legal challenge. The moves by the administration\u00c2\u00a0have faced fierce opposition from immigrant activists, as well as many Democrats --\u00c2\u00a0who have opposed measures to limit welfare for immigrants, while also calling for the extension of various forms of government aid to illegal immigrants as well.

      "content": " LOS ANGELES --\u00c2\u00a0Many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are calling for sweeping affordable housing plans to address the chronic issue of homelessness, but advocates on the ground who see the issue up close say it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go far enough and they wish candidates would assign it more urgency. Homelessness in Los Angeles County and across Western states is skyrocketing. In 2019 so far, the number of homeless residents in Los Angeles has risen 12 percent from 2018, according to county statistics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need a FEMA-like, Red Cross-like, National Guard-like [solution],\" said\u00c2\u00a0Rev. Andy Bales, the CEO of L.A.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest homeless shelter, Union Rescue Mission. \"Army Corps of Engineers needs to come and we need to figure out immediately how to get 44,000 people off the streets.\" Candidate plans that are more forward-looking, like five to 10\u00c2\u00a0years down the road with millions of dollars in investment in affordable housing units, can be good in theory and are necessary, these advocates say, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t address \u00e2\u0080\u009cchronic\u00e2\u0080\u009d homelessness, or those who have lived out on the streets for six months or more in the past year. HOMELESS MAN RANDOMLY PICKS UP 6-YEAR-OLD, SLAMS HIM ON CONCRETE: REPORT \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing $600,000 to $700,000 per person, per unit, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planned over the next 10 years and that will not get it done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bales says. He added\u00c2\u00a0that only one candidate has reached out to him on how to remedy the situation. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary under President Obama Julian Castro and Beto O\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Rourke have actually visited homeless encampments on Skid Row, a notoriously expansive homeless encampment in downtown Los Angeles. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke released a plan this week similar to Castro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Sen.\u00c2\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 plans,\u00c2\u00a0saying he wants to triple funding for homeless assistance grants through HUD providing $50 billion over the next 10 years, fully funding housing choice vouchers, capping rent increases, and pumping investment in dilapidated public housing units. But for those who study the issue of homelessness, they say the problem should be coming up more in candidate rhetoric and dialogue as they campaign. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so much to just have a job to maintain housing, they say, because rent prices have become so unsustainable. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s becoming an intractable issue because we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the investment and broader solutions to homelessness, which is why I think many of the presidential candidates are focused on affordable housing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just emerging and most of the candidates have not yet addressed,\" said Christopher Herring, a UCLA PhD student. Herring said affordable housing is the main way to go, but there needs to be more steps done to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place and notes that with Castro and Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 plans, respectively, much of the dollar figures they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proposing will be spent quickly and frivolously unless backed up by creating and maintaining affordable housing quickly and cost-efficiently. \"To put it another way, that expansion of the billions of dollars for homelessness in Castro and Sanders plans will be pissed away quickly and a waste of taxpayer money if not backed up by more robust structural reform in the production and preservation of affordable housing.\" TOMI LAHREN: CA DEMOCRATS IGNORING HOMELESS 'EPIDEMIC' IN FAVOR OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PUSH California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic primary will be early in 2020, moving up to March from June, making the state in play again for candidates vying for the nomination with 500 delegates up for grabs. Voters in the state have homelessness high on their list of issues. Some in Los Angeles county say it even trumps traffic and the environment in what needs to be fixed first in the city. But ultimately, homeless people have very little, if any political power as a constituency, which could be why voters haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heard about the problem in states other than California. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the most part, the people who are experiencing homelessness are not voting, at least they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not voting en masse, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a strong political voice, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have political champions, and elected officials who are sensitive to what their constituents want or else they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get voted out of office, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a constituency they have to pay a lot of attention to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Adam Murray, executive director of LA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Inner City Law Center. California senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris is supporting a bill in the Senate to provide $13 billion in emergency relief to areas affected by chronic homelessness over the next five years. But Republicans are unlikely to bring it up for a vote, citing the huge price tag. Harris has blamed the Trump administration for cutting off funding to support what local government needs around affordable housing. President Trump, on the other hand, has spoken about the issue on Twitter and at his rallies numerous times, largely in irreverent tones. At a rally in Cincinnati in August, he said, \"What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country...It's a shame. The world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible conditions. Look at San Francisco, look at some of your other cities.\" Herring says California needs a federal response like what Trump is suggesting, saying, \"Trump has drawn attention to this and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s woken up the Democratic candidates to putting forward and putting pressure on them to make real solutions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati upheld a preliminary injunction saying that the law was invalid because it had the purpose and effect of preventing some women from obtaining pre-viability abortions, which violates\u00c2\u00a0Supreme Court precedents. Signed into law by then-Gov. John Kasich in 2017, the measure imposed\u00c2\u00a0criminal penalties on doctors who perform abortions after learning of a fetal\u00c2\u00a0diagnosis of Down syndrome. In February\u00c2\u00a02018, the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio filed suit to block the law from taking effect. One month later, U.S. District Court Judge Timothy S. Black halted the law, saying it violated a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to privacy. TRUMP TO NAME STATE DEPT. OFFICIAL JOHN SULLIVAN AS NEXT AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA On Friday the panel of three judges upheld Black\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruling in a 2-1 decision. A spokesman for Republican Attorney General Dave Yost said the state will ask the full 6th Circuit to review the case, according to Reuters. A large majority of the 6th Circuit court's members were appointed by Republican presidents, but Friday's majority consisted of Democratic appointees. \"The state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in preventing discrimination does not become compelling until viability,\" wrote Circuit Judge Bernice Bouie Donald, appointed by the Obama administration. Circuit Judge Alice Moore Batchelder, appointed by former President George H.W. Bush, dissented. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOhio concluded that permitting physicians to become witting accomplices to the deliberate targeting of Down syndrome babies would undermine the principle that the Down syndrome population is equal in value and dignity to the rest of Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population,\" Batchelder wrote, according to Cincinnati.com. BETO THREATENS TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF CHURCHES IF THEY DON'T SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE Batchelder, quoting a May opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, added that states have a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Under the law, doctors could have received up to\u00c2\u00a018 months in prison for performing abortions with the knowledge that the mother had based her decision in part on a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome.

      "content": " California\u00c2\u00a0Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed 15 gun-related bills into law Friday, tightening\u00c2\u00a0the state's already-stringent Second Amendment restrictions. One of the bills, which expands a so-called \"red flag\" law to allow co-workers, employers and educators to seek gun violence restraining orders against firearms owners they fear are a danger to themselves and others, was vetoed twice by Newsom's predecessor, Jerry Brown. Newsom also signed a companion bill allowing the gun violence restraining orders to last one and five years, although the gun owners could petition to end those restrictions earlier. The bill also allows\u00c2\u00a0judges to issue search warrants at the same time as they grant the orders. The warrants can be used immediately if the gun owners are served with the relinquishment orders but fail to turn over the firearms or ammunition. \"California has outperformed the rest of the nation, because of our gun safety laws, in reducing the gun murder rate substantially compared to the national reduction,\" Newsom said as he signed the measures surrounded by state lawmakers. \"No state does it as well or comprehensively as the state of California, and we still have a long way to go.\" Between 1993 and 2017, the latest available, there was a 62 percent\u00c2\u00a0decline in the gun murder rate in California, nearly double the 34 percent\u00c2\u00a0nationally, Newsom\u00c2\u00a0said. Co-workers who want to request a gun violence restraining order will have to\u00c2\u00a0have \"substantial and regular interactions\" with gun owners, and co-workers and school employees will need to get approval from their employers or school administrators before seeking a restraining order. Those seeking the orders will be required to file sworn statements detailing their reasons for doing so. BIDEN WANTS TO GIVE ASSAULT WEAPON OWNERS TWO OPTIONS: SELL YOUR GUNS TO THE FEDS OR REGISTER The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) opposed the bill, saying\u00c2\u00a0it \"poses a significant threat to civil liberties\" because a restraining order can be sought before a gun owner has an opportunity to dispute the request. Additionally, those\u00c2\u00a0making a request under the new law may \"lack the relationship or skills required to make an appropriate assessment,\" the ACLU said. The bill's author, Democratic Assemblyman Phil Ting of San Francisco,\u00c2\u00a0cited a recent study finding that gun restraining order laws may have helped prevent 21 mass shootings, though the University of California, Davis, researchers cautioned that \"it is impossible to know whether violence would have occurred.\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) and its state affiliate, the California Rifle and Pistol Association, opposed the new restrictions, according to the Los Angeles Times. The laws will take effect Jan. 1, 2020. GAVIN NEWSOM PREDICTS THE GOP WILL DEVELOP INTO A THIRD PARTY: 'THEY ARE FINISHED' The Democratic governor also signed a law that will limit Californians to purchasing one long rifle\u00c2\u00a0per month, according to The Sacramento Bee. This law expands the current legislation that applies to handguns, and it will prevent people under 21 from purchasing semi-automatic rifles and other similar firearms. The collective measures\u00c2\u00a0\"tweak\" the state's current laws and \"improve implementation,\" according to Amanda Wilcox, spokeswoman for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Ting also has a companion bill that would allow gun owners starting next September who are the subjects of restraining order requests to file a form with the court saying they won't contest the requests and are surrendering their firearms. Under current law, even those who agree to give up their guns must go through a court hearing, which Ting says wastes time and resources.

Newsom\u00c2\u00a0contrasted the progressive goals of his new law with restrictions recently enacted in other states. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs other states and the federal government go backward, restricting reproductive freedom, in California we are moving forward, expanding access and reaffirming a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right [to] choose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Newsom said, according to\u00c2\u00a0The Sacramento Bee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re removing barriers to reproductive health \u00e2\u0080\u0093 increasing access on college campuses and using technology to modernize how patients interact with providers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A number of states -- including Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Mississippi and Georgia\u00c2\u00a0-- have in recent months enacted such abortion restrictions as banning the procedure after six weeks, when a heartbeat has been detected.

Connie Leyva\u00c2\u00a0first crafted the legislation three years ago. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am thrilled that Governor Newsom rejected the misguided paths that other states have taken in limiting access to abortion care,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Leyva said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbortion is a protected right, and it is important that everyone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including college students \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have access to that right\u00c2\u00a0if they so choose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The law will rely on private donations, not state dollars, to pay for the services. The state hopes to raise more than $10 million. APPEALS COURT BLOCKS OHIO BAN ON DOWN SYNDROME ABORTIONS Abortion medication is available to women who are less than 10 weeks' pregnant and requires taking two pills. The first pill blocks the hormone progesterone. The second, taken days later at home, causes an effect similar to a miscarriage. All 34 of California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public colleges would be required to provide the services. Religious and conservative groups objected to the legislation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe oppose any effort to make it easier to abort a baby before he or she is born,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rudra Reddy, external vice president for the Berkeley College Republicans, told The Sacramento Bee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNewsom is opposed to the moratorium on the death penalty in California but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perfectly fine executing unborn children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \"Governor Newsom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reckless support for a new abortion pill distribution scheme on California college and university campuses will put students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives at risk and put schools at risk of lawsuits as conscience rights are violated,\" Students for Life of America president Kristan Hawkins said in a statement. \"The Pro-Life Generation will not sit back and watch their college and university campuses be turned into Planned Parenthood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new money-making machine.\" Republicans voted against the measure in committee hearings.

During the rally, the president launched into a mock interview with Hunter, Biden's son, whom Trump called \"not too smart.\" \"Hunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly. Hunter, you're a loser,\" Trump said, his voice rising. \"Your father was never considered smart, he was never considered a good senator -- he was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's a--.\" During Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call, Pelosi said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor him to say the thing that he said about Joe Biden last night was so far beyond the pale.\u00e2\u0080\u009d TRUMP BELITTLES BIDENS WITH GRAPHIC LANGUAGE AT MINNEAPOLIS RALLY She then turned her attention to the ongoing impeachment inquiry -- and how the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfacts\u00e2\u0080\u009d of that should not stop anyone from making some of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other behavior into an election issue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is about elections, and I will make my final point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we are doing on impeachment is about the facts -- \u00e2\u0080\u0098Just the facts, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am\u00e2\u0080\u0099 -- and the Constitution.\u00c2\u00a0 His policy, his personality, his potty mouth, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the election, and let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s make sure that we understand the reasons he is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the inquiry is because he has not honored his oath of office.\u00c2\u00a0 We will honor ours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pelosi then called Republicans in the Senate cowardly and said the impeachment inquiry is about saving the Constitution.

Trump administration officials called the letter, which was written by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and obtained by Fox News, perhaps the most historic letter the White House has sent. The document tees up a head-on collision with Democrats in Congress, who have fired off a slew of subpoenas in recent days concerning the president's alleged effort to get Ukraine to investigate political foe Joe Biden during a July phone call with Ukraine's leader.

The information was disclosed in response to queries from a federal judge in Washingon presiding over a related request by the House Judiciary Committee for the release of\u00c2\u00a0certain grand jury material, including redacted portions of Mueller's report. Chief Judge Beryl Howell on Tuesday had\u00c2\u00a0ordered the department to disclose said material from\u00c2\u00a0Mueller's\u00c2\u00a0Russia investigation\u00c2\u00a0into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.

The judge also ordered that the DOJ state by Friday whether Mueller's team had disclosed grand jury information when asking for help from other countries, saying she wanted\u00c2\u00a0to know if the department\u00c2\u00a0was withholding information from Congress that was already shared with foreign countries.

The court asked \"whether grand jury secrecy is the only basis for redaction for those parts of the Mueller report where grand jury secrecy redactions were applied and, if not, what other bases for withholding apply,\" court documents stated. MUELLER REJOINS WILMERHALE LAW FIRM, IN LATEST POST-RUSSIA PROBE LANDING \"In a limited number of instances, grand jury redactions in the Mueller report overlapped with other bases for withholding,\" which included \"personal privacy, deliberations with respect to charging decisions, protecting ongoing law enforcement matters and protecting information the disclosure of which would affect fair trial rights,\"\u00c2\u00a0the Justice Department said in its response.

A former senior DHS official with close ties to the administration told Fox News on Friday that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services acting Director Ken Cuccinelli\u00c2\u00a0is on the top of President Trump's list to be the\u00c2\u00a0next acting secretary. The source noted that a Senate confirmation hearing would be bruising for\u00c2\u00a0Cuccinelli but \"he, [White House adviser] Steve Miller and Trump are all in sync on a number of key policies. They have been trying to clear the way for a while.\" Former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach\u00c2\u00a0would likely be Trump's second\u00c2\u00a0choice, the official added.

MCALEENAN: NEW IMMIGRATION POLICIES KEY TO ADDRESSING BORDER CRISIS McAleenan called senior DHS leaders Friday night and said he was \"leaving because of family,\" a source familiar with the call told Fox News. The same source also said\u00c2\u00a0McAleenan has been \"on the outs with the White House, they didn't listen to him anymore, and he knew he wasn't going to get nominated\" as DHS secretary. McAleenan issued a statement Friday night following the president's announcement, thanking him for \"the opportunity to serve alongside the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security.\" \"With his [Trump's] support, over the last six months we have made tremendous progress mitigating the border security and humanitarian crisis we faced this year, by reducing unlawful crossings, partnering with governments in the region to counter human smugglers and [addressing] the causes of migration, and [deploying] additional border security resources,\" he said. McAleenan took over in April after Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen quit, and he was the fourth person to lead the department in two years. Trump hasn't named anyone to the job yet -- the acting deputy is David Pekoske, the head of the Transportation Security Administration. McAleenan, a longtime U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, was seen as a level head who could effectively manage the border crisis, but like many other former administration officials who came before, Trump eventually soured on him. The 240,000-person department is tasked with election security and cybersecurity, disaster response and even the Secret Service. But for Trump, the Department of Homeland Security means one thing: immigration. The president's signature issue makes the department his focus and his ire. Balancing a White House eager to push major changes with the reality on the ground is a constant challenge. On Monday, McAleenan was shouted off stage during a speaking engagement at Georgetown Law School by audience members protesting the\u00c2\u00a0Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0policies on immigration. He told \"Fox & Friends\" that \"part of the irony here is that this is supposed to be a group of immigration law experts who wanted to hear the facts of what's happening on the border. The facts of what's broken about our immigration system.\" \"I was going to challenge them on how we could talk and start a dialogue about how to fix it,\" McAleenan said. \"But, apparently [I] didn't get that opportunity.\" When it was clear that\u00c2\u00a0Georgetown Law Center\u00c2\u00a0was \"not going to change that direction of that dialogue,\" McAleenan realized it was \"time to go.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Law Center released a statement sharing McAleenan's regret and said: \"Georgetown is deeply committed to freedom of speech and expression.\" McAleenan had said the border crisis\u00c2\u00a0was at its \"breaking point\" during a visit to\u00c2\u00a0Texas in March, reiterating there were not enough agents to respond. Before serving in government, McAleenan practiced law in California. He attended Amherst College in Massachusetts and holds his law degree from the University of Chicago.

He cited mounting litigation costs that could otherwise go to families affected by the opioid crisis for halting the legal action, according to The New York Times. He pushed the parties to address concerns from opposing states. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are disappointed by the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruling, but pleased that it is limited in time to less than 30 days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said William Tong, the attorney general of Connecticut. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will use this time to ensure that we get access to the Sacklers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 financial information and will be ready on Nov. 6 to make our case to hold Purdue and the Sacklers accountable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Under the terms of the tentative settlement, the Sacklers would pay $3 billion to plaintiffs over seven years and would have to sell Mundipharma, their British pharmaceutical company and give up ownership of Purdue.\u00c2\u00a0Nearly two dozens state and hundreds of local municipalities have signed on. Another two dozen other states and other cities, counties and tribes have balked at the deal, saying the scale of the opioid crisis far exceeds anything being offered. Purdue has long been blamed for the opioid epidemic thanks to its aggressive drug marketing model and misleading federal regulators about OxyContin's risk of addiction, The Times said. SAN FRANCISCO SAW 150 PERCENT SPIKE IN FENTANYL-RELATED DEATHS LAST YEAR, REPORT SAYS At issue is how much the Sacklers should contribute for Purdue's role in the epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. The company has downplayed its part. Purdue has said it manufactured 4 percent of prescription drugs sold in the United States between 2013 and 2016 and that all were approved by the\u00c2\u00a0Food and Drug Administration, but also monitored by the Drug Enforcement Administration. Just before Friday's hearing,\u00c2\u00a0a committee of unsecured creditors that includes opioid crisis victims said it would support pausing the lawsuits. A deal with unsecured creditors calls for the Sacklers to provide financial information. \"We hope to be getting things that will help us decide whether we support the settlement,\" the committee's lawyer, Arik Preis, said in court Friday. DRUG COMPANIES SHIPPED THOUSANDS OF PAIN PILL ORDERS IT SHOULD HAVE HALTED, DOCUMENTS SAY Drain urged parties accusing the Sacklers\u00c2\u00a0of fraudulently transferring money from Purdue to resolve those lawsuits through\u00c2\u00a0negotiations in bankruptcy court because it could provide financial information from the family quicker than through separate litigation. In a statement, Purdue said it saw Friday's ruling as an\u00c2\u00a0\"essential next step in preserving Purdue's assets for the ultimate benefit of the American public. The company will work tirelessly and collaboratively during this pause in the litigation to continue to build support for the settlement structure.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A court filing made public in Massachusetts this year asserts that members of the Sackler family were paid more than $4 billion by Purdue from 2007 to 2018. Much of the family's fortune is believed to be held outside the U.S., which could complicate lawsuits against the family over opioids. In March, Purdue and members of the Sackler family reached a $270 million settlement with Oklahoma to avoid a trial on the toll of opioids there.

      "author": "Vandana Rambaran",
      "content": " President Trump slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., during a Friday night rally in Louisiana, saying\u00c2\u00a0\"Nancy Pelosi hates the United States of America.\" In his second rally in as many nights -- following Thursday's rally in Minneapolis -- Trump also ridiculed the ongoing impeachment inquiry spearheaded by House Democrats, whom\u00c2\u00a0he called \"scammers and con artists,\" \"They know they can't win an election,\" Trump told a\u00c2\u00a0packed arena in Lake Charles, La., \"so they're pursuing an illegal, unconstitutional bulls--- impeachment.\" The president's use of the barnyard epithet drew a roar from the crowd, just as a profane joke about former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden did a night earlier in Minnesota. On Friday, Pelosi described Trump's Obama-Biden crack as \"disgraceful,\" possibly prompting the president's Louisiana remark about the speaker. NANCY PELOSI SAYS TRUMP'S RALLY COMMENTS ABOUT BIDEN 'BEYOND THE PALE,' RIPS SENATE REPUBLICANS' 'COWARDICE' ON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY On Friday,\u00c2\u00a0Trump also attacked Biden\u00c2\u00a0and his son Hunter Biden over their\u00c2\u00a0Ukrainian business dealings\u00c2\u00a0for the second night in a row, accusing the media of covering up potential Biden corruption and complaining that if any of his children were similarly accused, the media wouldn't call the allegations unsubstantiated \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \"They would be saying, 'Where's the nearest cell?'\" The president decried the \"rage-filled\u00c2\u00a0Democrat Party that has gone completely insane\" accusing them of waging a \"nonstop battle\" to \"overthrow\" his presidency. Trump also mocked ex-FBI officials and lovers\u00c2\u00a0Peter Strzok and Lisa Page\u00c2\u00a0again saying \"these people are corrupt. These people are disgusting.\" \"This is the witch hunt,\" he said.\u00c2\u00a0\"They've been trying to stop us for three years with a lot of crap.\" Trump's appearance in\u00c2\u00a0Louisiana was scheduled to help rally\u00c2\u00a0Republican voters against the state's Democratic Gov.\u00c2\u00a0John Bel Edwards. \"Tomorrow you will head to the polls and vote to replace a liberal Democrat who has sold you out, John Bel Edwards, with a great Republican governor,\" Trump said in his remarks, encouraging Louisianians to get to the polls before Saturday night's big college football matchup between unbeaten Louisiana State University and the University of Florida or else they would feel guilty and \"it will ruin your entire afternoon.\" The president was\u00c2\u00a0joined onstage\u00c2\u00a0by both\u00c2\u00a0U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone, but did not endorse either candidate in order to\u00c2\u00a0maximize chances that Edwards will fall below the 50 percent\u00c2\u00a0vote threshold needed to avoid a runoff in Saturday's gubernatorial \"jungle primary,\" in which all the candidates appear on a single ballot. \"You're not allowed to hit your Republican opponent, you're only allowed to hit John Bel Edwards,\" Trump said, extending an olive branch between the two GOP candidates, who have been at loggerheads in the race to the governor's mansion. The president's trip to\u00c2\u00a0Louisiana\u00c2\u00a0came\u00c2\u00a0one day after another fiery rally in Minneapolis, during which Trump also slammed House Democrats and their\u00c2\u00a0impeachment inquiry against him. TRUMP BELITTLES BIDENS WITH GRAPHIC LANGUAGE AT MINNEAPOLIS RALLY, AS CHAOS UNFOLDS OUTSIDE ARENA The president touted the country's economy and boasted about the truce reached with China just hours before he landed in Louisiana, which stipulates that China will purchase up to $50 billion worth of agricultural goods from American farmers and also will\u00c2\u00a0postpone tariffs on Chinese goods that were originally set to take effect next week. \"I just made a great China deal today for energy, for the farmers, for the banks... I want to tell you, I got China to order a lot!\" He did not mention the\u00c2\u00a0growing issue of censorship in the U.S.\u00c2\u00a0over ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. \"We've ended the war on American energy, and with your help, right here in Louisiana, the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on the planet!\" Trump also boasted. He also slammed Edwards for the state's tax hike, which was passed with Republican support. \"You are going to fire your Democratic governor who has done a lousy job and send a great Republican\u00c2\u00a0to the governor's mansion,\" Trump said. Other top Republicans, including Vice President Pence and Donald Trump Jr., have paid visits to the\u00c2\u00a0state, which Trump won\u00c2\u00a0by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016. Neither Abraham nor Rispone has been able to break away as the top competitor, even as Rispone poured $11 million of his own personal wealth into the campaign.\u00c2\u00a0Party leaders' efforts to keep the men from fighting each other have failed, raising concerns the backbiting could wound both GOP contenders and help Edwards. Republicans blame attacks among their own candidates for helping to elect Edwards four years ago. Edwards isn't the type of liberal, anti-Trump Democrat with whom the president usually clashes. Louisiana's governor is an anti-abortion, pro-gun West Point graduate who avoids criticizing Trump, talks about his strong rapport with the White House and calls the impeachment inquiry a distraction for Washington. \"He's 100 percent going to drop the second Amendment ... John Bel Edwards\u00c2\u00a0will not protect your second amendment,\" Trump told the crowd. While Edwards' efforts to keep the president at bay in the governor's race have been unsuccessful, the Democratic incumbent isn't complaining about the rallies. Instead, he has downplayed them, calling it unsurprising that Trump backs members of his own party in the \"hyperpartisan\" environment of Washington. He said he would continue to \"work well\" with the president and focus on his own, bipartisan approach to governing. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \"When my opponents realized just how much support my campaign had from the people of Louisiana, they started calling in help from forces in Washington, D.C.,\" Edwards said. \"My opponents are obsessed with political partisanship because the only way they think they can win is to divide the state of Louisiana.\" Republicans nationally have targeted Edwards for ouster since his longshot election victory four years ago. But work to unify around one major contender failed, with the state's top-tier, well-known GOP officials passing on the race. Trump was also joined on stage by Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who said: \"I told you, Donald J. Trump loves Louisiana like the devil loves sin.\" He also invited the Eastbank All-Stars, the Little League baseball championship team that joined him at the White House earlier in the day and then flew on Air Force One to the rally, to come on stage in Louisiana.

      "content": " The pro-life group Students for Life of America (SLA) said Friday it would offer legal assistance to any students or health care workers whose \u00e2\u0080\u009cconscience rights\u00e2\u0080\u009d were threatened by a new California\u00c2\u00a0law that requires all public universities\u00c2\u00a0in the state to supply students with the \u00e2\u0080\u009cabortion pill\u00e2\u0080\u009d at on-campus clinics. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed the bill into law Friday. It\u00c2\u00a0requires all 34 campuses in the University of California and California State University systems to provide the abortion medication on-campus to women who are less than 10 weeks pregnant. It is to take effect in 2023 as long as a state commission can raise more than $10 million in private donations to pay for it. CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR SIGNS MEASURE REQUIRING UNIVERSITIES TO PROVIDE ABORTION MEDS \u00e2\u0080\u009cCalifornia just ensured women will die in their dormitory bathrooms, bleeding out alone from the abortion pill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d SLA President Kristan Hawkins wrote on Twitter,\u00c2\u00a0reacting to Newsom's action. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe #prolifegen will not stand for this. We will fight to protect the preborn and their mothers, as well as the conscience rights of campus health center workers. #sb24\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009c#SB24 in California forces all public colleges to assist with dangerous toilet bowl abortions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Students for Life also said on Twiiter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you are a student or employee who is worried how this affects your #consciencerights message us and we will assist you. The fight is not over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hawkins, who also heads Students for Life Action, continued her argument in a separate statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGovernor Newsom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reckless support for a new abortion pill distribution scheme on California college and university campuses will put students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives at risk and put schools at risk of lawsuits as conscience rights are violated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote. In addition to helping students and healthcare workers in California, Hawkins said her organization is looking into providing legal assistance to women in other states whose legislatures are considering similar bills. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStudent fees underwrite the costs of the healthcare centers on campuses, which will now be required to distribute deadly chemical abortion pills,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hawkins continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd healthcare professionals will also be forced to hand them out no matter the consequences to women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health, but Students for Life of America will make sure to connect these victims of conscience right violations with legal help to stop the spread of a bad idea that is only good for propping up abortion vendors like Planned Parenthood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Medication abortion involves taking two pills \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the first, taken at the clinic, blocks the hormone progesterone, while the second, taken days later at home without the supervision of a medical professional, produces a result similar to a miscarriage. The bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s author, state Sen. Connie Leyva, D-Chino, a\u00c2\u00a0 told the Associated Press: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbortion is a protected right, and it is important that everyone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including college students \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have access to that right, if they so choose.\" \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter three years of working to expand access to medication abortion at our public universities, I'm ecstatic that #SB24 was signed into law! Today, California stood on the right side of history by protecting and prioritizing the right to choose,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Levya also said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust because you have a constitutional right, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have access to that constitutional right, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really no right at all. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tired of women being shamed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Newsom, upon signing the bill, pointed to several Republican-led states, including Georgia, Kentucky and Mississippi, that have passed laws banning abortions at around six weeks into pregnancy once a fetal heartbeat is detected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs other states and the federal government go backward, restricting reproductive freedom, in California we are moving forward, expanding access and reaffirming a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right choose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Newsom said at news conference Friday, according to the Sacramento Bee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re removing barriers to reproductive health -- increasing access on college campuses and using technology to modernize how patients interact with providers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Former California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed a similar bill last year, arguing it was not necessary because abortion services were readily available off campus. Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco who became governor\u00c2\u00a0in January, said the law is needed \"as other states and the federal government go backward, restricting reproductive freedom.\" Other Religious and pro-life\u00c2\u00a0groups also opposed the bill. Live Action President Lila Rose said the law \"turns universities into abortion centers.\" Maria Jose Fernandez, legislative advocate for the California Catholic Conference, said the law is \"trying to limit the alternatives for women.\" \"We're giving them the option to terminate a life, but what about those who want to continue on with that pregnancy? Where is the help for those women?\" Fernandez told The Associated Press. Bishop Jaime Soto, president of the California Catholic Conference, implored Catholics and other Christians in an open letter to pray for the dissolution of SB 24 in order to shield \u00e2\u0080\u009cinfants and young college-age women from the scourge of abortion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Los Angeles Times reported. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM The state's Republicans voted against the measure in committee hearings. A handful of Assembly Democrats abstained during floor debates. The Department of Finance, under Newsom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, also opposed the bill, citing a lack of resources, personnel expertise and private funds to support a program of such \u00e2\u0080\u009csize, scope or content.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Also Friday, Newsom signed a law clarifying that Planned Parenthood can prescribe birth control via teleconference without a video chat, as it can in other states. Jodi Hicks, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, said the bill signings show \"that California understands reproductive health care is health care. And health care is a human right.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
