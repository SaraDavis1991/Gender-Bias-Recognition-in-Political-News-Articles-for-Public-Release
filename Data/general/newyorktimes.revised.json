      "content": "Just weeks after his inauguration, President Trump toured Boeing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s factory in North Charleston, S.C., holding a rally with workers, admiring a new 787 Dreamliner and calling on the company to bring down the cost of new Air Force One planes. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, in a case that the World Trade Organization is expected to decide next year, Europe accuses the United States of providing illegal subsidies to Boeing. A ruling against the United States could lead to tariffs against Boeing planes sold to European customers. Europe could also find ways to retaliate against the tariffs announced after last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruling. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Boeing victory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut one that may have unintended consequences that are not in Boeing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At issue was the substantial financial support that European countries have given to Airbus in the form of below-market-rate loans that are often forgiven. Without that support, the United States and Boeing argued, Airbus would never have been able to become a true rival to Boeing. With help from those loans, Airbus went from having less than 25 percent of the market share for large commercial airplanes in 1990 to overtaking Boeing in 2003. Today, Airbus and Boeing roughly split the market for commercial jets. Boeing hopes the new tariffs will reverse some of those gains. Airlines in the United States will now have to pay at least 10 percent more for Airbus jets coming from Europe, potentially steering more orders toward Boeing. And the European Union may be forced to reconsider its support for Airbus, with the tariffs in place until the two sides negotiate a settlement or the World Trade Organization decides that Europe is in compliance with its rules. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEurope is facing tariffs today because Airbus has refused for years to comply with W.T.O. rulings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Boeing said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnfortunately, Airbus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s noncompliance will negatively impact European member states, industries and businesses completely unrelated to Airbus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions, as well as Airbus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s airline customers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Airbus accepted the ruling, while calling for a settlement. Its chief executive, Guillaume Faury, said tariffs \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould be a barrier against free trade and would have a negative impact on not only the U.S. airlines but also U.S. jobs, suppliers and air travelers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Airlines expressed their displeasure with the ruling last week, and the stocks of American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines, the three domestic carriers that fly Boeing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Max, all fell as a result of the pending tariffs. Delta called them \u00e2\u0080\u009can unfair tax on U.S. consumers and companies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d JetBlue, which does not fly Boeing planes, said it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cconcerned about the detrimental impact aircraft tariffs will have\u00e2\u0080\u009d and argued they would \u00e2\u0080\u009charm customers who rely on us to offer competitive, low fares.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Other major airlines in the United States did not comment on the tariffs, preferring to avoid publicly criticizing Mr. Trump, yet were quietly fuming. The tariff package could have been worse for Europe and its customers. The Office of the United States Trade Representative said it planned to start by levying a 10 percent tariff on European aircraft and a 25 percent tariff on agricultural goods, including French wine and Spanish olive oil. Those taxes may be manageable for a time, but leave the United States room to increase pressure in the future. But Boeing wanted something from Mr. Trump, too. [Read how these new tariffs could make your dinner more expensive.] But no party got everything it wanted. Boeing had hoped the tariffs would tax airplane parts from Europe, a move that would have hurt Airbus, which opened a factory in Mobile, Ala., in 2015. In the end, the Trump administration declined to do so, believing that such a move might damage manufacturing in a pro-Trump state. Airlines, meanwhile, had been lobbying for the tariffs to be structured in a way that minimized their pain. Last week, a bipartisan group of 34 lawmakers sent a letter urging Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, to avoid levying tariffs and, if he did, to exempt existing aircraft orders. But the tariffs will hit existing orders. With more rulings from the World Trade Organization and the threat of European tariffs targeting American products looming, Boeing may not have long to savor its success. Yet in the midst of a trying year for the company, the decision was a welcome bit of good news. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe extent to which European member states went to create and sustain Airbus for the purpose of competing with Boeing, an iconic American company, is unprecedented,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Robert Novick, a partner at the law firm WilmerHale who represented Boeing in the case. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, the W.T.O. established that, and the level of harm it found to Boeing is unprecedented.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During a private conversation at the event, Boeing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, talked to Mr. Trump about a long-running trade dispute between the United States and the European Union that had its roots in the pitched rivalry between Boeing and Airbus, according to three people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a delicate matter. The case, which centered on subsidies that Europe provides Airbus, had been working its way through the World Trade Organization for years, but an end was finally in sight. In the event that it was settled on Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watch, Mr. Muilenburg urged the president to enforce the ruling, which would mean levying tariffs on European goods. On Wednesday, Boeing got its wish. After an announcement by the World Trade Organization, the Trump administration said it would tax as much as $7.5 billion of European exports annually. It was the largest-ever authorized retaliation in the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history, adding another layer of complexity to a global economy already rattled by brewing trade wars and further straining relations between the United States and the European Union. And it was the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boldest-ever step to protect Boeing, America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest manufacturing exporter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of those countries were ripping off the United States for many years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said Wednesday at a news conference with the president of Finland, a European Union member. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wise to it. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a lot of wins. This was a $7 billion win. Not bad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was also a win for Boeing, one decades in the making. Boeing has pursued its case against Airbus since the waning days of the Clinton administration, compiling evidence and finally persuading the United States to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization in 2004. Yet this is hardly a clean victory for Boeing. The company is in the midst of the biggest crisis of its 103-year history after the 737 Max was grounded because of two deadly crashes, and has infuriated many of its most important customers with its faltering response. Some of the customers affected by the Max grounding also buy Airbus planes and now face the prospect of higher costs as a result of the tariffs, adding to their frustrations with Boeing.",

      "content": "RHINEBECK, N.Y. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Even before Peter Plavchan Sr. asked about \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe exact crimes\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Trump had committed to prompt his congressman to reverse course and embrace an impeachment inquiry, Representative Antonio Delgado was ready with a detailed answer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are literally about to embark on something that has not happened all that often in our country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Delgado, Democrat of New York, told Mr. Plavchan and other constituents last week in his opening remarks at a town hall-style meeting in his district. Pressed further, his voice began growing hoarse as he explained, at length, the allegations about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pressure campaign on Ukraine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m endeavoring, in this space, to the best of my ability, to do whatever I can to not just fan the flame, but to figure out how to bring us through this process in a way that can very least help us emerge better for it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Delgado said. It is a difficult balance to strike, with Washington in a partisan frenzy over an impeachment inquiry that expands by the day as new revelations about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct pour out, but much of the nation is still divided over \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or simply uninterested in \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a process that could result in the removal of the president. Here in this politically competitive district in the Hudson Valley, which Mr. Delgado flipped last year to Democrat from Republican as part of his party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sweep to power in the House of Representatives, voters have yet to be consumed with the impeachment fever gripping the capital, and some are downright sick of the topic already. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAntonio, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite say you represent me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d declared Mr. Plavchan, who wore a red \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake America Great Again\u00e2\u0080\u009d hat and an American flag earring, from the front row of Mr. Delgado\u00e2\u0080\u0099s town hall-style meeting. More than 100 miles south on Staten Island, Representative Max Rose, another Democrat representing a conservative-leaning district, used a gathering last week with his constituents at a Jewish community center to declare his support for the impeachment inquiry. He was greeted with a hearty round of applause as he surrendered his status as one of his party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last holdouts. Across the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in Queens the following evening, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the progressive star who was one of her party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first and most zealous champions of impeaching Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 elicited chuckles last week when she informed her constituents gathered in a public library that, with a formal inquiry finally underway, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m over it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The conversations that unfolded in these Democratic town hall-style meetings, with a diverse group of three freshman lawmakers in three distinct enclaves of New York, reflected the broader dialogue happening across the country. Lawmakers, who are home in their districts for a two-week congressional recess, are confronting the delicate job of explaining their stances on the impeachment process, while still addressing voters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 more immediate concerns about issues like health care, climate change and infrastructure. From Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liberal urban stronghold to Mr. Delgado\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rural district, many voters appeared to be more interested in talking about regional issues than about high crimes and misdemeanors. And the lawmakers worked to make it clear that they, too, had more on their minds than the potential removal of Mr. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cImpeachment of this president is the short-term action that we need to take to preserve our democracy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said, preparing to show her audience a PowerPoint presentation on her latest policy initiative. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if we are really going to thrive as a country, we need to make long-term investments and keep our eyes on the prize of social, economic and racial justice in America.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When a New Jersey woman interrupted the event to question Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reasoning on impeachment, the freshman lawmaker calmly observed that \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou and I clearly have different takeaways,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and encouraged attendees to read the documents released by the White House and draw their own conclusions. But pressed on her public disagreements with other Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez assured those present that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin this moment, there is nothing that is going to shake the unity of the Democratic Party in impeaching the president of the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Party leaders had rebuffed calls to postpone congressional recess, arguing that even amid an avalanche of support for the inquiry, it was important for lawmakers to return home and explain their positions. The House Republican campaign arm heralded each event in moderate or conservative-leaning districts with an \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeachment advisory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a warning sign for Democrats who were already well aware of the risk of an impeachment backlash from their constituents. After Mr. Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement on Wednesday, a spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee deemed his backing for an impeachment investigation \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical suicide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Voters at each lawmaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event last week professed some knowledge of the impeachment obsession that has gripped Washington in recent days, and particularly at Mr. Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s town hall-style meeting, there was widespread curiosity about what had prompted a turnabout in favor of opening the inquiry. But the three lawmakers each faced more questions about their policy platforms and how they were going to maneuver legislation through a gridlocked Congress. Carol A. Oliva, a retired elementary schoolteacher who had been keeping track of which lawmakers had endorsed an impeachment inquiry, said it was no mystery to her why her congressman, Mr. Rose, had stayed silent for so long. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI kind of understand why \u00e2\u0080\u0094 politically, it may not be good for them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said before his public event last week. But when Mr. Rose stood onstage minutes later to offer a fiery endorsement of the inquiry, Ms. Oliva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tufts of sprayed pink hair could be visible among the dozen or so voters who leapt to their feet to show their appreciation. For Mr. Rose, there was only one critical outburst during his impeachment announcement \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from a New Jersey community organizer, who brought pamphlets from the pro-Trump LaRouche PAC \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that was quickly hushed by the majority of the crowd. None of the questions selected and read aloud by the moderator addressed the impeachment inquiry, though Mr. Rose ended the event by noting that the reporters present were likely readying to ask about \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe big \u00e2\u0080\u0098i\u00e2\u0080\u0099 word.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad he said it, and that we were able to hear it in person, rather than read it tomorrow in the newspaper \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just, you feel like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re part of something,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sharon Weerth, 70, a retired school secretary, standing outside Mr. Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s town hall-style meeting. But most of the questions, Ms. Weerth noted, were about \u00e2\u0080\u009cquality-of-life issues\" about their \"forgotten borough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d stymied by tolls and a lengthy commute into the city. That was also the case for Mr. Delgado, who fielded only one impeachment question \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from Mr. Plavchan \u00e2\u0080\u0094 during his 70-minute town hall-style meeting in New York last week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are so many issues besides the Trump issue \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is certainly a major issue \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but there are so many other issues that I want to get his feelings about,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Roberta Brodie, who attended, said of Mr. Delgado, her congressman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to see Congress \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the House and the Senate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 do their jobs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "title": "New York City Wants to Put a Climate Change \u00e2\u0080\u0098Laboratory\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on Governors Island",
      "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/06/climate/governors-island-climate-change-new-york.html",
      "subtitle": "The island, which has an unusual history and considerable real estate potential, could host a complex devoted to climate policy under the plan, which is in its early stages.",
      "author": "Christopher Flavelle",
      "content": "Governors Island, a 172-acre patch of land near southern Manhattan that is vaguely shaped like an ice cream cone, has been many things over time: An outpost of the Dutch West India Company, a Civil War prison for Confederate soldiers, a Coast Guard command center, and even a meeting place for President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev near the end of the Cold War. Since 2003, however, when the federal government turned control over to New York City, under the condition that it not be used for residential housing, it has been an island in search of a purpose \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and in search of a source of revenue to pay for its upkeep. Now, the city has a new idea: transforming one of its last big chunks of developable land \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as much as 4.2 million square feet on the southern half of the island, which New York wants to rezone for commercial and educational use \u00e2\u0080\u0094 into a \u00e2\u0080\u009cliving laboratory\u00e2\u0080\u009d for coping with the effects of climate change. The plan, which is still in its early stages, calls for making Governors Island \u00e2\u0080\u009ca major center for climate adaptation research, commercialization, conversation and policymaking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to a request for proposals that the city sent to contractors and that was reviewed by The New York Times. The document says the climate adaptation theme would be the \u00e2\u0080\u009canchor\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development. The proposal is the latest example of local governments taking the lead on climate policy as the Trump administration pulls back. But it also reflects the dilemma that global warming represents for New York and other fast-growing coastal cities: Even as seas rise and storms intensify, so does the demand for building along the water. On Governors Island, whose location in New York Harbor makes it particularly exposed to flooding and storm surge, that tension is part of the point, according to Michael Samuelian, who until June was head of the trust that runs the island. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing an island in the middle of a harbor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no better place to put the heart of climate adaptation and education,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Samuelian said. He said Governors Island, which is less than a mile from Wall Street, should become a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvisible representation of what these issues we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be confronting are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The city has asked outside consultants to come up with specifics about what that might look like, as well as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpitch deck\u00e2\u0080\u009d the city could use to sell the idea to foundations, universities or other possible partners. New York wants that work finished within six weeks, according to the document, so that it can solicit bids from developers by the end of next year. The goal is to make the island \u00e2\u0080\u009ca living laboratory in how you deal with these issues in an urban context,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alicia Glen, who was deputy mayor until earlier this year and is now head of the board of the Trust for Governors Island, which oversees the island. The project is also meant to pay for the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maintenance, Ms. Glen said, which is now funded from city coffers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reason why there are development opportunities on the island is to generate money that will allow it to be sustainable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Turning the island into a center for climate-adaptation research could also tap into New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concentration of workers in design, engineering, architecture and other related areas, while engaging the public on those risks, according to Clare Newman, who succeeded Mr. Samuelian as the trust\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a potential opportunity here to bring those strands together,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. The city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision for Governors Island echoes its technology-themed development of Roosevelt Island (which also abuts Manhattan), according to people familiar with the plan. In 2010, New York invited universities to compete for the chance to build a graduate center for applied sciences on Roosevelt Island; the winner was Cornell University, which in 2017 opened a campus there in partnership with the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. As for Governors Island, while a prudent approach might have been not to develop there at all, Mr. Samuelian said he saw more value in making the island an example of how development can coexist with rising water. That could hypothetically involve buildings elevated on stilts, or structures that could easily be dismantled and moved. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe city is a waterfront city, and our DNA is the water,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Samuelian said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ignore it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

It was Friday morning, May 12, 2017, three days after President Trump had summarily fired James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director. The conversation is described in a new book that portrays Mr. Rosenstein as anguished and isolated as he struggled with the realization that Mr. Trump might have ousted Mr. Comey to obstruct the F.B.I.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that he would probably have to appoint a special counsel to take over the inquiry, even if it cost him his job. The book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeep State: Trump, the F.B.I. and the Rule of Law\u00e2\u0080\u009d by James B. Stewart, provides new details about the history-making interactions between top Justice Department and F.B.I. officials immediately after the president ousted Mr. Comey. It recounts how Mr. Rosenstein was so troubled by Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior that he twice proposed that he secretly wear a wire and record the president in the White House, the second time in the presence of an F.B.I. official who took notes. Drawing heavily on reporting by The New York Times, Mr. Stewart, a Times reporter, also fleshes out how Mr. Rosenstein raised with Mr. McCabe the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment, which allows a vice president and a majority of cabinet members to remove an unfit president from office. In a new detail, he wrote that Mr. Rosenstein told Mr. McCabe during a May 16, 2017, meeting that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, would most likely support such a move. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt times he got up and walked around the table,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Stewart wrote of Mr. Rosenstein during the meeting in the deputy attorney general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt one point, he was so upset he went into an adjoining bathroom to compose himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That evening, Mr. Rosenstein revealed that Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Kelly to run both the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security as part of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrategy for disruption,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the book. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to be kidding,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. McCabe told him. For his part, Mr. Kelly was deeply disturbed by Mr. Comey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ouster. He called Mr. Comey as soon as he learned of it, saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009che felt sickened by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to fire him and wanted to quit in protest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the book said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to work for someone so dishonorable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Those reservations were apparently short-lived: Mr. Kelly went on to serve as Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief of staff for 17 months. The book does not resolve the mystery of how Mr. Rosenstein managed to hang onto his position after The Times, more than a year later, reported the gist of his conversations about the 25th Amendment and secretly recording the president. Mr. Rosenstein at the time publicly dismissed The Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s September 2018 article as \u00e2\u0080\u009cfactually incorrect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added in a statement, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBased on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite widespread speculation that the president would fire him, Mr. Rosenstein remained in his post until this May, overseeing the investigation by special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, through its conclusion. The book also offers new details about the F.B.I.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to open a counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Trump one week after he fired Mr. Comey. According to Mr. Stewart, the firing itself convinced Mr. McCabe and four other top F.B.I. officials that they had sufficient reason to open the inquiry into whether Mr. Trump had acted at Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behest. The decision was unanimous, according to the book. Mr. McCabe and another official were later fired from the bureau for unrelated reasons; the other three officials have also left. On May 17, the day after he met with Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. McCabe briefed the so-called Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of senior congressional leaders privy to major intelligence issues, about the decision. According to Mr. Stewart, only Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, asked a question. He wanted to know if the investigation was also a criminal inquiry; Mr. McCabe said criminal charges could result. Mr. Rosenstein, who also briefed the congressional leaders, appointed Mr. Mueller as the special counsel the same day. Before the president fired Mr. Comey, Mr. Rosenstein had written a memo suggesting that Mr. Comey should be dismissed. But it quickly became clear to him that his arguments for terminating Mr. Comey were entirely different from the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Mr. Rosenstein had argued that Mr. Comey made critical errors in handling the F.B.I.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of a private email server while she was the secretary of state. But when the White House tried to pressure Mr. Rosenstein to state publicly that firing Mr. Comey had been his idea, not the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 thus cloaking the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real motivation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mr. Rosenstein refused, with Mr. Sessions\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backing. He said he would not be part of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfalse story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Stewart wrote. In a broadcast interview two days after he fired Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump admitted that he acted because of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis Russia thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d not Mr. Rosenstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memo. According to the book, the sense that Mr. Trump had used him deeply unsettled Mr. Rosenstein, who had been in his post less than two weeks. Mr. Stewart described the May 12 meeting with Mr. McCabe in detail, saying that Mr. Rosenstein struggled to keep his emotions in check. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis voice was wavering, his eyes teared up. He said he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe what was happening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Mr. Stewart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no one here I can talk to about this. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no one I can trust,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rosenstein confided to Mr. McCabe, whom he knew only slightly. He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe one person I wish I could talk to is Jim Comey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "History has shown that foreign affairs can be treacherous for presidents, even just the suspicion of mixing politics with the national interest. As a candidate in 1968, Richard M. Nixon sought to forestall a Vietnam peace deal by President Lyndon B. Johnson just before the election. Associates of Mr. Reagan were accused of trying to delay the release of hostages by Iran when he was a candidate in 1980 for fear that it would aid President Jimmy Carter, but a bipartisan House investigation concluded that there was no merit to the charge. Mr. Clinton faced months of investigation over 1996 campaign contributions from Chinese interests tied to the Beijing government. In none of those cases did an incumbent president personally apply pressure to foreign powers to damage political opponents. Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president this summer to investigate involvement with Democrats in 2016 and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. while holding up $391 million in American aid. Mr. Trump has said he was simply investigating corruption, not trying to benefit himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe right way to look at it is the vice president was selling our country out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer, said in an interview on Sunday. Mr. Trump was fulfilling his duty, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see what the president did wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Giuliani has been leading Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to dig up evidence of corruption by the Democrats in Ukraine, meeting with various officials and negotiating a commitment by the newly installed government in Kiev to investigate conspiracy theories about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election and supposed conflicts of interest by Mr. Biden. Told that past White House chiefs of staff said any legitimate allegations should be handled by the Justice Department, not the president, Mr. Giuliani said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s if you can trust the Justice Department. My witnesses don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust the Justice Department, and they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust the F.B.I.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added that he would not have either until Attorney General William P. Barr took over. Mr. Barr has contacted foreign officials for help in investigating the origin of the special counsel investigation by Robert S. Mueller III into Russian interference and ties with Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, part of an effort to prove that the whole matter was a \u00e2\u0080\u009choax,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the president has insisted. Mr. Trump defends himself by saying that other presidents have leaned on foreign governments for help. That is true, but when other presidents have pressured counterparts and even held up American assistance to coerce cooperation, it has generally been to achieve certain policy goals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not to advance the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal or political agenda. As an example, Mr. Trump often cites Mr. Obama, who was overheard telling President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia in 2012 that he would have more \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore flexibility\u00e2\u0080\u009d to negotiate missile defense after the fall election. While that may be objectionable, it is not the same thing as asking a foreign government to intervene in an American election. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey assume everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as sleazy and dirty as they are, which is not the case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Emanuel said. Mr. Trump points to Mr. Biden, arguing that the former vice president was the one who abused his power by threatening to withhold $1 billion in American aid to Ukraine unless it fired its prosecutor general. Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, earning $50,000 a month. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oligarch owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, had been a subject of cases overseen by the prosecutor, and so Mr. Trump contends that Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ouster to benefit his son. As a matter of appearances, at least, the former vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family left him open to suspicion. Even some of his defenders say it was unseemly for Hunter Biden to seemingly trade on his family name. The elder Mr. Biden has said he never discussed his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business dealings in Ukraine with him, but some Democrats suggest he should have if only to prevent just such a situation from arising. For all of that, however, no evidence has emerged that Mr. Biden moved to push out the prosecutor to benefit his son. No memo or text message has become public linking the two. None of the American officials who were involved at the time have come forward alleging any connection. No whistle-blower has filed a complaint. In pressing for the prosecutor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ouster, Mr. Biden was carrying out Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy as developed by his national security team and coordinated with European allies and the International Monetary Fund, all of which considered the Ukrainian prosecutor to be deliberately overlooking corruption. Indeed, at the time Mr. Biden acted, there was no public evidence that the prosecutor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office was actively pursuing investigations of Burisma, although Mr. Zlochevsky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies say the prosecutor continued to use the threat of prosecution to try to solicit bribes from the oligarch and his team. The 1992 episode involving Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker provides an intriguing case study in the way previous administrations have viewed seeking political help overseas. At the time, Mr. Bush was trailing in the polls and eager for any weapon to turn things around. Representatives Robert K. Dornan, Duncan Hunter and Duke Cunningham of California and Sam Johnson of Texas urged the president to ask Russia and Britain for help. Mr. Dornan, reached last week, said Mr. Baker offered no objections during the meeting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBaker sat there in the Oval Office like a bump on a log,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe said nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If Mr. Baker advised Mr. Bush not to reach out to foreign governments, then he did so after the congressmen had left, Mr. Dornan said. Mr. Dornan said that was a mistake and that Mr. Bush should have done as Mr. Trump has. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bottom line from me was, \u00e2\u0080\u0098If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do this, Mr. President, leader of the free world, you will lose,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Dornan said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it and he lost. Baker cost Bush that second term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As it was, Mr. Baker and some of his aides got in trouble anyway because State Department employees searched Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passport file to determine whether he had ever tried to renounce his American citizenship. They found no such evidence, but an independent counsel was appointed to investigate whether the search violated any laws. The attorney general who requested the investigation? Mr. Barr, in his first tour running the Justice Department. The independent counsel who was appointed? Joseph diGenova, a lawyer now helping Mr. Giuliani look for information in Ukraine. In the passport case, Mr. diGenova concluded that no laws had been broken and that he should never have been appointed in first place. As for seeking help from Russia and Britain, Mr. Baker declined to comment last week, but his peers said he did exactly as they would have. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would have been ludicrous at that stage to do anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Skinner said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision was obviously the right one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 One day in October 1992, four Republican congressmen showed up in the Oval Office with an audacious recommendation. President George Bush was losing his re-election race, and they told him the only way to win was to hammer his challenger Bill Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patriotism for protesting the Vietnam War while in London and visiting Moscow as a young man. Mr. Bush was largely on board with that approach. But what came next crossed the line, as far as he and his team were concerned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey wanted us to contact the Russians or the British to seek information on Bill Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trip to Moscow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d James A. Baker III, Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s White House chief of staff, wrote in a memo later that day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said we absolutely could not do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Trump insists he and his attorney general did nothing wrong by seeking damaging information about his domestic opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and Britain or by publicly calling on China to investigate his most prominent Democratic challenger. But for every other White House in the modern era, Republican and Democratic, the idea of enlisting help from foreign powers for political advantage was seen as unwise and politically dangerous, if not unprincipled. A survey of 10 former White House chiefs of staff under Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama found that none recalled any circumstance under which the White House had solicited or accepted political help from other countries, and all said they would have considered the very idea out of bounds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI served three presidents in the White House and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember even hearing any speculation to consider asking for such action,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Andrew H. Card Jr., who ran the younger Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s White House and was the longest-serving chief of staff in the last six decades. William M. Daley, who served as commerce secretary under Mr. Clinton and chief of staff under Mr. Obama, said if someone had even proposed such an action, he probably would \u00e2\u0080\u009crecommend the person be escorted out of\u00e2\u0080\u009d the White House, then fired and reported to ethics officials. Other chiefs were just as definitive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid not happen on Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watch. Would not have happened on Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kenneth M. Duberstein, his last chief of staff. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have shut him down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Leon E. Panetta, who served as Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief of staff and Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense secretary. The sense of incredulity among White House veterans in recent days crossed party and ideological lines. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is unprecedented,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Samuel K. Skinner, who preceded Mr. Baker as chief of staff under Mr. Bush. Other chiefs who said they never encountered such a situation included Thomas F. McLarty III and John D. Podesta (Clinton) and Rahm Emanuel, Denis R. McDonough and Jacob J. Lew (Obama).",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 In a major shift in United States military policy in Syria, the White House said on Sunday that President Trump had given his endorsement for a Turkish military operation that would sweep away American-backed Kurdish forces near the border in Syria. Turkey considers the Kurdish forces to be a terrorist insurgency, and has long sought to end American support for the group. But the Kurdish fighters, which are part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., have been the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 most reliable partner in fighting the Islamic State in a strategic corner of northern Syria. [Related: Why Turkey is figthing the Kurds in Syria, explained.] Now, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision goes against the recommendations of top officials in the Pentagon and the State Department who have sought to keep a small troop presence in northeast Syria to continue operations against the Islamic State, or ISIS, and to act as a critical counterweight to Iran and Russia. Administration officials said that Mr. Trump spoke directly with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey on the issue on Sunday. And the officials indicated that the 100 to 150 United States military personnel deployed to that area would be pulled back in advance of any Turkish operation but that they would not be completely withdrawn from Syria. On Monday, witnesses in Syria saw United States forces withdrawing from two positions in northeastern Syria: observation posts in Tel Abyad and Ein Eissa. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the White House said in a statement released just before 11 p.m. in Washington. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u00e2\u0080\u0098Caliphate,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 will no longer be in the immediate area.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was unclear how extensive the Turkish operation would be, or whether Turkish forces would clash with the American-backed Kurds, a development that could jeopardize many of the counterterrorism gains achieved by the American military in the fight against ISIS. Last December, Mr. Trump called for a complete United States withdrawal from Syria, but ultimately reversed himself after a backlash from Pentagon, diplomatic and intelligence officials, as well as important allies in Europe and the Middle East. Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cErdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Empire: Turkey and the Politics of the Middle East,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said in a telephone interview that a Turkish incursion uncontested by the United States would allow Turkey to cut another swath into Kurdish-controlled territory in Syria. That would give Mr. Erdogan a ready place to send hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and prove yet again his influence with Mr. Trump on Syria policy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite a significant development,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cagaptay said. Many Syria experts criticized the White House decision and cautioned that American abandonment of its Kurdish allies could widen the eight-year Syrian conflict and prompt the Kurds to ally with the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad to combat the much larger and more technologically advanced Turkish army. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAllowing Turkey to move into northern Syria is one of the most destabilizing moves we can do in the Middle East,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Representative Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat and former Marine who served in the Iraq war, said on Twitter on Sunday night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Kurds will never trust America again. They will look for new alliances or independence to protect themselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The announcement by the White House came as a shock to the S.D.F., Kurdish officials said on Monday. In a statement, the S.D.F. said that it had fulfilled its obligations in the efforts to reduce tensions with the Turks but that the United States had not. The statement warned that a Turkish incursion could endanger the progress made to establish security in the wake of the battle against the Islamic State. It also called on Kurdish forces to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefend our homeland from the Turkish aggression.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Erdogan has demanded a \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe zone\u00e2\u0080\u009d for his nation to run 20 miles deep and 300 miles along the Turkish-Syrian border east of the Euphrates. That area, he has said, would be reserved for the return of at least a million Syrian refugees now inside Turkey. Mr. Erdogan has threatened to send a wave of Syrian migrants to Europe instead if the international community does not support the initiative to send them back to Syria. Since early August, the American and Turkish militaries have been working together on a series of confidence-building measures \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including joint reconnaissance flights and ground patrols \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in a 75-mile-long strip of that 300-mile border area. American-backed Kurdish forces have pulled back several miles and destroyed fortifications in that area. The pace of these operations has not been fast enough for Mr. Erdogan, and last week he began indicating that he planned to launch an incursion across the border. He did the same thing over the summer, prompting a flurry of American diplomatic activity bolstered by the military confidence-building measures. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both called their Turkish counterparts last week to try and reduce tensions. But unresolved threats from Turkey apparently resulted in the decision by Mr. Trump on Sunday. American officials contacted late Sunday would not say how far back from the Turkish border American troops would redeploy, or whether this signals the beginning of a larger overall withdrawal of the 1,000 American troops now in northeast Syria conducting and supporting counterterrorism operations. Those troops rely on their partnership with the S.D.F. which has 60,000 total fighters, including both Kurdish and Arab militias. One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a fluid military situation, said that American forces were pulling back from northeast Syria to \u00e2\u0080\u009cget out of the way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Officials described a military and political tension as the American military is pulled between two important allies in the civil war in Syria. Turkey is a major NATO ally, but the Kurdish S.D.F. forces have been a partner in the fight against ISIS. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not going to support the Turks and we are not going to support the S.D.F.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the official said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they go to combat, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to stay out of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There has been grave tension over Syria within the administration, as well. In late December 2018, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned over Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprise order of a full withdrawal of 2,000 American troops from Syria. Two days later, Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy for the coalition to defeat ISIS, also resigned. In the months afterward, American officials quietly worked behind the scenes to ensure that some level of troops would remain in northeast Syria. As recently as the week of the United Nations General Assembly summit in late September, senior American officials were saying there was consensus across the United States government, including Mr. Trump, on ensuring the welfare of the Kurdish forces and warding off Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s persistent desire to attack those forces. But around that same time, Turkish officials were privately saying that they saw things very differently: They said they perceived a sharp division between Mr. Trump and other American officials \u00e2\u0080\u0094 most notably generals in the United States Central Command, which oversees troops in the Middle East. While it was clear the generals wanted to bar Turkey from the safe zone and keep American troops there, Mr. Trump clearly wanted the troops out, they said, and in the end he might get his way. Mr. Erdogan had traveled to New York with the intention of talking about Syria and the Kurds with Mr. Trump in a private meeting. He attended a group dinner hosted by Mr. Trump, but the two did not have a formal meeting there. Mr. Trump did say at one event that Mr. Erdogan had \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecome a friend of mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The telephone call between the two on Sunday might have been organized as a substitute for the meeting that never took place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis looks to be another reckless decision made without deliberation or consultation following a call with a foreign leader,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. McGurk said after hearing of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision on Sunday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe White House statement bears no relation to facts on the ground. If implemented, it will significantly increase risk to our personnel, as well as hasten ISIS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resurgence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turkish officials pointed to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorable exchanges with Mr. Erdogan during the G20 summit meeting in Japan in June as another sign of a strong relationship between the two leaders. That bilateral meeting was more about a different security flash point between the United States and Turkey \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the purchase by Turkey of the Russian S-400 missile defense system. But Mr. Trump has largely brushed that issue aside. [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive more stories about the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military policy in Syria.] The White House statement on Sunday came as the Islamic State is gathering new strength, conducting guerrilla attacks across Iraq and Syria, retooling its financial networks and targeting new recruits at an allied-run tent camp, American military, counterterrorism and intelligence officers say. Though Mr. Trump hailed a total defeat of the Islamic State this year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and asserted its territorial demise in Sunday night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement \u00e2\u0080\u0094 defense officials in the region see things differently, acknowledging that what remains of the terrorist group is here to stay. Over the past several months, ISIS has made inroads into the sprawling Al Hol tent camp in northeast Syria, and there is no ready plan to deal with the 70,000 people there, including thousands of family members of ISIS fighters. American intelligence officials say the Al Hol camp, managed by Syrian Kurdish allies with little aid or security, is evolving into a hotbed of ISIS ideology. The American-backed Syrian Kurdish force also holds more than 10,000 ISIS fighters, including 2,000 foreigners, in separate makeshift prisons. The custody of all these people could be in jeopardy, American officials said Sunday night, depending on whether any Turkish incursion sets off a much larger conflict in northeast Syria.",

      "content": "ERIE, Pa. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mark Graham, a real estate appraiser in this faded manufacturing hub, sat with friends at a gym named FitnessU on the morning after the Democratic debate in mid-September. He had voted for Barack Obama, but in 2016 he took a gamble on Donald Trump. Although he called the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct in office \u00e2\u0080\u009ca joke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he was unwilling to commit to voting Democratic in 2020, unconvinced by the 10 party hopefuls the night before. Jump ahead to October and Democrats in Congress are investigating evidence of President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible abuse of power. Mr. Graham has had an electoral conversion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThings have changed in the last couple weeks: More stupidity has come out,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mr. Graham, 69, said in a telephone interview last week. He hopes Democrats nominate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., but he is not particular. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who it is at this point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Mr. Trump gets into another four years, where he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lame duck, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be like adding gasoline to the fire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [How did \u00e2\u0080\u0098never Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Republicans become some of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongest defenders?] Heading into 2020, there is intense focus among campaign strategists on the weakest element of the Trump coalition: the millions of voters who disapproved of both major candidates in 2016 but took a chance on Mr. Trump. Whether an impeachment inquiry moves Obama-Trump voters like Mr. Graham off the fence, one way or the other, is a major narrative arc in the 2020 script that is rapidly unfolding and updating. Erie County in western Pennsylvania holds a wealth of these conflicted voters. That much was clear in interviews conducted in the days after the 2016 election, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear now. Mr. Trump won an upset national victory by carrying places just like Erie County, long a blue-collar Democratic stronghold; he won here thanks to a 17-point swing from Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s margin of victory in 2012. The area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flip from blue to red was a microcosm of how Mr. Trump pulled off narrow victories in this state as well as in Michigan and Wisconsin. In interviews in Erie last month, before the impeachment inquiry began, many of the Trump voters from 2016 were either supportive of the president or unpersuaded by the Democratic alternatives. But reached by phone after the inquiry was announced, some of these voters had changed their minds. Outright conversions like Mr. Graham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, while still rare, were reflected in an uptick of support for impeachment by independent voters in recent national polls. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know which way the impeachment issue is going to cause public opinion to move,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joseph Morris, a political scientist at Mercyhurst University in Erie, who was polling local voters when news of the impeachment inquiry broke. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUndoubtedly a majority of voters that voted for Trump will vote for him again in 2020,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Morris said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I think the jury is still out when it comes to those independents or any Democrats who chose to vote for Trump in 2016.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Two strong predictors of a president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election odds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 support for his handling of the economy and voters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 overall approval \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are pulling in opposite directions in Mr. Morris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest survey of Erie County, which suggests a close election in this battleground county in a battleground state. Approval of Mr. Trump overall is dismal at 38 percent, but 52 percent approve of the way he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handling the economy. [Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.] Obama-Trump voters like Mr. Graham totaled some 6.7 million people in 2016, according to the results of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a large survey conducted before and after elections. Of the nearly one in five voters who disapproved of both major 2016 candidates, Mr. Trump won by a 17-point margin. Another large study of nearly 7,000 voters in January 2019 found that Obama-Trump voters were the only slice of the electorate whose approval of Mr. Trump has significantly eroded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven small movement among these voters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who represented 5 percent of voters in 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 may prove significant heading into the 2020 presidential election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote one of the election scholars behind the study. Mark Miller, the third-generation owner of Miller Brothers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lawn and garden supply store in Erie, is a longtime Republican who cast a grudging vote for Mr. Trump. We met last month for breakfast at Dominick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, the same 24-hour restaurant downtown where I interviewed him in 2016. Mr. Miller said at the time the likelihood he would vote Democratic in 2020 was \u00e2\u0080\u009c50-50.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he was still \u00e2\u0080\u009c50-50\u00e2\u0080\u009d when we spoke this month. Among the Democratic candidates he could potentially support, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey impressed him as a happy warrior on the campaign trail. He liked Mr. Biden because he was not promising the moon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI gave the other guy a shot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Miller said of the president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the way he talks to people. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing internally with the cabinet. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think anybody feels comfortable that we have anything cohesive at the top right now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A small-business owner with about 20 employees, Mr. Miller, 55, calls himself \u00e2\u0080\u009ca really conservative family guy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d who sent four children to Catholic schools. He was not ready in September to say he would vote Democratic, and the impeachment inquiry has not changed his mind. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTalking to people coming through the doors daily, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s information overload and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure what to believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said last week, speaking from his store after closing hours. He said it was wrong for the president to ask a foreign country, Ukraine, to investigate a political rival, Mr. Biden. But he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s egregious enough to warrant full impeachment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to see everybody get back to work on the business of the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lyne Daniels, a 52-year-old Obama-Trump voter in Erie, said congressional Democrats should be working with the president on issues like health care and immigration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing is, Get Trump, Get Trump, Get Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said of the impeachment inquiry. Ms. Daniels, who works both as a municipal secretary and for a clothing store, knows exactly who she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll vote for in 2020: Mr. Trump. She said the president had fulfilled his promises to put \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica First\u00e2\u0080\u009d by avoiding foreign wars and ending decades of what she called open borders. [Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfounded allegations about Biden and his son have been the biggest campaign challenge to the former vice president yet.] Ms. Daniels said she voted for Mr. Obama twice because he faced Republicans she disliked and regarded as members of the establishment. She called Senator John McCain, the 2008 nominee, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca traitor to this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done my own research.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even fans of Mr. Trump often say they wish he would lay off Twitter. Not Ms. Daniels, who called it a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrilliant\u00e2\u0080\u009d diversionary tactic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe plays you, the press, like a fiddle, and you fall for it every time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe gets everybody talking and it sucks up airtime for days. Meanwhile over in the corner, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on this thing nobody knows about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thousands of documented falsehoods in office, Ms. Daniels pushed back. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBased on whose sources?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she demanded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust because the news tells me that his claims are false is a little hypocritical because we had to listen about Russia, Russia, Russia for two years, and they were wrong. Who are they to say what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming out of his mouth is wrong?\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the 2018 midterms, Democrats did well in the three Pennsylvania counties that Mr. Trump had flipped: Erie, Luzerne and Northampton. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, carried all three. Ron DiNicola, a Democrat running for Congress, won Erie County by 20 points, though he lost the race because rural counties in the district voted Republican. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel like our country has been more divided than ever,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Stephanie Johnson, 38, a substitute teacher and registered Libertarian in Erie County. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see it just being a mom, being out and about, at the grocery store, after school. I feel like people are so angry nowadays.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Johnson worries that a decline in attendance at her family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s church is related to the divisiveness of America under Mr. Trump, whom she has no interest in voting for in 2020. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel like there are a lot of people who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t putting their full trust and faith in God, and are sort of scared and angry about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. A president with no self-restraint on how he speaks about others has spread coarseness, Ms. Johnson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just gotten to the point where nobody has any compassion for each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still, Ryan Bizzarro, a Democratic state representative from Erie County, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf this economy holds on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009cis going to be tough to beat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Republicans \u00e2\u0080\u009chave been able to hijack our narrative because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so focused on a lot of the social issues \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which are important, but people are voting again with their wallets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bizzarro said last month. Once a city reliant on heavy industry, Erie is moving past the stereotype of Rust Belt decrepitude. Its largest employer was once a General Electric plant making locomotives but is now Erie Insurance. Lost manufacturing jobs are being replaced by start-ups making computer and electronic parts. Mr. Bizzarro, 33, was skeptical that Mr. Biden would end up as the nominee. If Democrats nominate one of his two closest current rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mr. Bizzarro sounded leery of their ability to carry Erie County without a surge of voters from his own generation. Millennials, whose turnout continues to lag older voters, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdamn well better show up for the election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump threw Middle East policy into turmoil on Monday with a series of conflicting signals after his vow to withdraw American forces from the region touched off an uprising among congressional Republicans and protests by America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies. Defending his decision to clear the way for a Turkish military operation against America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kurdish allies in northern Syria, announced in a White House statement on Sunday night, Mr. Trump said it was \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime for us to get out\u00e2\u0080\u009d and let others \u00e2\u0080\u009cfigure the situation out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Related: Why Turkey is fighting Kurds in Syria, explained.] But his move touched off a broad rebuke by Republicans, including some of his staunchest allies, in some of the sharpest language they have leveled against a Trump foreign policy decision. And in response, the president pivoted sharply and said he would restrain Turkey. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done before!),\u00e2\u0080\u009d the president wrote on Twitter. He did not explain what would be off limits, but aides insisted he had not given a green light to an invasion. A Defense Department official said the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s threat to destroy the Turkish economy should make clear that Mr. Trump had not approved a Turkish attack on the Kurds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Department of Defense made clear to Turkey \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as did the president \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in northern Syria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jonathan Hoffman, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe U.S. armed forces will not support or be involved in any operation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Republicans were not sure. Even after Mr. Trump recalibrated his message, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, warned against \u00e2\u0080\u009ca precipitous withdrawal\u00e2\u0080\u009d that would benefit Russia, Iran, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and the Islamic State. Mr. McConnell sharply urged the president to \u00e2\u0080\u009cexercise American leadership.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pronouncements kept supporters, foreign leaders, military officers and his own aides off balance as they tried to interpret Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaning and anticipate its consequences. The president has long agitated to get the United States out of overseas wars, only to be pulled back by the national security establishment and congressional allies. In this case, Mr. Trump seemed to be responding instinctively to an unexpected comment by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey near the end of a telephone call on Sunday that otherwise focused on trade and defense assistance. Mr. Erdogan, who has long threatened to send troops over the border against Kurdish fighters allied with the United States, told Mr. Trump that he was finally moving forward. Mr. Trump told Mr. Erdogan that he did not support an incursion, according to aides. But rather than hold back Mr. Erdogan anymore, Mr. Trump got off the call and promptly issued a late-night statement that he would pull out about 50 American special operations troops near the border who have served as a trip wire deterring Turkey from sending forces into Syria. By Monday morning, he was bombarded with complaints from both Republicans and Democrats, who charged that such a move would abandon the Kurds, some of the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 most loyal and effective allies in the region, while emboldening some of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most threatening enemies. [A look at who is affected by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shift in Syria.] \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a big win for Iran and Assad, a big win for ISIS,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and usually one of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most vocal backers, said on Fox News. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will do everything I can to sanction Turkey if they step one foot in northeastern Syria. That will sever my relationship with Turkey. I think most of the Congress feels that way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Graham said he would also introduce a nonbinding resolution asking Mr. Trump to reconsider his move, which he called \u00e2\u0080\u009cshortsighted and irresponsible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assertion that the Islamic State has been defeated is \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe biggest lie being told by the administration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Graham added. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a member of the House Republican leadership, called withdrawing forces \u00e2\u0080\u009ca catastrophic mistake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said it would be \u00e2\u0080\u009ca grave mistake that will have implications far beyond Syria.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nikki R. Haley, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former ambassador to the United Nations, joined the chorus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she tweeted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Left virtually on his own, Mr. Trump found support on Capitol Hill from Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky and one of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staunchest defenders. The president \u00e2\u0080\u009conce again fulfills his promises to stop our endless wars and have a true America First foreign policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Paul tweeted. Mr. Trump came to office promising to get the country out of overseas wars, contending that the military\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks had largely been a waste of lives and money, with little to show for it. A similarly sudden decision last winter to pull American troops out of Syria prompted Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign, and Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, accelerated his own planned departure in protest. The Senate, led by Mr. McConnell, relayed its displeasure in January by voting overwhelmingly to rebuke Mr. Trump over his planned withdrawal of military forces from Syria and Afghanistan. Mr. Trump later walked back his decision in Syria to some extent, but has been frustrated to not be doing more to extricate the United States from entanglements in the region. His supporters said that the latest move should therefore not be a surprise and that the Kurds had fair warning. The Kurdish forces in the area, part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., have been the most reliable American allies in the region for years, a critical element in recapturing territory once controlled by the Islamic State. But Turkey has long considered the Kurdish fighters to be terrorists and has lobbied the United States to abandon support for them. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial messages on Monday morning focused not on holding back Turkey but on pulling back from the region. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN. Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He offered little sympathy for the fate of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kurdish allies: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Kurds fought with us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meeting with reporters later in the day, he recalled his promises to get out of Middle East wars. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI campaigned on the fact that I was going to bring our soldiers home and bring them home as quickly as possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. But even as Mr. Trump talked in global terms, administration officials stressed the limited nature of the current action. Special operations troops near the border will be relocated in coming days, but the total 1,000 troops in Syria would not immediately come home. Mr. Trump has been particularly irritated that the United States continues to pay to detain thousands of Islamic State fighters captured in recent years. For months, he has tried to pressure European states and others to take those fighters who originated from there, only to run into strong resistance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Take them back\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and unfortunately, like NATO, they take advantage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump told reporters. But if Turkey moves against the Kurds, the S.D.F. could abandon camps to fight the Turks, potentially allowing some 10,000 captured Islamic State fighters, including 2,000 foreigners, to escape. A senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under administration ground rules said Mr. Trump told Mr. Erdogan that if he did send in troops, they would be responsible for securing the prisoners. The United States has suspended longstanding efforts to create a safe zone in Syria near the Turkish border that would have kept Turkish forces and Syrian fighters at a distance from each other. But another administration official said that the United States was now controlling the air space over northeast Syria in part to prevent Turkish aggression. The prospect that an American withdrawal would lead to a Turkish incursion alarmed European allies. The French and Germans issued statements expressing deep concern. A State Department official said the international reaction to a possible Turkish operation had been \u00e2\u0080\u009cdevastating\u00e2\u0080\u009d and acknowledged it would destabilize the region. For now at least, the Syrian Defense Forces leadership has told American officials that it will continue to detain the Islamic State fighters and their families in makeshift camps in northern Syria. But a State Department official acknowledged that the best-trained guards could be pulled away in the event of conflict with Turkey. Most of the camps are farther south than where the Turkish forces have indicated they might go in Syria, outside the boundary of even the broadest safe zone that has been discussed. If the Kurdish guards flee advancing Turkish forces, the official said, then the administration expects the Turks to take over the detention centers. American counterterrorism specialists said on Monday that transferring counterterrorism responsibilities to a Turkish military force that has proved ill trained and ill equipped to conduct such operations in their own country would be disastrous and potentially reverse important victories by American troops and their Kurdish partners on the ground. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to imagine Turkey has the capacity to handle securely and appropriately the detainees long held by the Syrian Kurds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s if Turkey even genuinely intends to try,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joshua A. Geltzer, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council under Mr. Obama. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe release or escape of such detainees,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould instantly energize ISIS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts, already underway, to regroup and surge again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The escalating impeachment drama between Congress and the White House that has all but doomed hopes of most legislative progress this fall has instead enhanced the prospects for approval, within weeks, of one major initiative: a sweeping new trade agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico. [Here is what happened in the Trump impeachment inquiry today.] Top lawmakers in both parties and others closely following the talks said that substantial progress had been made in resolving the sticking points, and that a decisive House vote on the accord to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement could occur before Congress departed for Thanksgiving. The deal may be a rare bright spot in an otherwise dysfunctional dynamic that has taken hold in the capital, and it owes its progress to a coincidence of timing, productive negotiations that have unfolded behind closed doors for months and political necessity for two parties that each has distinct reasons to hope it succeeds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are on a path to yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters last week in one of the strongest signals yet that she would put the full weight of her leadership behind passage of the agreement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Both parties have strong political incentives to approve the trade deal despite deep Democratic skepticism over such pacts after American jobs flowed into Mexico after the ratification of NAFTA in 1993. For President Trump and Republicans, the agreement is a major priority that could bolster American businesses and help struggling farmers, while showing voters that they have been good stewards of the economy. For Democrats, the accord is a way to give lawmakers from swing districts a broadly popular achievement to show constituents, and a way to counter criticism that they have accomplished little during their time in Washington, which has more often consisted of passing legislation that dies in the Republican-controlled Senate. That has become even more important now that House Democrats are engaged in an impeachment inquiry that could lead to the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ouster. Democrats who represent Republican-leaning districts are facing a potential backlash from Republican and independent voters angry over the Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 emphasis on impeachment, and they are looking for ways to show that they can still produce policies that benefit Americans. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are going to demonstrate that simultaneously you can govern,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Representative Richard E. Neal, the Massachusetts Democrat who leads the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Neal is leading a delegation to Mexico for a meeting on Tuesday with President Andr\u00c3\u00a9s Manuel L\u00c3\u00b3pez Obrador to seek final assurances over aspects of the trade agreement. Top Democrats also see the agreement as a vehicle to achieve some major progressive goals that would otherwise be impossible to extract from a Republican administration. Republicans are considering potential sweeteners for Democrats, including a plan to shore up pensions that has been sought by Mr. Neal and labor unions. House Democrats and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, have been exchanging proposals and counterproposals for weeks, trying to satisfy demands for labor and environmental guarantees. Both sides say the confidential talks have produced results that are leading to increasing confidence that Ms. Pelosi will put the measure on the floor relatively soon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has been a patient give-and-go, and I think we have moved the ball toward the goal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Neal said. Even Democrats skeptical of a trade deal based on their previous experience said the talks with Mr. Lighthizer, who has built credibility with the lawmakers, had been substantive and helpful. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been having conversations for I think over a year, and the Democrats made very serious, thoughtful proposals around issues that we have been consistent on over the years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a member of a working group appointed by the speaker to work out Democratic concerns over the agreement. But Ms. DeLauro, who opposed NAFTA and was an early critic of the failed Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, was not quite ready to sign off. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are making headway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur view is that when it is right, we will go. We are not there yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There are substantial issues that could still hold up a final agreement. It is not clear, for instance, how negotiators plan to address Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 objections to a provision that would extend protections to pharmaceutical companies for new products. Democrats argue that such measures could hamper future efforts to enact legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Democrats say that their main fear is that Mexico will not enforce the provisions of the trade deal in areas such as minimum wage requirements and environmental standards, and that the United States will not be allowed to make inspections to determine whether the agreement is being followed. They were alarmed by news reports of labor department budget cuts in Mexico, a fear the Mexican government has raced to alleviate. Republicans lobbying for the agreement argue that supporting it should be an easy choice for Democrats who have long criticized NAFTA, since the new version amounts to an update with several far more progressive elements than the existing agreement, such as new minimum pay levels. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and a chief trade negotiator for President George W. Bush, is a leading proponent of the agreement and has been trying to sell Democrats on its merits. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you vote no on this, that means you are saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go with NAFTA,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and politically for most Democrats, NAFTA is a four-letter word,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Portman said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just think logic prevails in the end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d More than that, some Democrats believe the trade agreement is their best prospect for achieving some bipartisan success in such a highly polarized environment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople understand and appreciate that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to get to yes, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to get it right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Representative Lizzie Fletcher said. Ms. Fletcher, who represents the Houston area, noted in an interview the number of trade relationships between her district and both countries in the new trade agreement, and said sealing the deal would show that the gridlocked Congress could achieve some consensus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople really want to know about how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working together and where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bipartisan agreement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want to know that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to solve real problems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Representative Abigail Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia, said the trade deal was a rare consequential measure that could pass the House without falling victim to Republican resistance in the other chamber or in the White House. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe notable thing about U.S.M.C.A. is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a priority for the Senate and for the president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Spanberger said of the new trade deal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been the case for some of our most impactful legislation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To move the agreement forward, Democrats will need to conclude that it is beneficial enough to them that they are willing to share credit with Mr. Trump over an accomplishment that he will undoubtedly herald in his re-election campaign. Ms. Pelosi, who voted for NAFTA in the House, has told colleagues that she wants to get the new trade agreement approved, and has made clear that she hopes Democrats can separate the impeachment fight and the trade deal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have nothing to do with each other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Pelosi said. She added that if the president did not work with Democrats because they questioned his conduct, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthen the ball is in his court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite the priority the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have put on the trade agreement, some concern has arisen in recent days that Mr. Trump, furious over the impeachment showdown, would pull back on the agreement and try to blame Democrats for its collapse, saying they could not get it done because of a single-minded focus on impeachment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Do Nothing Democrats don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have time to get it done!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump tweeted Thursday about the trade deal. Ultimately, backers of the agreement believe, the White House will embrace congressional approval of the long-sought agreement as a major victory for the president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are pretty bullish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Neil Bradley, executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe speaker is saying all the right things, and they are actually making progress in the negotiations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the end of the day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou want to show that impeachment is not the only thing you are focused on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The House on Monday expanded its sprawling impeachment inquiry, issuing subpoenas to the Defense Department and the Office of Management and Budget for documents that could solve lingering mysteries about whether President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to withhold security aid for Ukraine was tied to his efforts to pressure the government there to investigate his political rivals. The action kicked off what was expected to be another busy week of investigation in Washington, where questions related to Ukraine appear increasingly likely to result in a vote on Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment. Two senior American diplomats caught up in the scandal are scheduled to speak to investigators before the week is through, while a third who was scheduled to be deposed on Monday failed to show up. And lawmakers appeared to be in the final stages of arranging a highly secure interview with the anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower whose complaint prompted the inquiry. As three congressional committees pressed forward to determine the validity of the whistle-blower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint, which accused Mr. Trump of hijacking American foreign policy for his political benefit, the president sounded defiant and continued to lash out at his accusers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople understand it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fraud, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a scam, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a witch hunt, and all we do is keep fighting for the American people because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all I do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said Monday evening at the White House. He called his actions \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery terrific.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But there were also signs of continued Republican uneasiness with his statements and actions. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who had previously raised concerns about the withheld aid money, chastised Mr. Trump on Monday for soliciting foreign assistance for his own political purposes, though he added that he did not view the conduct as impeachable. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president should not have raised the Biden issue on that call, period,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Portman told The Columbus Dispatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not appropriate for a president to engage a foreign government in an investigation of a political opponent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With the new subpoenas issued on Monday, the House was trying to unearth communications and other records that might shed light on two enduring questions at the center of the impeachment inquiry: why the White House decided last summer to abruptly suspend the $391 million aid package to Ukraine, and whether it was connected to contemporaneous efforts by Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to pressure the country to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. The subpoenas, issued by the Democrat-controlled House Intelligence Committee, follow similar demands for documents from the State Department and the White House made in recent days. They gave the agencies until Oct. 15 to hand over notes, memos and communications related to the aid, deliberations over its delivery within the government, and possible conversations with Ukrainian officials about it. Mr. Trump personally ordered his staff to freeze the aid just days before a now infamous July call in which he asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to do him \u00e2\u0080\u009ca favor\u00e2\u0080\u009d and help investigate Mr. Biden and a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election. He lifted a block on its delivery in September only under intense bipartisan pressure from Congress, where lawmakers view the money as vital to combating Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s armed aggression in the region. The White House has denied that the aid was being withheld to exert leverage over the Ukrainians, but at least one senior diplomat worried privately that that was precisely what was happening, and the administration has been unwilling to answer questions about the timeline and rationale for the decision. Regardless of the reasoning, the decision to withhold aid that was allocated by Congress on a bipartisan basis prompted confusion and concern within the State and Defense Departments, which were responsible for delivering the money, as well as among lawmakers in both parties who had a hand in allocating it. Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry in the House suspect the actions may be related. They point to comments in early September by Vice President Mike Pence, who said publicly that a review of the funds was based on White House concerns about \u00e2\u0080\u009cissues of corruption.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the committees to examine this sequence of these events and the reasons behind the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression,\u00e2\u0080\u009d read the letters accompanying the subpoenas, signed by Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee; Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee; and Representative Eliot L. Engel, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The Defense Department had been anticipating a subpoena. Last week, the Pentagon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general counsel directed all department heads to collect and turn in all documents and material related to military aid to Ukraine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stated previously, we are prepared to work with Congress and other relevant parties on questions related to the issue of Ukrainian aid as appropriate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lt. Col. Carla M. Gleason, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said on Monday. The budget office did not reply to a request for comment. The House Appropriations and Budget Committees are reviewing some documents produced by the budget office in response to a separate request the two committees sent in late September about the delay in the foreign aid, aides said on Monday. As the subpoenas stack up, the impeachment inquiry is gaining steam less than three weeks after House leaders opened it. The White House has threatened to try to stonewall investigators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 requests, and Mr. Trump has mounted a near round-the-clock defense of himself. But witnesses have steadily begun to produce documentary evidence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some of which has bolstered the initial complaint \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and a spate of private witness depositions are expected in the coming weeks. The Intelligence Committee also appears to be close to conducting an interview with the whistle-blower himself. The precise format of the meeting, though, remains a matter of deliberation as Democrats seek to protect the identity of the official \u00e2\u0080\u0094 possibly even from congressional Republicans. Whistle-blowers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 disclosures are protected under the law, and their identities are typically carefully guarded. But Mr. Trump has forcefully attacked the whistle-blower, called his actions treason and demanded to learn his identity to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeet my accuser.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Democrats fear Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies on their committee could try to feed details about the official\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity to the White House or to the public, putting the whistle-blower in danger. In addition to logistics, the committee has been waiting for lawyers representing the whistle-blower to receive the requisite security clearances to participate in a congressional interview. Mark S. Zaid, one of the whistle-blower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers, said on Monday that two of the three have now done so and a third is close to completing the process, meaning an interview could be scheduled as soon as late this week. It was unclear whether the lawyers would seek to arrange an interview with Congress and a second intelligence official whom they now represent, and who they said could corroborate parts of the whistle-blower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claims. The investigating committees had scheduled a deposition for Monday with George P. Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state and Ukraine expert, but Mr. Kent did not show up as planned. A committee aide said that conversations about scheduling a new date with Mr. Kent were continuing, and implied that at least three other witnesses scheduled to appear this week were also in doubt. Mr. Kent is the head of the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bureau of European and Eurasian affairs, but he served until 2018 as a top American diplomat in Ukraine. The three others are T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s counselor who the whistle-blower said listened in on the July phone call, and Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Mr. Giuliani, who aided his attempts to gin up investigations in Ukraine. John M. Dowd, a lawyer for Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, wrote to the Intelligence Committee last week that its requests for documents were \u00e2\u0080\u009coverly broad and unduly burdensome\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that its proposed timeline for document production and witness interviews was unreasonable. He accused Democrats of trying to \u00e2\u0080\u009charass, intimidate and embarrass my clients\u00e2\u0080\u009d but did not rule out that they would cooperate. The committee aide said that if Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman failed to comply, they would receive subpoenas compelling them to do so \u00e2\u0080\u009cin short order.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still, two key figures from the State Department were confirmed to participate in their scheduled depositions. Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union who was deeply involved in Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy toward Ukraine, is expected to speak to investigators on Tuesday. And on Friday, they will question Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from her post in May after she was deemed not to be sufficiently supportive of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agenda there.",

McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, was forced offstage at Georgetown University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law school by demonstrators who shut down his planned keynote address as they protested the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immigration policies. Almost immediately after Mr. McAleenan was introduced to give a speech hosted by the Migration Policy Institute, nearly a dozen advocates and law students in the crowd stood up holding signs saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStand with immigrants\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cHate is not normal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Standing at the lectern in front of the packed auditorium, Mr. McAleenan tried to start speaking but was drowned out by chants of: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen immigrants are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The protesters also read the names of the migrants who have died after being detained at the border. The event was the latest effort by opponents of the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard-line immigration policies to let their grievances be known to the policymakers carrying them out. Last year, Stephen Miller, one of the chief architects of President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immigration policies, threw away $80 worth of takeout sushi, fearing that it had been spat on after a Washington bartender screamed at him. Protesters heckled the last confirmed homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, last year as she ate at a Mexican restaurant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe First Amendment guarantees all Americans the right to free speech and assembly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnfortunately that right was robbed from many who were scheduled to speak and attend today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event at Georgetown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Monday, Doris Meissner, the director of United States immigration policy at the Migration Policy Institute and a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, pleaded with protesters to allow Mr. McAleenan to speak. She told them they were \u00e2\u0080\u009crobbing\u00e2\u0080\u009d other members of the audience who came to hear him. The demonstrators said that people at the border were being robbed of their lives. Mr. McAleenan waited for the chants to quiet down and tried to speak at least three times. Visibly frustrated, he thanked Ms. Meissner before walking off the stage. Some people in the audience also expressed disappointment with the protesters. Mr. McAleenan was scheduled to take questions from attendees after his remarks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are some very serious issues that we can talk about in candor in a real dialogue, or we can continue to shout,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. McAleenan said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to take our dialogue today above the politics and the daily news cycle and talk about the challenges and efforts that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve faced over the past year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said that he especially looked forward to the conversation since immigration lawyers, law students and advocates were in the crowd, before being drowned out by the protesters, who justified their actions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our belief that no institution should be elevating, normalizing or legitimizing any of the Trump immigration officials who are quite honestly carrying out policies that are rooted in the white nationalism that Donald Trump and Stephen Miller are so blatantly trying to institutionalize,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nicole Regalado, the campaign director at Credo Action, an advocacy organization, which helped organize the protest. She said more than a dozen organizations sent the organizers of the event a letter requesting that Mr. McAleenan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s invitation be rescinded. About 350 Georgetown law students, faculty members and alumni also signed a separate petition asking for his removal. Ms. Regalado said that the organizations specifically took issue with Mr. McAleenan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in carrying out the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family separation policy, which resulted in more than 2,600 children being removed from their parents. Before he was tapped to lead the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. McAleenan was the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection during the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009czero tolerance\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy. Andrew Selee, the president of the Migration Policy Institute, said the organization regretted that Mr. McAleenan was silenced. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy drowning out the secretary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks, the protesters deprived immigration attorneys, service providers, journalists, advocates, business leaders, law students and many others in the public who were in the audience from hearing his point of view and engaging in a meaningful dialogue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Selee said in a statement. Sabiya Ahamed, a third-year law student at Georgetown focusing on immigration policy, said there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing to debate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we want to see his remarks, we can just look to his polices,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Ahamed said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey speak louder than his words.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. McAleenan has led the Department of Homeland Security, which is tasked with disaster relief, securing the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s borders and defending the United States from terrorism and cyberattacks, at a time when the agency has become increasingly synonymous with the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pursuit to limit legal and illegal immigration to the United States. Under his leadership, the agency has expanded a policy that forces migrants to wait in Mexico for the duration of their asylum case and pushed multiple deals that prevent most migrants from Central America from obtaining asylum at the southwest border. Mr. McAleenan has instead tried to push the migrants to obtain protections in Central American countries. Mr. McAleenan, who worked in Customs and Border Protection under President Barack Obama, has also pushed back against some of the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies, including its attempt to carry out nationwide raids to deport migrant families.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 In the first argument of its new term, the Supreme Court on Monday considered whether states may abolish the insanity defense, a question that seemed to puzzle several of the justices, who drew conflicting lessons from history, moral philosophy, constitutional law and the brutal crimes at the heart of the case. James Kahler of Kansas was sentenced to death in 2011 for killing four family members, but his lawyers said he had severe depression that made it impossible for him to understand reality or to distinguish right from wrong. Kansas eliminated the insanity defense about two decades ago, so he was barred from raising the defense that he had been mentally ill. Sarah Schrup, a lawyer for Mr. Kahler, said that was a radical departure from American legal traditions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor centuries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccriminal culpability has hinged on the capacity for moral judgment, to discern and to choose between right and wrong. The insane lack that capacity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Idaho, Montana and Utah have also abolished the insanity defense, meaning that defendants in those states cannot avoid criminal punishment by showing that their mental illness prevented them from knowing their actions were wrong. Instead, defendants may argue that they lacked the required intent to commit the crime with which they were charged. The distinction matters, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said, using examples. In Kansas, he said, defendants are not culpable if they do not know what they were doing (by, for instance, killing a human being under the delusion that they are killing a dog). But they are culpable, he said, if they do not know that their actions are wrong (by, for instance, believing a dog instructed them to kill a human being). \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe first defendant thinks that Smith is a dog,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Justice Breyer said, referring to a hypothetical victim. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe second defendant knows it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a person but thinks the dog told him to do it. O.K.? What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Toby Crouse, Kansas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 solicitor general, said states should be allowed to make their own judgments in defining responsibility for crimes. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said Mr. Kahler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions did not appear to be those of an insane person. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an intelligent man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Justice Alito said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand he sneaked up on the house, where his wife and her mother and his children were staying. He killed his ex-wife. He killed her mother. He executed his two teenage daughters. One of them is heard on the tape crying. He, nevertheless, shot her to death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, this is the stuff from which you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to make a defense he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that what he was doing was morally wrong, much less he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what he was doing was legally wrong?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Justice Alito asked Ms. Schrup. She responded that Mr. Kahler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers should have been allowed the opportunity to argue that he was insane. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe facts are hard in every case, and they are hard in this case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Schrup said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about is an opportunity, a mechanism for all defendants, to be able to get into the threshold and let a jury decide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Before the argument began, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. announced that Justice Clarence Thomas was \u00e2\u0080\u009cindisposed due to illness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and would participate in the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arguments based on briefs and transcripts. A court spokeswoman said Justice Thomas was resting at home and appeared to have the flu. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who had missed two weeks of arguments in January after cancer surgery, asked the first question. It came later than usual, as the justices, thanks to a new practice announced last week, will now generally allow lawyers to speak for two minutes before peppering them with questions. The argument ended without apparent consensus. Justice Breyer mused that the issue the court would decide in the case, Kahler v. Kansas, No. 18-6135, was a profound one. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite deep, this question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.",

      "author": "Lawrence K. Altman, M.D.",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 As Senator Bernie Sanders recuperates from the heart attack he suffered while campaigning last Tuesday in Las Vegas, he will inevitably face questions in the coming days as to whether he will continue his presidential campaign and, if so, at what pace. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with some facts straightaway. A heart attack does not disqualify anyone from running for and holding public office. Modern medicine enabled Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson and Vice President Dick Cheney to continue in their roles after having suffered heart attacks, as others serving in Congress or state governments have done. (It is important to note that the popular but nonspecific term \u00e2\u0080\u009cheart attack\u00e2\u0080\u009d describes an array of heart problems; one is myocardial infarction, or the death of heart muscle cells, which is what Mr. Sanders had.) By every indication, Mr. Sanders plans to continue his campaign for the presidency, and even told staff members on a telephone call Monday that he feels more \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began this campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [The latest data and analysis to keep track of who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the race\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading candidates, also once faced questions about his ability to serve in public office because of a serious medical problem. In 1988, as a 45-year-old senator from Delaware, he experienced a near fatal rupture of an aneurysm in an artery in his brain. Shortly after his emergency surgery for the aneurysm, he had a second one removed before it could burst. Because new cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals, some experts suggested that Mr. Biden be examined for any new aneurysms when Barack Obama selected him as his running mate. At the time, Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doctor said that he did not need further testing because he had recovered fully and done well for 20 years. Mr. Sanders is certainly not the first candidate whose presidential campaign was disrupted by a medical emergency. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley made an unexpected visit to a hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area for atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, which he did not disclose until after the incident. After canceling a few events, Mr. Bradley, now 76, resumed his campaign, but he eventually dropped out of the race after losing the New Hampshire primary. A poll of New Hampshire voters revealed concern about how he had handled the disclosure of his health issue. Still, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case is unusual in many respects: He is a leading candidate recovering from a heart attack at age 78 who must compete in an intensely competitive primary while also holding down a demanding job as senator. Indeed, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disruption comes amid increased pressure to bolster voter support with strong challenges from Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and it is unclear at what pace Mr. Sanders will carry on his campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBernie will be scrutinized very carefully in the next month or two for his ability to come back and campaign as vigorously as he has done in the 2016 and current presidential campaigns,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ed Rollins, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be looked at a little differently\u00e2\u0080\u009d for things like being tired at the end of the day or stumbling in his delivery onstage, Mr. Rollins added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have never known a politician or big moneyed guy or anyone who has had a first heart attack\u00e2\u0080\u009d not consider his mortality, Mr. Rollins added. Also, Mr. Sanders \u00e2\u0080\u009csurely will think about a running mate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Based on the health information he and his doctor provided when he ran in 2016, it would not have been possible to predict the Vermont senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart attack last week. At that time, his doctor said that Mr. Sanders was \u00e2\u0080\u009cin overall very good health\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that his ailments included gout, a mild elevation of cholesterol, diverticulitis and an underactive thyroid gland for which he took daily hormone therapy. Tests showed that Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thyroid function and electrocardiogram tests were normal and that he had no reported history of heart disease. It is not known whether Mr. Sanders has had a full medical checkup since then. Over the long term, however, \u00e2\u0080\u009colder patients are at higher risk of recurrent cardiac events after a heart attack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Christopher P. Cannon, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hospital in Boston. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Mr. Sanders appears to have few cardiac risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He pointed to data from a series of his team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s published studies that showed a one-in-five chance within five years after a first heart attack that a second one, or even stroke or death, might occur. But such population-based statistics provide general odds and cannot necessarily be applied to an individual. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVery few illnesses would preclude someone from holding high office,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Jonathan S. Reiner, a cardiologist at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, who treated Mr. Cheney for serious heart disease for many years before, during and after his two terms in office. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the public has a right to know the salient details because the ailment or treatment can affect how the candidate performs in office.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although there are legal protections to keep health information confidential, most candidates seeking the presidency in recent years have responded to the public demand to know and have waived that privilege. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe public should have sufficient facts to understand the magnitude of the event and the near- and long-term prognosis for the candidate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Reiner said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign has released too few details to understand the medical impact of the heart attack on his health.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Not all heart attacks, for example, are of the same dimension. Like Mr. Sanders, three other presidential candidates are also septuagenarians. Mr. Biden will be 77 next month and Ms. Warren is 70. All three have said they will release their medical records before the Iowa caucuses that begin in February, although Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incident last week may push his top rivals to disclose their records sooner. Then there is President Trump, who is 73. He has not said whether he would release any health information before or after his third presidential medical checkup, which is expected in early 2020. While presidents are not required to have medical checkups or release findings if they have one, Mr. Trump released a detailed summary after his first presidential exam and a less detailed one after his second, earlier this year.",

She got back to me from a busy press room, just after she finished some reporting on Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to pull back from military involvement in Syria. Lara, we seem to have hit a stalling point in witness depositions. What recourse do Mr. Pompeo and the State Department have at this point? Can he simply block these witnesses from testifying? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that cut and dried. He hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t said he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let them take part. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s said he wants them to have time to consult with administration lawyers. He accused Democrats of going straight to the diplomats and asking them to talk to investigators without the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowing or approving of it. In some cases, the administration might claim some executive privilege to prevent some employees from testifying. Mr. Pompeo also could be called as a witness. He was on the call with Trump and the Ukrainian president. What official action, then, can he take? He could try to delay. And that is what we have seen so far, such as the case of Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine. He said this weekend that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to comply with subpoenas as much as the law requires. It may not be as quick as the House Democrats want. It may be more than what the Trump administration writ large is 100 percent comfortable with. But there will be some kind of meeting in the middle. The State Department is now juggling the news of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to pull back in the Middle East with all of activity around impeachment, right? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s odd, because last week when all of the impeachment stories were breaking, we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get much information at all out of the State Department on almost any topic. This morning, the State Department is talking about Syria and Turkey and very eager to relay its side of the story. It shows how many complex issues American diplomacy is facing, and on such a fast-moving timeline.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The Trump administration said Monday that it had added 28 Chinese organizations to a United States blacklist over concerns about their role in human rights violations, effectively blocking those entities from buying American products. The organizations have been implicated in China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign targeting Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities in the autonomous region of Xinjiang, according to a Commerce Department filing. Among the entities being placed on the list are Hikvision and Dahua Technology, two of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest manufacturers of video surveillance products. It also hits China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well-funded, newly emerging class of artificial-intelligence start-ups. Together, the companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 products are central to China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambitions to be the top global exporter of surveillance technology. The list also includes companies that specialize in artificial intelligence, voice recognition and data as well as provincial and local security bureaus that have helped construct what amounts to a police state in Xinjiang. These entities have been involved \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the implementation of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention and high-technology surveillance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the filing said. The move was announced just days before high-level Chinese and American officials meet in Washington to try to resolve a trade war that has begun inflicting pain on both sides of the Pacific. The blacklist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact on the companies is likely to be mixed. In many cases, they could find ways to replace American components and have likely already stockpiled key parts, limiting the short-term impact. Over the longer term, it could hamper their access to United States and European markets, as well as damage recruitment efforts. American customers, universities and others will likely look askance at striking up relations with Chinese companies on the blacklist. A Commerce Department spokesman said Monday that the action was not related to those talks. But the decision is likely to rankle the Chinese government, which has helped support some of these companies as they have developed into cutting-edge technology firms. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe U.S. government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. Hikvision said in a statement that it strongly opposed the decision and had been trying to address the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerns for the past year. The punishment will \u00e2\u0080\u009churt Hikvision\u00e2\u0080\u0099s U.S. business partners and negatively impact the U.S. economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the company said. China has faced growing condemnation from human rights groups in recent months for its detention of up to one million ethnic Uighurs and other minority Muslims in large internment camps in Xinjiang. Beijing has constructed an advanced surveillance system, in what it describes as an effort to fight Islamic extremism among the Uighurs, the largest ethnic group in Xinjiang. But many Uighurs and others around the world say Chinese officials are trying to suppress their culture and religion. Human Rights Watch has said the violations are of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cscope and scale not seen in China since the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treatment of the Uighurs the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstain of the century.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet administration officials have wavered on how much to keep human rights and economic concerns separate in their negotiations with China. Many officials emphasize that the topics are separate, but the administration has shelved several proposals that would have shined light on China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abuses over concerns that a tough stance could upset trade talks. And President Trump himself has often linked national security and other concerns to trade talks. On Monday, Mr. Trump said \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad\u00e2\u0080\u009d action in Hong Kong, the site of violent protests, would hurt progress on trade and urged China to find a \u00e2\u0080\u009chumane solution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming to make a deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of the Chinese. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got to be a fair deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Trump administration has steadily ratcheted up pressure on China through tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products and other restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States. The administration has also begun looking to restrict exports to China. This year, the administration placed Huawei, the Chinese telecom equipment giant, on the blacklist, saying it posed national security concerns. It added five Chinese entities to the list in June, also citing national security. American companies can still apply for licenses to supply products to organizations that have been placed on the Commerce Department entity list, but the government may deny the applications. The companies on the list help illustrate the breadth and development of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surveillance industry, which increasingly uses predictive technology to track its own citizens, or spot potential protests or crimes as they occur. The new additions include several artificial intelligence start-ups: Megvii, SenseTime and Yitu Technologies. They also include iFlytek, which makes voice recognition software; Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Company, a data forensics company; and Yixin Science and Technology Company, which makes nanotechnology. The listed government entities include Xinjiang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public security bureau and 19 subordinate bureaus and institutes. Several of the firms have grown into global operations while servicing an extensive market in China. Hikvision said it had more than 34,000 employees and dozens of divisions worldwide, and it has supplied products to the Beijing Olympics, the World Cup in Brazil and Linate Airport in Milan. Dahua Technologies has more than 16,000 employees, according to its website, with divisions in North America, Europe and Latin America. The companies run the gamut in terms of capabilities and focus. Some are specialists in facial-recognition systems, voice-recognition software, surveillance cameras and phone tracking systems that are sold largely to China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security forces. Others have ambitions of building systems that can filter social media content and products that could help doctors reach cancer diagnoses. As a result, the impact of the bans will be varied. For the surveillance camera maker Hikvision, which makes a significant portion of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security cameras, the impact could be significant. A block could have a roughly 10 percent impact on revenue, technology research firm Sanford Bernstein said in a Monday note. While the company would have to replace some American-made chips placed in its high-end cameras, most of the impact would come on the back-end servers that help analyze footage as part of its security systems. The impact could be larger in terms of broader sales ambitions. Hikvision has worked to court the American market, including a number of government-connected customers. For those focused on artificial-intelligence software, like Yitu and Megvii, the direct hit could be small. Nonetheless, the blacklist could impact them in other ways. The artificial intelligence start-ups on the list have partnerships with American software firms, connections to American universities and have been active in trying to hire foreign talent. In all those cases, the blocks will likely hamper their efforts.",

      "content": "Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox. Today I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m turning over the top of the newsletter to my colleagues Michael D. Shear, one of our White House correspondents, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis, our congressional editor. Their fantastic new book, which comes out tomorrow, details two years of inside-the-administration reporting on President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signature issue: his opposition to immigration. (The book has already made news by revealing the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desire for an alligator-filled moat along the border and his suggestion that migrants be shot in the legs.) Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what they had to say about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fixation with immigration and what it all may mean for the 2020 race. Six days before the 2018 midterm elections, President Trump got into a shouting match over the phone with Paul Ryan, who was then the speaker of the House. That argument may reveal quite a bit about what to expect from the president when his 2020 campaign ramps up next year. In 2018, Mr. Ryan was furious at Mr. Trump for talking endlessly about immigration \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the dangers from caravans of migrants, a pledge to end birthright citizenship, his obsession with the border. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRyan was exasperated. Trump still didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we write in the book. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are not helping anything by talking about this kind of stuff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Ryan told Mr. Trump. After Republicans lost their majority, the speaker blamed the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments about birthright citizenship, adding that his talk of sealing the border and having American troops shoot at migrants had not helped either. Mr. Trump had made the congressional elections about him and his visceral message of fear and loathing toward immigrants, and voters in vital pockets of the country had recoiled, one of Mr. Ryan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s associates later told a colleague: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had just hijacked the whole thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What does that mean for 2020? At the moment, you could be excused for thinking that the only subject on Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind is the impeachment inquiry aimed at removing him from office. But railing against immigration is in the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electoral DNA. When Mr. Trump announced his 2016 campaign by calling Mexicans \u00e2\u0080\u009crapists,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his political advisers were ecstatic, according to our reporting: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump had been at No. 8 in some polls when he was at the top of the escalator before his announcement. Within weeks, he had shot up to the top of the Republican pack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stephen Miller, the architect of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immigration agenda, told us that voters would \u00e2\u0080\u009cresoundingly side with the political party that secured the border. And not by a little bit. Not by 55-45, 60-40, 70-30, 80-20. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking 90-10 on that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Is that right? According to our reporting, one of the Republican Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading pollsters concluded after the midterms that \u00e2\u0080\u009cimmigration and the caravan had overwhelmed the economic message that Ryan and other Republicans had been trying to highlight by a two-to-one margin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the danger for Mr. Trump. His obsession with immigration could once again overshadow the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax cuts, a 3.5 percent unemployment rate and growth in wages. Even so, expect dire warnings about \u00e2\u0080\u009copen border Democrats,\u00e2\u0080\u009d furious demands to stop asylum seekers and a relentless focus on his \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig beautiful wall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president believes that immigration is what brought him to the White House, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not about to abandon it now.

Another colleague, Shane Goldmacher, spent his weekend standing in the street and sitting in a hotel lobby in Philadelphia, as Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest donors and fund-raisers met for their first big retreat since the campaign began. He sends this dispatch: The gathering of Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most important financiers came at an awkward time. Just a few hours before they toured his Philadelphia headquarters, Senator Elizabeth Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign announced that she had out-raised Mr. Biden by nearly $10 million in the last three months. She was the subject of most of the weekend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conversation, both among Biden officials and the donors, even though Senator Bernie Sanders had actually raised a little more than her. Some donors were downbeat. But mostly there was a palpable sense of determination. These retreats serve two purposes: 1. Thank the donors for the millions they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already raised. 2. Exhort them to raise even more. There were drinks on Friday and a day filled with PowerPoints on Saturday. Most of Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top brass appeared: the campaign manager Greg Schultz, deputy campaign managers Kate Bedingfield and Pete Kavanaugh, senior advisers Crist\u00c3\u00b3bal Alex and Symone Sanders, and Becca Siegel, the chief analytics officer. Oh, and Mr. Biden came too. Several donors said the weekend presentations were thoughtful, well prepared and steady, if not flashy or particularly inspiring. In that way, two attendees separately likened it to Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidacy itself. O.K., so who had Jeff Daniels in the actor-playing-James-Comey betting pool?

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sudden blessing of a Turkish military operation in northern Syria and his announcement of an American troop withdrawal from that region raised questions about the fate of thousands of Islamic State detainees that the Turks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 targets, American-backed Syrian Kurds, have been holding in makeshift wartime prisons. Mr. Trump insisted that Turkey must assume responsibility for the captured ISIS fighters and their families. But it is far from clear what will happen to them, and a host of issues arose from Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abrupt, if still murky, change in policy. The situation is deeply complicated. For now, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces control northern Syria. They have been the primary American ally inside Syria in the war against the Islamic State, carrying out the brunt of the ground-level fighting with support from American airstrikes and weapons. They operate prisons where ISIS members are detained. The Kurds are menaced from the north by Turkey, which has been fighting separatist Kurds inside its borders for years and considers the Syrian Kurds to be terrorists, too. Meanwhile, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, backed by Russia, controls the southern part of the country and wants to eventually retake it all, raising the possibility of a deal with the Kurds. The presence of American troops has helped maintain a fragile peace. But the White House said that Mr. Trump has given a green light for a Turkish military operation into northern Syria, and Mr. Trump said on Twitter that it was time to pull out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u00e2\u0080\u0098neighborhood.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Syrian Democratic Forces operate an archipelago of ad hoc wartime detention sites for captive ISIS fighters, ranging from former schoolhouses in towns like Ainissa and Kobane to a former Syrian government prison at Hasaka. The prisons hold about 11,000 men, of whom about 9,000 are locals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Syrians or Iraqis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and about 2,000 come from some 50 other nations whose home governments have been reluctant to repatriate them. They also operate camps for families displaced by the conflict that hold tens of thousands of people, many of them non-Syrian wives and children of Islamic State fighters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Turkey attacks these Kurdish soldiers, there is a grave risk that the ISIS fighters they guard will escape and return to the battlefield,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a bipartisan group of lawmakers who recently visited the Middle East said in a joint statement on Monday. This is one of many unknowns. An American-brokered plan in the works would create a demilitarized \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe zone\u00e2\u0080\u009d a few miles deep along a roughly 78-mile portion of the Syrian-Turkish border to reassure Turkey and forestall any military conflict with the Kurds. That would not affect the Kurds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to keep running the prisons. But Mr. Erdogan, speaking at the United Nations General Assembly last month, has instead pushed for a much longer and deeper zone. A broader invasion could reach the prisons, and it would set off an armed conflict that could prompt the Kurds to pull guards from prisons so they could instead join the fight. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cworst-case scenario\u00e2\u0080\u009d is that the Kurds are so frustrated and angered by the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 action that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey decide to release wholesale some of the detainees,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Christopher P. Costa, a former senior director for counterterrorism on Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Security Council who now heads the International Spy Museum. It was not clear. The White House said Turkey would \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Turkey has given no public sign that it has agreed to take over that headache. For now at least, the Kurds have told American officials that they will continue to hold the ISIS detainees. But a senior State Department official acknowledged that the best-trained guards could be pulled away in the event of a conflict with Turkey, calling it a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig concern\u00e2\u0080\u009d that some ISIS fighters could go free. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to imagine Turkey has the capacity to handle securely and appropriately the detainees long held by the Syrian Kurds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s if Turkey even genuinely intends to try,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joshua A. Geltzer, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council in the Obama administration. [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to follow the American withdrawal of troops from Syria.] The Kurds have implored countries around the world to take back their citizens who fought for the Islamic State and were captured. But that idea is politically unpopular in many European countries. Mr. Trump is correct that nations like Belgium, Britain, France and Germany have been largely content to let the Kurds bear the burden of detaining their citizens \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly the male fighters. Many European law enforcement officials fear that if they repatriate their extremist citizens, they would be unable to convict them or keep them locked up for a long time. European counterterrorism laws are weaker than those in the United States, where a conviction merely for joining a designated terrorist group can yield a 15-year prison sentence. But Mr. Trump was wrong when he also said that the captured ISIS fighters were \u00e2\u0080\u009cmostly from Europe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While scores of the imprisoned men have European citizenship, far more come from other countries that are part of the Muslim world \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen, to say nothing of the thousands of local Syrians and Iraqis. Unlike many other countries, the United States has taken its citizens off the Kurds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hands. But there are two British detainees still in Kurdish custody whom the United States has a particular interest in keeping locked up: El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey. They are two of the so-called Beatles, a four-member cell of British ISIS members who tortured and murdered Western hostages, including James Foley, the American journalist who was beheaded in August 2014 for an ISIS propaganda video. Another member of the cell, who was later killed in a drone strike, is believed to have killed Mr. Foley. The Justice Department intends to eventually bring them to the Eastern District of Virginia for trial, but a court fight in Britain has delayed that transfer. The lawsuit is over whether the British government may share evidence with the United States without an assurance that American prosecutors will not seek the death penalty. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good day for the Beatles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is normally a staunch Trump ally but who denounced the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplete chaos\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ca disaster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a phone interview, Mr. Graham vowed to lead a congressional vote to try to impose sanctions on Turkey if it invades northern Syria, despite Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acquiescence.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 For nine months, the Pentagon played down the presence of its 1,000 troops in Syria, hoping that President Trump would not focus on the extent to which the American military was continuing to fight the Islamic State despite his order in December to pull out. On Sunday, the president appeared to say he had had enough. Now, for the second time in less than a year, the Defense Department, the State Department, Congress and staff across the national security establishment are scrambling to respond to the words of a president who views Syria and the fight against ISIS as a battle largely won and done for American troops. On Monday, after a White House announcement the night before that Mr. Trump was moving American troops out of the way of a threatened Turkish incursion into Syria, Defense Department officials were struggling to put their already piecemeal Syria military strategy back together again. It will not be easy. Caught between furious Kurdish allies who see Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement as abandonment, an authoritarian Turkish leader who may take Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words as tacit permission to move against Kurds in northern Syria, and an American president who has made clear he wants out of the region, the Pentagon is approaching a junction that the military feared was coming for some time. The Defense Department \u00e2\u0080\u009cmade lemonade out of lemons\u00e2\u0080\u009d the first time Mr. Trump announced a Syria withdrawal, said Derek Chollet, an assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. The Pentagon withdrew 1,000 of its 2,000 troops, moved some command elements to Iraq, and continued to aid Kurdish fighters still fighting the Islamic State and holding some 11,000 Islamic State prisoners of war. But officials did not trumpet their mission or their efforts. It will be a lot harder to pull this feint again, military experts said, particularly if President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey goes ahead with his threatened incursion into northern Syria, as it has been the presence of American troops alongside the Kurds that many believe has kept him at bay. Pentagon officials were insisting on Monday that the United States remained firmly opposed to a Turkish incursion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Department of Defense made clear to Turkey \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as did the president \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in northern Syria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jonathan Hoffman, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. He warned that \u00e2\u0080\u009cunilateral action creates risk for Turkey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which would be responsible for thousands of Islamic State fighters being held by the Kurds. But the departure of American troops from northern Syria makes it far more difficult to hold together the coalition fighting the Islamic State. For a while, the generals at the Pentagon thought they were succeeding within the narrow confines of maneuver room that Mr. Trump gave them, obeying the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order while not deserting Kurdish partners and undercutting gains against the Islamic State in northeastern Syria. Defense Department officials devised a plan for the Pentagon to cut its combat force there roughly in half by early this past May, or to about 1,000 troops \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then pause with what commanders called a \u00e2\u0080\u009cresidual force.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The military would then assesses conditions on the ground and reduce the number of forces periodically, if conditions allowed, until the force levels reached the 400 troops that Mr. Trump approved in February. And, above all else, military officials decided they would keep quiet about Syria. The strategy extended all the way to combat outposts in the country, where Special Forces officers were reminded that their mission could end quickly if the commander in chief was publicly reminded that there were still 1,000 troops there, according to one officer who recently returned from Syria. The longer withdrawal timetable gave the Trump administration more time to negotiate with European allies who had said they would not leave troops in Syria if the United States withdrew all of its forces. It was also supposed to allow more time for Washington to work out details of a safe zone south of the Turkish border, where Mr. Erdogan wants to repatriate hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees now in Turkey. Turkey also wants to make sure Kurdish fighters cannot launch terrorist attacks across its border. By late March, the American withdrawal settled around 1,000 troops \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what the military calls an \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomy of force\u00e2\u0080\u009d mission. The troops effectively operated between two allies: Turkey and the Kurds. Turkey is a decades-long NATO partner. The Syrian Kurds are much more recent allies, but have played a pivotal role as the major ground force against the Islamic State. The problem for Washington has been that the two hate each other. After Mr. Erdogan threatened in early August to carry out a cross-border operation to attack the Syrian Kurds, American diplomats and commanders rushed to establish a series of confidence-building measures \u00e2\u0080\u0094 joint reconnaissance flights and ground patrols by American and Turkish forces \u00e2\u0080\u0094 along a 75-mile stretch of the 300-mile border east of the Euphrates River. The American troops in northeastern Syria, largely teams of Special Forces, also provide important logistics, intelligence and other support for Syrian Kurdish fighters who continue to carry out raids and disrupt operations against Islamic State targets. [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to follow the American withdrawal of troops from Syria.] Since the American-backed forces ousted the Islamic State from its last shard of territory in Syria seven months ago, the terrorist group has been gathering new strength, officials say, conducting guerrilla attacks across Iraq and Syria, retooling its financial networks and targeting new recruits at a giant allied-run tent camp in northeastern Syria called Al Hol. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter enlisting support from the Kurds to help destroy ISIS and assuring Kurdish protection from Turkey, the U.S. has now opened the door to their destruction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, and Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said in a statement on Monday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis severely undercuts America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credibility as a reliable partner and creates a power vacuum in the region that benefits ISIS.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pentagon officials say the American presence, and several million dollars in assistance to maintain and upgrade the Syrian Kurds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 makeshift jails in northeastern Syria, has ensured the Kurds continue to detain about 11,000 ISIS fighters, including more than 2,000 foreigners. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to imagine Turkey has the capacity to handle securely and appropriately the detainees long held by the Syrian Kurds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s if Turkey even genuinely intends to try,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joshua A. Geltzer, a former senior director for counterterrorism on the National Security Council in the Obama administration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe release or escape of such detainees would instantly energize ISIS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts, already underway, to regroup and surge again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Almost every part of the Bill of Rights applies to both the federal government and to the states, but the Supreme Court on Monday wrestled with whether to tolerate a rare exception for non-unanimous jury verdicts in criminal cases. Such verdicts are forbidden in federal trials under the Sixth Amendment but permitted in ones held in state court. There seemed little doubt that the justices would have found the question fairly easy absent a confusing 1972 decision that said the Constitution required federal juries to render unanimous verdicts but allowed divided state juries. The vote was 4 to 1 to 4, and only Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., who cast the controlling vote, said federal and state cases could be treated differently. Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, Ramos v. Louisiana, No. 18-5924, concerned Evangelisto Ramos, a Louisiana man who was convicted in 2016 of killing a woman in New Orleans. The jury\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vote was 10 to 2, which was enough under the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law at the time. Louisiana has since amended its state Constitution to bar non-unanimous verdicts, but the move came too late to help Mr. Ramos, as it applies only to crimes committed after 2018. Oregon is the last state that allows non-unanimous verdicts in criminal cases. Jeffrey L. Fisher, a lawyer for Mr. Ramos, urged the court to protect dissenting voices on juries. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have one or two members of a minority on a jury, it could be a racial minority, it could be a political minority, it could be a religious minority,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre we really prepared to say that those one or two votes can be utterly canceled out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Bill of Rights originally restricted the power of only the federal government, but the Supreme Court has ruled that most of its protections apply to the states under the 14th Amendment, one of the post-Civil War amendments. In February, for instance, the court unanimously ruled that the Eighth Amendment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excessive fines clause applied to the states. That left the unanimous jury requirement as one of the very few remaining outliers. Elizabeth Murrill, Louisiana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solicitor general, spent most of her time arguing that the court had been wrong to require unanimous juries in either state or federal court. The Sixth Amendment does not mention the requirement, she said, meaning that non-unanimous verdicts should be permissible in both. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh asked Ms. Murrill for her best arguments for treating state juries differently from federal ones should the court reject her Sixth Amendment argument. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJustice Kavanaugh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she responded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey are concededly not very good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Justice Kavanaugh also asked about what he said was the ugly history of Louisiana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unanimity requirement, saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe rule in question here is rooted in racism, you know, rooted in a desire, apparently, to diminish the voices of black jurors in the late 1890s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In 1898, Louisiana held a constitutional convention whose purpose, as the chairman of its judiciary committee put it, was \u00e2\u0080\u009cto establish the supremacy of the white race in this state to the extent to which it could be legally and constitutionally done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Much of Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument was a debate over respect for precedent, a topic that has recently consumed and divided the justices. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the court had been \u00e2\u0080\u009clectured pretty sternly in a couple of dissents\u00e2\u0080\u009d in two recent cases in which its conservative majority had overturned precedents. Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal and the author of one of those dissents, followed up with questions exploring how Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case might present different issues. And Ms. Murrill, the lawyer for Louisiana, mentioned the case not far from the surface whenever the justices discuss precedent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe significant line of jurisprudence that comes to my mind is Roe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, referring to Roe v. Wade.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 When Energy Secretary Rick Perry led an American delegation to the inauguration of Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new president in May, he took the opportunity to suggest the names of Americans the new Ukrainian government might want to advise and oversee the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s state-owned gas company. Mr. Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus during the trip on Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy industry was in keeping with a push he had begun months earlier under the previous Ukrainian president, and it was consistent with United States policy of promoting anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine and greater energy independence from Russia. But his actions during the trip have entangled him in a controversy about a pressure campaign waged by President Trump and his allies directed at the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. That effort sought to pressure Mr. Zelensky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government to investigate Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination to challenge Mr. Trump. Mr. Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trip raised questions about whether he was seeking to provide certain Americans help in gaining a foothold in the Ukrainian energy business at a time when the new Ukrainian government was looking to the United States for signals of support in its simmering conflict with Russia. Mr. Trump seemed to suggest last week that he made a July 25 phone call to Mr. Zelensky, during which he repeatedly urged his Ukrainian counterpart to pursue investigations that could politically benefit him, at the urging of Mr. Perry. Mr. Trump told congressional Republicans last week that Mr. Perry wanted him to discuss the liquefied natural gas supply with Mr. Zelensky, Axios reported. That topic did not specifically come up in the call between the two leaders, according to the reconstructed transcript released by the White House. Text messages released last week by House investigators showed that other officials were suggesting that the president speak with Mr. Zelensky to nail down an agreement for Ukraine to move ahead with the investigations being sought by Mr. Trump. At a news conference on Monday in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was meeting with Ukrainian and Polish energy officials, Mr. Perry said he asked Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009cmultiple times\u00e2\u0080\u009d to hold a phone call with Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in the diplomacy between the countries highlights the degree to which Mr. Trump entrusted his Ukraine policy to an ad hoc coalition of loyalists inside and outside the government, especially after the recall of the ambassador to Ukraine amid questions among Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters about her loyalty to the president. It also reveals the extent to which Ukrainian politics and national security revolve around energy supplies. Mr. Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts, while broadly consistent with American national security and energy objectives, intersected with those of the figures involved in the pressure campaign. Two American diplomats who attended Mr. Zelensky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inauguration with Mr. Perry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, then the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s special envoy to Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pushed Mr. Zelensky to publicly commit to the investigations and were involved in setting up the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. They appeared to work on the effort with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer and a leading force in the campaign to pressure the Ukrainian government to pursue the investigations. Two associates of Mr. Giuliani also sought changes to the leadership of the Ukrainian state-owned gas company, Naftogaz. Those changes would have required approval from a supervisory board Mr. Perry sought to shape. One of Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s associates, Lev Parnas, pitched a liquefied natural gas deal to the chief executive of Naftogaz in early spring, as The New York Times reported last month. The deal was rejected by the Naftogaz executive. But Mr. Parnas and a partner who was also involved in Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political efforts in Ukraine, Igor Fruman, also sought to install a presumptive ally as Naftogaz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive. They told a gas executive named Andrey Favorov that they could use their American political connections to help him become chief executive of Naftogaz, suggesting that, if appointed, he might steer the company to buy liquefied natural gas from them, according to Dale Perry, the managing partner of a company that competes with one run by Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. Mr. Favorov, who is a lower-ranking executive at Naftogaz, rejected the proposal, which was first reported by The Associated Press. Dale Perry, who is not related to the energy secretary, said he found it \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery troubling and disturbing\u00e2\u0080\u009d that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman boasted that they had worked with Mr. Giuliani to force the recall this spring of the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch. But people in Ukraine and the United States who are familiar with the conversations said the Ukrainian government had requested recommendations from Mr. Perry for Americans who could advise Naftogaz and the government on governance reforms and liquefied natural gas transportation. Mr. Perry recommended four Americans as possible advisers on energy issues, according to the Americans and Ukrainians who are familiar with the conversations. Names floated included Carlos Pascual, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, and Daniel Yergin, an author and energy expert who has worked with Mr. Pascual at an energy advisory firm. Mr. Perry, a former governor of Texas, specifically recommended two Texas-based investors who work in Ukraine, Michael Bleyzer and Robert Bensh, for a supervisory board of Naftogaz, according to the Americans and Ukrainians familiar with the conversations. Mr. Bleyzer, a Republican donor, has proposed gas deals with Naftogaz, according to people familiar with his efforts. Shaylyn Hynes, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said in a statement on Monday night that Mr. Perry \u00e2\u0080\u009chas consistently called for the modernization and reform of Kiev\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business and energy sector in an effort to create an environment that will incentivize Western companies to do business in Ukraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As part of that effort, and at the request of Mr. Zelensky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration, Ms. Hynes said Mr. Perry \u00e2\u0080\u009crecommended the names of some widely respected individuals in the American energy sector, including government experts\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the Energy Department. But, she said Mr. Perry \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid not recommend these individuals be placed on any board.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nonetheless, the circulation of the names of Mr. Bleyzer and Mr. Bensh as possible Naftogaz appointments led to speculation that Naftogaz was considering removing from the supervisory board a former Obama administration official named Amos J. Hochstein. Mr. Hochstein had worked with Mr. Biden on his Ukraine efforts as vice president. That imbued the discussion about the board appointments with political overtones at a time when Democrats were beginning to build an impeachment case around the actions of Mr. Trump and his team to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, who had served on the board of a private Ukrainian gas company. Adding to the complexity of the situation: When Mr. Zelensky dispatched one of his top aides to Washington in July to meet with members of Congress and the Trump administration, and to try to connect with Mr. Giuliani, some of the meetings on Capitol Hill were arranged by a Naftogaz lobbyist, and attended by a Naftogaz official. Naftogaz, until just a few years ago a money-losing monopoly stained by corruption, has been substantially overhauled in recent years to survive without Russian gas and to compete in the European Union market. To comply with European Union regulations and be able to sell Ukrainian gas to the bloc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy-hungry countries, the company has been weaning itself off subsidies and spinning off its gas-transmission operations into a new entity with a guaranteed income of at least $2 billion a year. Naftogaz officials said that this company, which will come into existence in January, and Naftogaz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations storing gas underground could attract American investments, and that they were at the heart of what the United States administration was interested in. Naftogaz officials said the American interest was sufficient that Mr. Sondland held further discussions about the planned spinoff of the transmission operations in Brussels.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 In a pair of exceptionally hard-fought arguments on Tuesday, the Supreme Court struggled to decide whether a landmark 1964 civil rights law bars employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and transgender status. Job discrimination against gay and transgender workers is legal in much of the nation, and the wide-ranging arguments underscored the significance of what could be a momentous ruling. If the court decides that the law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, applies to many millions of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees across the nation, they would gain basic protections that other groups have long taken for granted. The cases were the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first on L.G.B.T. rights since the retirement last year of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinions in all four of the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major gay rights decisions. And without Justice Kennedy, who joined four liberals in the 5-to-4 ruling granting same-sex couples the right to marry, the workers who sued their employers in the three cases before the court may face an uphill fight. For the most part, the justices seemed divided along predictable ideological lines on Tuesday. But there was one possible exception: Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, a member of the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conservative majority, who asked questions suggesting that his vote might be in play. Justice Gorsuch is an avowed believer in textualism, meaning that he considers the words Congress enacted rather than evidence drawn from other sources. And he repeatedly suggested that the words of Title VII may well bar employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and transgender status. The question was, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009creally close, really close.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he added that he was worried about \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe massive social upheaval\u00e2\u0080\u009d that would follow from a Supreme Court ruling saying so. Such a significant change, he mused, might be more appropriate coming from Congress rather than the courts. Title VII outlawed discrimination based on race, religion, national origin and, notably, sex. The question for the justices was how broadly to read that last term. The court considered the question in two hourlong arguments. The first concerned a pair of lawsuits from gay men who say they were fired because of their sexual orientation. The second was about a suit from a transgender woman, Aimee Stephens, who said her employer fired her when she announced that she would embrace her gender identity at work. In both, the justices considered a host of flash points in the culture wars involving the L.G.B.T. community \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including sports, dress codes, religious objections to same-sex couples and, especially, bathrooms. In the first argument, on sexual-orientation discrimination, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. posed skeptical questions to Pamela S. Karlan, a lawyer for two men who said they had been fired for being gay. Justice Alito suggested that it would be absurd to conclude that when Congress passed Title VII, it intended to protect gay people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to change the meaning of what Congress understood sex to mean and what everybody understood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told Ms. Karlan. Ms. Karlan said sexual-orientation discrimination was a form of sex discrimination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen an employer fires a male employee for dating men but does not fire female employees who date men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Karlan said, \u00e2\u0080\u009che violates Title VII.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Justice Elena Kagan said that conduct satisfied what she said was the law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cextremely simple test\u00e2\u0080\u009d: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould the same thing have happened to you if you were of a different sex?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Justice Kagan added that hewing closely to the words of the statute was how the court ordinarily went about its work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the text of the statute appears to be pretty firmly in Ms. Karlan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you discriminate against somebody, against her client, because of sex? Yes, you did. Because you fired the person because this was a man who loved other men.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe usual kind of way in which we interpret statutes now. We look to laws. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look to predictions. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look to desires. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look to wishes. We look to laws.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Justice Alito said the public would find it hard to accept a ruling from the Supreme Court interpreting Title VII to encompass other forms of discrimination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the court takes this up and interprets this 1964 statute to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will be acting exactly like a legislature.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said he was concerned that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would not adequately protect employers with religious objections to same-sex relationships and transgender status. Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that firing a member of a gay couple was no different from firing a Catholic for marrying a Jew. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are many people, at least in the religious context,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho are against intermarriage and are not against Catholics or Jews. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an unrealistic example.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco, representing the Trump administration, said it was up to Congress and not the courts to change the law. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe issue is not whether Congress can or should prohibit employment discrimination because of sexual orientation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe issue, rather, is whether it did so when it prohibited discrimination because of sex.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A lawyer for the employers in the sexual-orientation cases, Jeffrey M. Harris, argued that if Congress had meant to cover L.G.B.T. people, there would have been no need for states to address the question in their own laws, which some two dozen have done. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSex and sexual orientation are independent and distinct characteristics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as true today as it was in 1964.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some legal experts said the transgender case, argued second, was the easier one for the plaintiffs, since discrimination against transgender people certainly sounds like discrimination based on sex. At the same time, they said, a ruling protecting transgender people would open a new front in the culture wars. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the court could not ignore the impact of its decisions on who can use which bathrooms. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not avoid the difficult issue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have a transgender person who rightly is identifying as a woman and wants to use the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bathroom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there are other women who are made uncomfortable, and not merely uncomfortable, but who would feel intruded upon if someone who still had male characteristics walked into their bathroom. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we have different bathrooms. So the hard question is: How do we deal with that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d David D. Cole, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, responded that the question was not before the court. If it arose in a future case, he said, the court could address it then. Justice Alito asked whether a transgender woman could play on a women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s college sports team. That issue, Mr. Cole said, was also not before the court. Justice Gorsuch asked whether a ruling in favor of Mr. Cole\u00e2\u0080\u0099s client would do away with sex-specific dress codes. Mr. Cole said no. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRecognizing that transgender people have a right to exist in the workplace and not be turned away because of who they are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes not end dress codes or restrooms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are transgender male lawyers in this courtroom following the male dress code and going to the men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cole said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dress code and sex-segregated restrooms have not fallen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But John J. Bursch, a lawyer for the funeral home that fired Ms. Stephens, said a ruling in her favor would have vast consequences. It would mean, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat a women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overnight shelter must hire a man who identifies as a woman to serve as a counselor to women who have been raped, trafficked and abused, and also share restroom, shower and locker room facilities with them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Near the end of the arguments, Justice Sotomayor appeared to urge the court to act to protect historically disfavored groups. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny that homosexuals are being fired merely for being who they are and not because of religious reasons, not because they are performing their jobs poorly, not because they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do whatever is required of a position,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut merely because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a suspect class to some people. They may have power in some regions, but they are still being beaten, they are still being ostracized from certain things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The cases concerning gay rights are Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga., No. 17-1618, and Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda, No. 17-1623. The case on transgender rights is R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, No. 18-107. Over the course of two hours, five lawyers used a host of comparisons to try to persuade the justices that various forms of discrimination were or were not similar. Justice Alito, himself a master of the telling hypothetical question, at one point declared himself lost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will make your head spin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of the comparisons, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you try to figure them all out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "The truck drivers at Phoenix Transit & Logistics in Dearborn, Mich., are long gone. Around three dozen of the trailers they once ferried between auto plants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 packed with dashboards, engine components, lights and other parts for General Motors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are sitting in a lot with nowhere to go. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an increasingly familiar scene as the strike against G.M. by the United Auto Workers enters its fourth week. From suppliers to shippers to restaurants, the impact of the work stoppage is spreading through the web of businesses whose fates are tied to the biggest American automaker. Wael Tlaib, the owner of Phoenix Transit & Logistics, said he had laid off nearly his entire staff, including 80 drivers, and had dipped into his personal savings to keep his company afloat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI might lose the business next week,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Tlaib said. The most intense economic pain is being felt in the industrial Midwest, where G.M.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s network of plants and suppliers is thickest. It is a difficult time for the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manufacturing industry, which even before the strike was contending with slowing auto sales, a weakening global economy and the trade war. An economic blow to the Midwest would have broad consequences in part because the region is an important political battleground that will help determine who wins the 2020 presidential election. In 2016, President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s narrow victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin put him over the top in the Electoral College tally. The state of the auto industry \u00e2\u0080\u009cusually has political ramifications that are beyond its direct economic influence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Matt Grossmann, a political-science professor at Michigan State University. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of Democrats here are running on the promise to help the factory workers and the working class, and saying Trump hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nearly 50,000 U.A.W. members walked off the job on Sept. 16, the largest stoppage since G.M. workers went on strike in 2007. The union is pressing for more job security as well as the reopening of plants in the United States that the company has recently idled. For its part, G.M. wants to limit wage increases, slow the growth of health care costs, and gain flexibility in how plants are staffed and operated. After signs of progress over the last week, the two sides hit a roadblock this weekend on how production might be moved to the United States from Mexico. Terry Dittes, the U.A.W.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead negotiator, said on Sunday that the talks had taken a \u00e2\u0080\u009cturn for the worse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The impact of the strike stretches from Mexico to Canada, where G.M. plants that depend on American factories have been shuttered, putting thousands out of work. Analysts estimate that G.M. has lost $600 million as a result of the strike. In the United States, 34 G.M. plants have gone dark. And striking workers are making do with a $250-a-week subsidy from the union. [Watch \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Weekly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new TV show, report on GM and its workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fight to survive in Lordstown, Ohio.] In the first three weeks of the strike, $412 million in wages were lost, according to Patrick Anderson, chief executive of Anderson Economic Group. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEach week the damage grows geometrically,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Anderson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst you lose your U.A.W. workers, then the immediate suppliers, then the next tiers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Michigan has the most exposure to the auto sector, with roughly 8 percent of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy linked to the industry. Even after factory closings decimated employment in the car industry in recent decades, the state remains dotted with auto plants and suppliers. Gabriel Ehrlich, director of the University of Michigan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Research Seminar in Qualitative Economics, estimates that the Michigan economy is growing at an annual rate of 1.4 percent. Without the strike, he said, that number could be 0.1 to 0.2 points higher. Even before the strike, manufacturing employment in Michigan fell by 1,300 jobs in the first eight months of the year. By comparison, manufacturers added 43,000 jobs nationally in the same period. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been real damage to the economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Charles Ballard, an economics professor at Michigan State. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been huge yet, but the ripple effects will get bigger the longer this goes on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In Flint, at least 1,200 truckers and production workers from suppliers have lost their jobs because of the strike. That includes hundreds from a supplier of seats to G.M., Lear Corporation, according to Duane Ballard, the financial secretary for U.A.W. Local 659, which represents employees at that factory. A Lear spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Many of those workers are new hires who have not worked at the Lear plant long enough to qualify for state unemployment insurance, Mr. Ballard said. On a rainy night last week, more than two dozen people affected by the strike showed up at the Martus Luna Food Pantry in Flint, said Art Luna, who runs the pantry. They \u00e2\u0080\u009care the ones that are really hurting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re anxious to go back to work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fallout has extended beyond the auto industry, disrupting local businesses that serve autoworkers. On a typical Saturday night, Luigi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Restaurant, a short drive from the Lear factory, sees around 350 customers. But in recent weeks, that number has fallen by as many as 60 people, according to Tom Beaubien, who runs the Italian restaurant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter one week without pay, everybody starts to suffer, from McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all the way to Luigi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Restaurant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Beaubien said. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear just how many workers have been laid off by G.M.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suppliers. Magna International, one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest auto suppliers, has idled \u00e2\u0080\u009ca few\u00e2\u0080\u009d plants, according to a spokeswoman, Tracy Fuerst. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe attempted to keep our employees at these impacted plants working as long as possible through training, maintenance and inventory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Some G.M. suppliers are finding creative ways to keep workers occupied, whether repairing machines or building an inventory of auto components to ship later. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour smarter suppliers are being very careful about how they lay people off,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael Robinet, an expert on the auto industry at IHS Markit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to lose their better employees to a competitor or to another occupation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of course, Michigan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy is not as dependent on the auto sector as it was even two decades ago. Lansing has two G.M. plants, but their economic weight is counterbalanced by the state government and the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hospital system, said Andy Schor, the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor. Another large employer, Michigan State University, is nearby. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sooner they resolve this the better, but I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say everything has shut down in Lansing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Schor said. Over all, G.M. and its suppliers account for 6,600 jobs with $250 million in annual wages in the city, which has roughly 118,000 residents. Mr. Schor said autoworkers had been asking the city-owned utility for more time to pay their electric and water bills. Yet even at companies that are not highly dependent on G.M., the effect of the strike was immediate. Pridgeon & Clay, a component maker that sells to G.M.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suppliers, froze hiring right away. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe heard from our customers within hours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said R. Kevin Clay, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president. Business had already been a little soft at Pridgeon & Clay, which is based in Grand Rapids, Mich., when the strike began. G.M. suppliers account for about $13 million of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $300 million in annual revenue. Now parts destined for the automaker are piled up in corners of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distribution center. Mr. Clay said he was determined to avoid layoffs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly eating into profitability, but rather than cut people, you pinch every penny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Other manufacturers, like Stripmatic in Cleveland, say manpower has been tight recently, and the strike has freed workers for other tasks. But Bill Adler, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president, said business could suffer if G.M.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plants didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t resume production soon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the strike goes on much longer, what started out as a very good year could turn into a mediocre year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Around the country, G.M. dealers said inventories had grown somewhat tighter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had a pretty deep shelf when the strike started and are at about average inventory right now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mark Scarpelli, president of Raymond Chevrolet in Antioch, Ill. G.M. said last week that its American dealers had 760,000 vehicles at the end of September, down 5 percent from a year ago. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough to last several weeks, but dealers are nearing the time when they place orders for the brisk sales they usually see around the end of the year. Back in Dearborn, Mr. Tlaib of Phoenix Transit & Logistics is doing what he can to get trucks back on the road. He emptied five of his trailers into a warehouse, freeing them to carry parts for other companies. But that has made barely a dent in the G.M. inventory in his yard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen next,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just sit down and smoke and watch the news.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "The South Lawn of the White House was decked out in New York City paraphernalia for President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first congressional picnic: food carts, boat racing and a Central Park-like carousel, all in honor of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hometown. Chris Collins, a Republican House member from western New York, should have been in his element. He had shot to fame the year before as the first member of Congress to endorse Mr. Trump for president. He had since channeled that fame into a spot on Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transition team and frequent appearances on cable news. But on that early summer evening in 2017, Mr. Collins seemed distracted. Standing apart from the festivities, he paced back and forth on the White House lawn, his cellphone pressed to his ear. When Jared Kushner, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son-in-law, strode by, Mr. Collins did not seem to notice. On the other end of the call was Mr. Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son. And the six-minute exchange that transpired would form the basis of an insider trading investigation that led to Mr. Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indictment, and to his resignation and guilty plea last week. His son has also pleaded guilty. The story of Mr. Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise and fall \u00e2\u0080\u0094 businessman to congressional backbencher, then presidential cheerleader to felon \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is a tale of money, politics, family ties and murky ethics. It is also the story of a man who rose to prominence by hitching himself to\u00c2\u00a0Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and whose star then plummeted as quickly as it rose. Long before Mr. Collins emerged as one of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staunchest defenders, the two shared some similarities. In 2007, Mr. Collins, a wealthy entrepreneur who had never held elected office, pulled off an upset win in the county executive race in Erie County, which includes Buffalo. (An earlier bid for Congress in 1998 was unsuccessful.) Mr. Collins, who made his fortune by turning around struggling companies, had campaigned on a promise to put his business know-how to work in county government. He succeeded, slashing debt and pulling Erie County back from near bankruptcy. But he also developed a reputation as arrogant, ambitious and prone to offensive comments. In 2009, he called the Democratic Assembly speaker the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAntichrist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a move that many credited with dashing his hopes of a 2010 run for governor. He was overheard at a governor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech telling a woman that she could find a seat in exchange for a \u00e2\u0080\u009clap dance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He lost his re-election for county executive in 2011. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe guy is about as cuddly as a cactus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a columnist for The Buffalo News wrote. Still, the next year, Mr. Collins ran for Congress and won, aided by newly redrawn borders for the 27th District as well as his personal wealth, which financial disclosures showed included investment assets of as much as $112 million. Yet his reputation for self-aggrandizement followed him to Washington. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he brought an attitude of, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not a regular freshman,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tom Reynolds, a former Republican congressman who had represented parts of Mr. Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s district, said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost would put it down that he started with a pretty good arrogant streak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He took a similar approach to separating his political life from his finances. During his first term, he said he saw \u00e2\u0080\u009cno compelling reason\u00e2\u0080\u009d to put his assets in a blind trust. Over the next few years, he continued to invest heavily in health care companies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even after he earned a seat on the influential House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees that industry. Still, for his first few years in Congress, Mr. Collins attracted little attention outside New York. That changed in 2016, when Mr. Collins endorsed Mr. Trump, holding up their shared business backgrounds as the reason. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need a chief executive, not a chief politician,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Collins said, recycling one of his own campaign slogans. Some saw yet more self-promotion. Carl Paladino, another businessman-turned-politician who ran as the Republican candidate for New York governor in 2010, pointed out that Mr. Collins had first endorsed Jeb Bush. But Mr. Bush fizzled, and Mr. Paladino \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an early supporter of Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 urged the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican delegation to get behind his favored candidate. At first, Mr. Collins resisted, Mr. Paladino said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until I struck a chord by saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You could be the first congressman to come on board, and you could take that notoriety\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when he saw that as an opportunity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Paladino said. Mr. Collins has tried to deflect Mr. Paladino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim that he was coaxed into the endorsement. But he clearly had no qualms about the national profile that followed. He bragged to his eye doctor about receiving direct phone calls from Mr. Trump, and touted his invitation to a private lunch after the inauguration. He earned parodies on late-night comedy shows. There were more tangible political rewards, too. In November 2016, Paul Ryan, then the House speaker, asked Mr. Collins to second his renomination to the speakership, as a sign of good will toward Mr. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cObviously the Trump election highlighted his profile,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Representative Tom Reed, a Republican whose district borders Mr. Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former one, said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I think it was clear he enjoyed that role.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But with visibility came scrutiny of a kind that Mr. Collins had until then largely avoided. In January 2017, when Mr. Trump nominated Representative Tom Price, another outspoken supporter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and a friend of Mr. Collins \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to serve as secretary of health and human services, that friendship became a key focus of Mr. Price\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Senate confirmation hearings. After The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Price had significant holdings in health care companies, Democrats homed in on one investment in particular: Innate Immunotherapeutics, a little-known Australian drug company that had several congressional investors. By far the largest investor was Mr. Collins, who owned almost one-fifth of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock and also sat on its board of directors. His son and daughter were also among the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top 20 shareholders. But Mr. Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ties to Innate went far beyond a title or even mere trading. Not long after meeting Innate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive, Simon Wilkinson, in 2005, Mr. Collins raised $6 million for his company in 96 hours, he told Congressional investigators in 2017. Several times, when the company couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make payroll, he provided loans. He was also perhaps its most fervent evangelist, openly boasting at the Capitol that he had convinced friends and acquaintances to buy into Innate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know how many millionaires I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made in Buffalo the past few months?\u00e2\u0080\u009d a reporter once overheard him say. Mr. Reed said some of the promotion seemed to stem from genuine passion for the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt times, it came across as he was very excited about what this was going to do for patients,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut then, obviously, some members, myself included, were a little bit uncomfortable with some of the commentary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At Mr. Price\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confirmation hearing, Democrats, noting that Mr. Price had bought between $60,000 and $110,000 of Innate stock, demanded to know how he had come by the investment. They asked whether he had been given inside information by Mr. Collins. Both men denied any impropriety. But the accusations quickly turned into a sprawling ethics inquiry. Government watchdog groups and a Democratic congresswoman wrote letters asking for investigations to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of Congressional Ethics and federal prosecutors in Manhattan. They noted that Mr. Collins had written bill language to speed up drug trials \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a change that could benefit Innate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 shortly before buying more Innate stock. Mr. Collins had also visited the National Institutes of Health soon after being elected, where he pressed a researcher to help Innate with a drug trial, a complaint said. In response to the accusations, Mr. Collins often echoed the president who had brought him into the limelight in the first place. He called The Buffalo News, which broke the story of the congressional ethics investigation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfake news,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he attacked the investigations as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwitch hunt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He called the Democratic congresswoman, Louise Slaughter, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdespicable human being.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Mr. Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eventual downfall was ultimately related not to political entanglements, but to his family. Barely two weeks after the congressional ethics interview on June 5, 2017, Mr. Collins was at the congressional picnic, when he received an email from the chief executive of Innate. The email said that Innate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drug trial for its only product, a much-anticipated drug to cure multiple sclerosis, had failed. In a panic, Mr. Collins called his son, Cameron Collins, to share the news \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0a violation of federal securities law, which prohibits sharing a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confidential information for personal gain. Within days, Cameron Collins sold more than one million shares of Innate stock, allowing him to avoid more than $570,000 in losses. About a year later, in August 2018, Mr. Collins and his son were indicted, along with the father of Cameron Collins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fianc\u00c3\u00a9e. Even then, Mr. Collins remained defiant. After suspending his re-election campaign briefly after his indictment, he restarted it weeks later, going on to defeat the Democratic challenger, Nate McMurray, by less than half a percentage point. Some Republican leaders urged him to not run again in 2020, but Mr. Collins offered no hints of stepping down. So when a court filing suddenly appeared last week with the news that Mr. Collins planned to change his \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot guilty plea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it caught his allies by surprise. Within hours, he had resigned. After the hearing, Mr. Collins and his lawyers refused to say why he had agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and lying to federal investigators. He faces up to 10 years in prison, but prosecutors and defense lawyers have agreed to seek a sentence between 46 months and 57 months. But Mr. Collins had seemingly predicted the effect Innate would have on his legacy \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0if not in the way he imagined. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf all the things I will accomplish in my life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told congressional investigators of his investments in Innate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis will be No. 1 on my tombstone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "SAN ANTONIO \u00e2\u0080\u0094 When Rosie Castro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sons, Juli\u00c3\u00a1n and Joaquin, were still in elementary school, she took them to countless political meetings in San Antonio, hoping they would learn to see the world as she did: a place that needed Mexican-American voices, like theirs, fighting for representation in the upper echelons of power. A place that needed them to speak with urgency about civil rights and racism. Her sons wholly embraced the lesson about political power \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they both ran for and won elected office in their 20s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but they were never quite as fierce as all the Chicano activists they had spent time with as children, rarely using the language of their mother and her political friends. Then came President Trump. With Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pitch to voters relying on attacks on Mexicans and immigrants, Mr. Castro has abandoned any reluctance to use the vocabulary of activists, increasingly speaking in terms that have surprised even his mother. On Monday, he traveled to Matamoros, Mexico, where hundreds of asylum seekers, in limbo under the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cremain in Mexico\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy for migrants, have created a tent city. He crossed into Brownsville, Tex., with a dozen people who were asking for an exception to that policy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 people who he said were either disabled or victims of assault because of their sexuality or gender identity. The 12 asylum seekers spoke with border officials for three hours, and then were turned away. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt only made me more confident that this policy is born out of cruelty, to force these people to self-deport back to wherever they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come from,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Castro said in an interview Monday evening. Reflecting on his maternal grandmother, who immigrated from Mexico in the 1920s as a 7-year-old orphan, he added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see in the children my grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, and I know that there is potentially a life that can be saved or changed forever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am living that directly right now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The visit and his comments echo the tenor of his 2020 campaign, where he has taken stances on health care and immigration, including decriminalizing illegal border crossings, that would have been shunned by much of the Democratic Party just four years ago. For Mr. Castro and other second- and third-generation immigrants, who came of age as Latinos seemed to be gaining political, cultural and economic influence, the Trump era has been a stunning reminder that attacks on people who look like them resonate loudly among people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that all of those gains may be elusive. In interviews, Latino politicians across the country said that, for the first time in their lifetimes, it feels as though their Americanness is being called into question. The mass shooting in El Paso this summer, in which the gunman said he had targeted Mexicans living in the border city, underscored that fear and anger. Mr. Castro said, in an interview last month, that he senses a great deal of anxiety remaining after that attack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an urgency we need to respond with,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a president attacking Latinos and immigrants. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a real sense of going back, so of course I need to address that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But in a community as diverse as Latinos in the United States, there is not universal agreement. A small but vocal minority of Hispanics are steadfast supporters of Mr. Trump and dismiss any suggestion that he has encouraged racist attacks with his rhetoric. Recent polls of Latino voters show, however, that the overwhelming majority believe they are facing increasing threats and view racism as a pressing issue. A Univision poll showed that 87 percent of Latinos who are registered to vote view racism as a significant issue, the highest percentage in nearly a decade, and some 66 percent of voters surveyed said they were \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery worried\u00e2\u0080\u009d there would be another mass shooting \u00e2\u0080\u009ctargeting people based on race or country of origin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Castro, now 72, once urged a reporter not to confuse her sons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 politics with hers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she was more radical. But during the September debate, she was pleased by Mr. Castro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aggressiveness, and hopes it is a tone that he sticks with, especially in the debate next week. She grew up at a time when Mexican-Americans were banned from living in certain neighborhoods in her native San Antonio, and restaurants hung signs that read \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo dogs or Mexicans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Drawing lessons from the civil rights movement, Chicano activists in the 1960s and \u00e2\u0080\u009970s staged protests and walkouts throughout the Southwest, demanding access to better housing, education and political power. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring my own time and the time of the \u00e2\u0080\u009960s, for me much of what I did came out of anger \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it was just a raw deal for our people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that with my sons, there is no need to come out of anger. They come out of an educated place, an experienced place \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not to say that they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get angry, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming out of an understanding how public policy is made and in a strategic way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She then quickly added, of the current president: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou got a man who took everything and turned it on its head. Is there more of a reason to be angry? Of course. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking about us and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking about our people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Castro is the only Latino candidate in the 2020 presidential race, and in recent weeks he has seemed to lean into this role: His campaign has posted images on social media of him in a thumping lowrider, calling for a country with taco trucks on every corner and selling Chicano tattoo-inspired merchandise. Still, he is careful not to be pigeonholed by his ethnic identity, even if he is eager to take on the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rhetoric. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being called on to speak to these issues, because of Trump, because of what he has said and done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Castro said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a characterization of us as other, as not belonging. This has been a turning point for Latinos because you have such high profile scapegoating so bluntly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When he was a member of President Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cabinet, Mr. Castro rarely spoke out on immigration and did not take a public stance against the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach. By contrast, during his presidential campaign, he has repeatedly criticized the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deportation policies, saying he has \u00e2\u0080\u009clearned from those mistakes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On the campaign trail, Mr. Castro appears confident, eager to project an image as a polite but steadfast warrior for his liberal positions. But even as he courts left-leaning primary voters, polls have consistently shown that he is struggling to build a base of support. He has not yet qualified for the November debate and has suggested he may drop out if he does not make the stage. As a child in the 1970s, Mr. Castro spent hours with his mother and her friends, Chicano activists in a deeply divided South Texas. Frustrated by the lack of attention from local Democrats, Ms. Castro and her friends eventually formed a third party, La Raza Unida, in an effort to get Chicanos elected to public office. Ms. Castro ran for City Council as one of the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidates. She lost, but her twin sons went on to unquestionable success, enrolling at Stanford University as undergraduates, then at Harvard Law School and eventually reaching the highest echelons in politics: Mr. Castro was appointed to Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cabinet, while his brother, Joaquin Castro, serves in Congress. During the 1990s and 2000s, while the Castros were pursuing their political ambitions, there were significant improvements for many Latinos: more attended college, more were elected to public office, more gained economic and cultural power. During his time on the San Antonio City Council and as mayor, in a city which is now 60 percent Latino, Mr. Castro maintained a reputation as a reserved pragmatist \u00e2\u0080\u0094 very different from the kind of activist politics his mother adopted for decades. Like his peers, he built a career that was shaped not only by where he had come from but also by the opportunities he had been able to access. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were all part of that first generation who had access to opportunity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lorena Gonzalez, a California state legislator who attended Stanford around the same time as Mr. Castro. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we suffered from our own privilege \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we can have all these degrees, we can all go to law school, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still seen as a Mexican who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t belong here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Many in the Latino community did feel a brief sense of progress and optimism after the election of Mr. Obama, who promised immigration reform during his first months in office, said Representative Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Arizona who graduated from Harvard and served in the Marines. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere were all these anti-immigrant laws, and there was a hesitancy among many Hispanics to say it was racist or had racist intent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Gallego said, referring in particular to Arizona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2010 law, which required law enforcement officers to determine an individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immigration status during a stop or an arrest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a big evolution with the Hispanic community openly attacked \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a lot of us realize that it has nothing to do with immigration, but it has to do with skin color.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lou Correa, a Democrat who has represented Orange County, Calif., in Congress since 2017, and considers himself a moderate, said that in his two decades in politics, he has \u00e2\u0080\u009cnever felt comfortable with any label other than American,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and has \u00e2\u0080\u009calways resisted being labeled the Mexican candidate and Latino.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now, even in his district where 66 percent of residents are Hispanic, he finds himself \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving to justify the presence of Mexicans and Latinos in this country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start this fight, we were called out to fight when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re told immigrants are criminals, so all of the sudden it is something we must do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fight that Ms. Castro is pleased to see her son taking on as a presidential hopeful. When she talks about his campaign, she can hardly hold back her inner activist and stage mom. She has often bristled at the fact that both of her sons are expected to answer questions about immigration, but are sometimes ignored on education or health care. After each debate, she has one piece of feedback on how Mr. Castro did: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he gets enough questions asked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Later this week, she will get to answer some questions herself. Decades after she brought her young sons to political rallies and meetings, Ms. Castro now attends them on her sons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behalf. On Wednesday, she will make her first foray outside of Texas, campaigning for Mr. Castro in three-day swing through Iowa \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the perfect job for a stage mom and veteran political activist.",

      "content": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. Democracy is officially up for sale. The domain name Democracy.com is being auctioned off this month, and it can be yours for a hefty price. The bidding, hosted by Heritage Auctions, which specializes in the sale of collectibles, begins at $300,000 and closes at 5 p.m. on Oct. 25. To the winner goes a rare piece of prime internet real estate, but the man behind the sale isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eager to let it go. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m bummed that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Talmage Cooley, who used the domain name for years to host a social platform where politicians and civics groups could communicate their positions on the issues, collect donations, announce events and otherwise connect with supporters. Mr. Cooley, an entrepreneur, started making payments on the domain name in 2012 and quickly put it to use, attracting users, press coverage and accolades, with the goal of eventually converting the civics-minded project into a business. The start-up raised $4.5 million, much of it from friends and family, but struggled in recent years to line up more substantial, institutional investment. A large crowdfunding campaign was planned for April, Mr. Cooley said, but the site ran out of money in February. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just had to call it off and that was that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Domain names, especially those composed of single words or phrases, can be incredibly expensive. In May, a blockchain company bought Voice.com for $30 million, according to the business that sold it. In 2010, a marketing company bought Insurance.com for nearly $36 million and CarInsurance.com for nearly $50 million. And then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s LasVegas.com, which was sold in 2005 in a complex, ongoing deal, which according to details outlined in a 2015 corporate filing would be worth about $90 million when and if it finally closes in 2040. (The company that purchased the domain did not respond to a request for comment on whether the deal is still in place.) But, as with any market, demand for domain names has ebbed and flowed over time as preferences have changed. Companies once fought over domains that described the services or products they sold, like shoes, but such literal names proved limiting as businesses sought to expand, according to Aron Meystedt, who left Heritage Auctions a year ago but still consulted on the sale of Democracy.com (which currently redirects to the auction page). \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, the trend is get a killer one-word name, and the reason is that you can pivot into anything you want,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Meystedt, who has traded domain names for years and owns Symbolics.com, which became the first public dot-com address when it was registered in 1985. Even with years of experience, appraising the value of a domain name is difficult because their worth is so often determined by what a limited pool of buyers is willing to pay, he said. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Heritage Auctions said it had decided to sell Democracy.com in a sealed-bid auction, in which each potential buyer is blind to what others have offered. Unlike an open auction, in which the winner only has to bid slightly more than the second-highest bidder, sealed-bid auctions can pressure buyers to make offers closer to their own upper limits. Democracy.com was registered in the mid-1990s by Intraactive, an online business in Washington, D.C., that claimed the name on behalf of the Democratic National Committee, according to a 1997 article in the magazine In These Times. Back then, Intraactive was struggling to get rid of the domain, which the D.N.C. had never used, according to the article. But the business eventually found a buyer in John Carrieri, who said in an interview that his personal records indicated he had bought the domain name from Intraactive and that he believed the sale likely took place in or around 1998. Mr. Carrieri, now the chief executive of an energy management business in San Diego, was an early investor in domains and once owned Jokes.com, which is now in the hands of Comedy Central, and Jobs.com, now owned by Monster. But while he ran those domains as businesses, he had more idealistic goals for Democracy.com. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to spread democracy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Carrieri, who majored in history and political science in college and had planned to turn the domain into an educational resource. Ultimately, Mr. Carrieri was never able to give the project the time and resources it demanded, so he sold the domain a little more than a decade after buying it. He declined to name the buyer, citing a nondisclosure agreement that was part of the sale, but a domain name reseller announced auctions that included Democracy.com in both 2010 and 2012, the same year that Mr. Cooley said he began licensing Democracy.com from a domain name broker. Mr. Cooley soon began using it for his project, and eventually convinced an investor in the site to buy the domain outright. The investor, whom he declined to name, still owns Democracy.com and will receive a cut of the profits from this month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s auction. Mr. Cooley launched the platform, which had signed up thousands of candidates and organizations, out of frustration with what he saw as the rising influence of moneyed interests in American politics. The problem, as he saw it, was that democracy in America was for sale. Now, Democracy.com is.",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES \u00e2\u0080\u0094 When President Donald Trump suggested earlier this year that American Jews who vote for Democrats are disloyal, one 2020 Democratic presidential candidate chose to respond in Hebrew. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know Jewish values,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senator Cory Booker told a group of reporters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTzedakah, chesed\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cthose are ideas about justice and decency and kindness and mercy. We need to get back to those values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He then went on to quote a prayer said during the Jewish High Holy Days to further make his case. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKi beyti beit tefila yikarei l\u00e2\u0080\u0099kol ha\u00e2\u0080\u0099amim,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in slightly Yiddish-inflected Hebrew. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098May my house be a house of prayer for many nations,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what is said at the most important time of year, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we need to get back to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Booker, who is Christian, will not be uttering those words in synagogue this Yom Kippur, which begins Tuesday at sundown, but it has not stopped him from speaking them frequently as he runs for president. When a minister asked Mr. Booker, during a televised CNN town hall in March, how his faith would shape his time in the White House, the senator referred to the same verse. Raised in the black Baptist church since childhood, Mr. Booker has proudly spoken of his Christian faith. He has been just as outspoken in his pride about his Jewish knowledge, quoting Hebrew phrases and Talmudic passages with as much frequency as verses from the Christian Bible. In a television interview after the Democratic debate in Houston last month, Mr. Booker said \u00e2\u0080\u009cthank God, Baruch Hashem, they were doing multilingual tonight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The clip was quickly made into a meme \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Mr. Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager himself used it to post word that his candidate had qualified for the November debate. If it strikes voters as somewhat unusual to hear an African-American Christian effortlessly using Hebrew, that might be precisely the point. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy faith is my foundation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Booker, whose style of oratory can come close to that of a charismatic youth pastor, said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any other religion I know as well as mine, it would be Judaism by far. Judaism deeply spoke to me because it was the marrying of a sort an intellectual discipline with spiritual discipline in a way that really ignited my moral imagination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For years, Senator Booker has nurtured close relationships with Jewish leaders, particularly rabbis, so much so that, he said, his inbox is now regularly peppered with religious writings, sent to him to peruse on whatever downtime he has. He has received an honorary degree from Yeshiva University, officiated at a handful of Jewish weddings, keeps a copy of the Jewish Bible on his desk and has attended a Passover Seder every year for decades. (Though he did miss it this year; Iowa beckoned.) As a child in Harrington Park, N.J., a New York suburb with a sizable Jewish population, Mr. Booker attended several bar and bat mitzvahs. And having studied the Old Testament in church, he was well acquainted with the basic contours of the Exodus from Egypt. Not long after he arrived at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar in 1992, Mr. Booker met Shmuley Boteach, an American rabbi who had been sent to the campus as an emissary for the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, which places an emphasis on outreach to nonpracticing Jews. Mr. Booker eventually became a president of the L\u00e2\u0080\u0099Chaim Society, a Jewish campus group that Rabbi Boteach created, which functioned as a kind of salon and dining club for students. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo say that we were close is really an understatement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rabbi Boteach said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were the way two brothers are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was an uncle to my children, he was my confidant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The two worked on a book together about their relationship and tried to have it made into a feature film, but the idea was eventually shelved after a screenwriter told them there was not enough conflict for a movie. That was before the rabbi and the senator had a major falling out over what Mr. Booker said was a personal matter and that Rabbi Boteach blames on the senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vote in favor of a nuclear deal with Iran. Though Rabbi Boteach now criticizes Mr. Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hebrew citations as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cparlor trick,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they are warmly welcomed by many Jews, from the Orthodox to secular. (Many of Mr. Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jewish donors say, only half-jokingly, that he knows more about the religious tradition than they do.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a twinkle that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming from his soul,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rabbi Shmully Hecht, with whom Mr. Booker worked to create a Jewish group at Yale. He also criticized Mr. Booker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vote on Iran, but considers him a steadfast supporter of Israel.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you see him talking about Jewish things and Israel things, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extraordinary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rabbi Menachem Genack, who leads the kosher certifying division of the Orthodox Union and lives in Englewood, N.J., met Mr. Booker through Rabbi Boteach more than two decades ago and has considered him a friend ever since. Rabbi Genack, who published a book of his letters to former President Bill Clinton, said it is often Mr. Booker who brings up Torah in their conversations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI go to his office and I start talking Abraham Lincoln and he starts talking about the parsha,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Genack, using the Hebrew term for the weekly Torah portion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI say: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Cory, what is wrong with this picture?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and he just laughs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Several years ago, Rabbi Genack brought the chief rabbi of Israel to meet Mr. Booker at his office. Soon after the conversation began, Mr. Booker pulled out a special coin of Rebbe Menachem Schneerson, the founder of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. He said that he kept it in his pocket for years as kind of a talisman, but after a few scares, he began leaving it on his bedside nightstand. Now, he carries a blue index card with a quote from the prophet Isaiah. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they who trust in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they shall run and not grow weary, they shall walk and not grow faint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ever ecumenical, he also keeps a saint card, with a prayer written in Spanish. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think of Cory as Jew-ish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles who was a Rhodes Scholar with Mr. Booker, and spent time with him at the L\u00e2\u0080\u0099Chaim Society, where Mr. Booker would regularly share his insights on Jewish texts. (Mr. Garcetti, who is Jewish, now regularly studies with a rabbi himself.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a thread in the fabric that sustains him. Civil rights history and the Talmud are two main pillars of his moral universe. He understands the Jewish base of Christianity, of how Jews were such critical figures in the civil rights movement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Booker has frequently spoken about how a Jewish lawyer helped his parents settle in what was an overwhelmingly white suburb. He said he does not see his interest in Judaism as in conflict with his own faith, and instead has used it to deepen his own private prayer. Mr. Booker has never indicated any interest in converting, said Noah Feldman, now a law professor at Harvard, who has been close with the senator since their time at Oxford and later at Yale Law School, where the two helped create another Jewish student organization. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere were people in our orbit who said to him, \u00e2\u0080\u0098This is not how you want to be spending your time. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you take the lead in the African diaspora group?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Feldman said. Mr. Booker said that the Rev. David Jefferson Sr. was \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy pastor in every sense of the word.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, he added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do get spiritual guidance and influence from many people and many people that I see from different faith traditions. But I definitely feel I lean heavily on Jewish friends of mine who really do know me and know what my morality is about and feed me, especially in this time. They really do source me with a gospel, so to speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During a campaign stop in Boone, Iowa on Tuesday, a gusty wind blew open double doors behind where Mr. Booker was standing, just as he was getting into his stump speech. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the spirit of Elijah, coming into the room here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he joked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good sign!\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The White House declared war on the House impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, announcing that it would not cooperate with what it called an illegitimate effort \u00e2\u0080\u009cto overturn the results of the 2016 election\u00e2\u0080\u009d and setting the stage for a constitutional clash with far-reaching consequences. In a letter to House Democratic leaders, the White House said the inquiry had violated precedent and denied President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s due process rights in such an egregious way that neither he nor the executive branch would willingly provide testimony or documents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the letter signed by Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the executive branch and all future occupants of the office of the presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But in refusing to cooperate with what Mr. Trump on Tuesday called a \u00e2\u0080\u009ckangaroo court,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the president risked ensuring the very outcome he would rather avoid. House Democrats made clear that his failure to comply with their demands for information could form the basis for its own article of impeachment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The letter came shortly after the White House blocked the interview of a key witness, Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, just hours before he was to appear on Capitol Hill. A senior administration official said no other witnesses or documents would be provided, putting a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfull halt\u00e2\u0080\u009d to cooperation. The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to resist across the board is itself a potentially precedent-setting move that could have far-reaching implications for the inquiry. Democrats believe that it bolsters their list of impeachable offenses, adding the stonewalling of Congress to the tally, but it could also deprive them of crucial witnesses and evidence they might need to lodge credible charges against the president. It came after days of confusion, uncertainty and debate inside the White House and among Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies about his strategy as investigators dig into his efforts to pressure Ukraine to provide damaging information about his domestic rivals. Only last week, Mr. Trump publicly vowed to participate in the inquiry, saying that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI always cooperate\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work together\u00e2\u0080\u009d with Democrats, even though he considered the allegations against him to be meritless. He reversed himself after investigators were given text messages that called into question his assertion that there was no quid pro quo when he pressed Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president to investigate Democrats while dangling a White House invitation and withholding American security assistance. The decision to block Mr. Sondland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony frustrated some House Republicans. A group of them visited the president earlier Tuesday and explained why they hoped to hear from Mr. Sondland, a person briefed on the meeting said, in part because he has already denied any quid pro quo. As Mr. Trump braced for a full-fledged battle, he had lunch on Tuesday with Trey Gowdy, a former South Carolina congressman who has been in talks about joining the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal team. An administration official said Mr. Gowdy, who led the House inquiry into American deaths in Benghazi, Libya, while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, had agreed to represent Mr. Trump, but two others involved in the matter said it was not a done deal. Republicans made clear they would not simply rest on defense but would mount a counteroffensive on Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he would invite Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer who was deeply involved in the pressure campaign on Ukraine, to testify before his panel. Democrats did not flinch at the suggestion. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, Mr. Graham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic counterpart on the committee, said she looked forward to questioning \u00e2\u0080\u009cRudy Giuliani under oath about his role in seeking the Ukrainian government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistance to investigate one of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political rivals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In an interview, Mr. Giuliani said he had not decided whether to appear before Mr. Graham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s committee but would probably follow the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead and refuse to cooperate with House Democrats. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the committee is a joke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the McCarthy committee on steroids. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no sensitivity to civil rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The White House letter to Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats was part constitutional argument, part political statement. Over eight pages, Mr. Cipollone listed various ways House Democrats have diverged from precedents set during impeachment inquiries against Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton. Among other things, both of those inquiries were authorized by a vote of the full House, while Ms. Pelosi has opted against holding such a vote that might expose some of her more endangered members and instead simply declared by her own fiat that an impeachment inquiry was underway. As a result, Mr. Cipollone noted, the minority Republicans did not have subpoena power to call their own witnesses. He also noted that the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers were not allowed to participate in the questioning of witnesses, which so far has been taking place behind closed doors rather than in open session. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany Democrats now apparently view impeachment not only as a means to undo the democratic results of the last election, but as a strategy to influence the next election, which is barely more than a year away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cipollone wrote. While Mr. Cipollone was correct that in some ways Ms. Pelosi is handling impeachment differently than her Nixon and Clinton-era predecessors, it is not clear that she has any constitutional obligation to follow those precedents. The Constitution says that the House \u00e2\u0080\u009cshall have the sole power of impeachment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but provides no process or rules, meaning each House that has considered it has proceeded as it chose to. For her part, Ms. Pelosi preferred on Tuesday to focus on another precedent that she might follow. One of the three articles of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee against Mr. Nixon in 1974 charged him with high crimes for failing to provide information during the inquiry. Ms. Pelosi was not ready to say whether she will follow suit, but left the door open. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president is obstructing Congress from getting the facts that we need,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told reporters in Seattle, where she was holding an unrelated event. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is an abuse of power for him to act in this way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even before the White House released its letter, Mr. Trump signaled his defiance on Tuesday, ridiculing the inquiry as spurious. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the president wrote on Twitter Tuesday morning around the time Mr. Sondland was to appear, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights have been taken away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Catch up on all the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s news here.] The decision to block Mr. Sondland from being interviewed was delivered at the last minute, after the ambassador had already flown to Washington from Europe, and lawmakers had returned from a two-week recess to observe the questioning. Mr. Sondland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers told House staff members that a State Department official left a voice mail message at 12:30 a.m. directing him not to appear. Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters that the State Department was also withholding text messages Mr. Sondland had sent on a private device that were \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeeply relevant\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the inquiry. By the end of the day, House leaders issued a subpoena ordering Mr. Sondland to appear next Wednesday and turn over documents before then. Mr. Sondland, a wealthy hotelier and contributor to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, has become a central figure in the saga of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to seek political help from Ukraine. Although Ukraine is not in the European Union, Mr. Trump instructed Mr. Sondland to take a lead in his administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with the country. Mr. Sondland interacted directly with Mr. Trump, speaking with the president several times around key moments that House Democrats are now investigating, including before and after Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. The president asked Mr. Zelensky in that conversation to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo us a favor\u00e2\u0080\u009d and investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and conspiracy theories about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election. Text messages provided to Congress last week showed that Mr. Sondland and another senior diplomat worked with Mr. Giuliani on language for a statement for the Ukrainian president to put out in August that would have committed him to the investigations sought by Mr. Trump. The statement was seen as critical to getting Mr. Trump to agree to a coveted White House visit sought by Mr. Zelensky. The texts also showed that the top American diplomat based in Ukraine believed that Mr. Trump was holding up $391 million in security aid as leverage for persuading Ukraine to conduct the investigations Mr. Trump wanted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d William B. Taylor Jr., the diplomat, wrote in early September. After receiving the text, Mr. Sondland called Mr. Trump, who asserted it was false. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intentions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sondland wrote in the messages. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of any kind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sondland added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There have been conflicting accounts of Mr. Sondland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s views, however. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, told The Wall Street Journal last week that Mr. Sondland told him in August that the release of the aid was contingent upon Ukraine opening the investigations. Mr. Johnson said he was alarmed and asked Mr. Trump if there was a quid pro quo involved. The president adamantly denied it, he said. Robert D. Luskin, Mr. Sondland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer, said in a statement that as a State Department employee, his client had no choice but to comply with the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction. He said Mr. Sondland was \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofoundly disappointed\u00e2\u0080\u009d he was not able to testify, and would do so in the future if allowed. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies on Capitol Hill condemned Mr. Schiff for running what they described as an unfair process, but made clear they believed Mr. Sondland would have been a helpful witness for the president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were looking forward to hearing from Ambassador Sondland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight and Reform Committee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we understand exactly why the administration, exactly why the State Department has chosen to say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Look, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be this kind of process \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Jordan added.",

      "content": "[Sign up to get this Impeachment Briefing in your email inbox every weeknight.] The showdown today felt like the most dramatic clash yet between the branches of government. Are we in what some might call a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconstitutional crisis\u00e2\u0080\u009d? Amy Fiscus, our national security editor, answered that question for me between conversations with her reporters about pursuing leads. Even some Republicans have privately been urging Mr. Trump to cooperate with the impeachment investigation. I stopped by the desk of my colleague Annie Karni, who covers the White House, to ask her about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defiance. Annie, you and Maggie Haberman wrote about anxiety in the West Wing over how to handle impeachment. Why has the president concluded that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better not to cooperate? This is not a criminal investigation, like the Mueller investigation was. This is a political process. And they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaning heavily into that idea with the eight-page letter the White House counsel sent tonight. We also see that in the polls: How people view Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions and the actions of House Democrats is split by party. We also already know how this story almost certainly ends: Mr. Trump is not going to be convicted by the Senate. Does it matter for him whether there are one or two charges? His, and the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, calculation is: no. But isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that kind of resistance just going to harden Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 belief that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some kind of cover-up? Some witnesses could be really bad for the president, so the White House wants to have a broad position that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to play along. There were differing opinions internally about the case of Sondland, who some people thought would have had a story to tell that would have been helpful to Trump. But they ultimately decided \u00e2\u0080\u0094 really late at night \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that their position was about something broader. Remember when they decided to release the transcript of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president? In that case, they clearly made the opposite calculation: Looking like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hiding something is worse than the facts in the transcript, which were pretty bad. Now, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve basically decided that looking like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hiding something is better than looking like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cooperating with what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re calling an illegitimate investigation. House Democrats have only had one witness so far, Kurt Volker, and look how much House Democrats got! They have in writing that there could have been a quid pro quo. What else could they find with even just one more?",

      "subtitle": "In blacklisting surveillance companies, the United States is the first major government to punish China for its crackdown on Muslims.",
      "author": "Paul Mozur",
      "content": "SHANGHAI \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The world has largely sat by for nearly two years as China detained more than one million people, mostly Muslims and members of minority ethnic groups, in internment camps to force them to embrace the Communist Party. Now, the Trump administration is taking the first public steps by a major world government toward punishing Beijing. In doing so, it is opening up a new front in the already worsening relationship between Washington and Beijing: human rights and the dystopian world of digital surveillance. Trump administration officials on Monday placed eight Chinese companies and a number of police departments on a blacklist that forbids them to buy American-made technology like microchips, software and other vital components. The companies are at the vanguard of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surveillance and artificial intelligence ambitions, with many of them selling increasingly sophisticated systems used by governments to track people. The White House cited their business in Xinjiang, a region of northwestern China that is home to a largely Muslim minority group known as the Uighurs. The United States government says more than one million ethnic Uighurs and other minorities have been locked in detention camps there. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced visa restrictions on Chinese officials believed to be involved in the detention or abuse of Muslim ethnic minorities. The announcements suggest that the Trump administration is increasingly willing to listen to the advice of American officials focused on the strategic challenges posed by China and who are concerned about its human rights abuses, even if President Trump himself never seems to pay much attention to those. The restrictions were announced just two days before American and Chinese officials were set to begin a 13th round of trade talks, most likely putting a chill over the negotiations. More broadly, the White House, in its blacklist announcement, signaled a willingness to take aim at China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technological dreams. China has plowed billions of dollars into companies developing advanced hardware and software to catch up with the United States. Some of the companies added to the list on Monday are among the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most valuable artificial intelligence start-ups. Much of that technology \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including facial recognition and computer vision \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can be used to track people. That includes smartphone tracking, voice-pattern identification and systems that track individuals across cities through powerful cameras. Washington officials have grown increasingly worried about China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambitions to export its systems elsewhere, including places known for human rights abuses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an important first step in making some of the companies that have benefited the most from the re-education system in Xinjiang feel the consequences of their actions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Washington who studies the plight of the Uighurs. He said the move signaled that abuse of minority groups in Xinjiang \u00e2\u0080\u009cis real and justifies a political and economic response.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is also a potentially groundbreaking use of a powerful tool that the American government typically uses against terrorists. The Chinese companies and police departments were placed on what is called an entity list, which forbids them to buy sensitive American exports unless Washington grants American companies specific permission to sell to them. Use of the entity list over a human rights issue may be a first, said Julian Ku, a professor of constitutional and international law at Hofstra University. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs far as I know, it was the first time Commerce explicitly cited human rights as a foreign policy interest of the U.S. for purposes of export controls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, referring to the Department of Commerce, which manages the entity lists. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not an implausible reading of the regulations, but it is new and has potentially very broad applicability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Geng Shuang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in a briefing on Tuesday that the White House was using human rights as an excuse to punish Chinese companies. Many of the companies offer a wide array of products outside of surveillance, including medical tools that diagnose tumors, automatic translation services and even social media filters that slim the waist. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis goes against the basic principles of international relations, it interferes in China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal affairs, and it goes against China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national security,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no human rights issue in Xinjiang.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Chinese Commerce Ministry urged the United States to take the 28 companies and organizations off the entity list as soon as possible. The immediate effect on the Chinese companies is likely to be minimal, because many have stockpiled essential supplies, but they could feel increasing pain if they stay on the blacklist for months or years. Perhaps more important, it can put a cloud over the companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reputations, limiting their sales in the United States or elsewhere and keeping them from hiring the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best technology talent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe U.S. move today puts up a big roadblock on the road to internationalization,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Matt Sheehan, a fellow at MacroPolo, the think tank of the Paulson Institute. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost global technology companies are setting up labs abroad, partnering with the best universities around the world and looking to recruit top talent from everywhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat all just got a lot harder now that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re marked with the scarlet letter of the entity list.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The move followed more than a year of internal debate over how to punish China for its persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang. Senior officials on the National Security Council and in the State Department have pushed for the use of the entity list to target Chinese companies supplying surveillance technology to the security forces in Xinjiang. They have also urged Mr. Trump to approve sanctions that would penalize Chinese officials and companies involved in the abuses. But top American trade negotiators, including the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have cautioned against policies that would upset trade talks. Mr. Trump has said he wants to reach a trade deal with China. Until now, other top officials, most notably Mr. Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence, have denounced China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies in Xinjiang but not enacted punitive measures. This month, American customs officials blocked products from a Chinese garment maker in Xinjiang, but they had held off on stronger action. The Chinese companies on the list include Hikvision, a major maker of surveillance cameras, and the well-funded artificial intelligence start-ups SenseTime and Megvii. SenseTime said it set \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh ethical standards for A.I. technologies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while Megvii said it required \u00e2\u0080\u009cclients not to weaponize our technology or solutions or use them for illegal purposes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It added that it had generated no revenue from within Xinjiang in the first half of 2019. New York Times reporting showed that four of the companies on the list \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Yitu, Hikvision, Megvii and SenseTime \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0helped build systems across China that sought to use facial recognition to automate the detection of Uighurs. Government procurement documents, company marketing materials and official government releases tied all eight companies to various business operations and sales in Xinjiang. The many local Xinjiang police bureaus on the list buy commercial American technology like Intel microchips and Microsoft Windows software, according to procurement documents. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next step could be imposing sanctions on specific Chinese officials working in Xinjiang. Among the officials discussed is Chen Quanguo, a Politburo member who is the party chief in Xinjiang and an architect of the system of internment camps and surveillance. The blacklist action is a sign that strategic China hawks have become even more influential in the administration in recent weeks. Matthew Pottinger, the senior director for Asia and an architect of policies aimed at countering China, was promoted to deputy national security adviser last month. Earlier, Robert O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien, the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top hostage negotiator, replaced John R. Bolton as national security adviser. Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien has written that China poses an enormous challenge to the United States. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis Xinjiang package has been in the works now for months,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Samm Sacks, a cybersecurity policy fellow at New America, a think tank. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo the fact that it comes out now just ahead of the next round of trade talks sends a signal from those in the administration who want no deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo far, Beijing has been quite measured in its response to the U.S. government,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat probably is over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 It is one of Elizabeth Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signature anecdotes in her stump speech: By the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cvisibly pregnant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the principal wished her luck and hired another teacher to replace her. In recent days, a conservative news site and other outlets have cited evidence that challenges her account, including past remarks by Ms. Warren in which she did not mention being forced to leave the school and minutes from a school board meeting showing that her contract was initially extended for the next school year. Ms. Warren is now pushing back against any suggestion that she has misrepresented the circumstances of her departure, and pointing to the discrimination that many pregnant women have faced on the job. The school board did extend her contract early in her pregnancy, before the school knew about it, she said in an interview with CBS News. But two months later, when it was clear that she was pregnant, she lost the job. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I was 22 and finishing my first year of teaching, I had an experience millions of women will recognize,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy June I was visibly pregnant \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the principal told me the job I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d already been promised for the next year would go to someone else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Warren did not name the principal in her tweets. News accounts show that the principal at the time was Edward Pruzinsky. He died in 1999. Ms. Warren has frequently cited her experience with pregnancy discrimination as she has laid out her political biography to voters, explaining why she went from a public-school teaching career into law and eventually politics, and how her professional development was affected by a form of workplace bias that many women encounter. Historically, it was common for American teachers to be pushed out of their jobs during pregnancy, either through termination or the requirement of an unpaid leave of absence. In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled some of these policies unconstitutional. But not all such policies were explicitly written down and tracked, giving many female teachers little legal recourse. CBS News quoted a retired teacher from Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school, Trudy Randall, who suggested Ms. Warren would have been unwelcome at the school given her pregnancy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Randall was quoted as saying. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At issue are the circumstances that brought to an end Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brief career as a special needs teacher at an elementary school in Riverdale, N.J., where she worked from 1970 to 1971, when she was just out of college. On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal story is a central part of her stump speech, beginning with her upbringing in Oklahoma and, eventually, her experience as a teacher. As Ms. Warren tells it, she had wanted to be a teacher since she was in second grade. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI loved that work, and I would probably still be doing that work today, but my story has some more turns,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told a crowd in Nevada last week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant, and the principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She included a similar account in her 2014 memoir. In some retellings earlier this year, she said the principal \u00e2\u0080\u009cshowed me the door.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a post on Twitter last week, Meagan Day, a writer for the socialist magazine Jacobin, drew attention to an interview Ms. Warren gave in 2007 in which she discussed the end of her career as a public-school teacher and did not describe being forced out because she was pregnant. Ms. Warren recalled going back to school because she lacked the education courses she needed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this is going to work out for me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Warren said in the interview. Addressing the differences in her accounts, Ms. Warren said in a statement to CBS News, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life and this was one of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Monday, a conservative website, The Washington Free Beacon, published minutes from meetings of the Riverdale Board of Education that referred to her employment status. Minutes of a meeting on April 21, 1971, show that the board approved the issuance of a contract for Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMrs. Elizabeth Warren \u00e2\u0080\u0094 2 days per week, Speech,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the minutes say. Ms. Warren told CBS News that she had been hiding her pregnancy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was pregnant, but nobody knew it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then a couple of months later when I was six months pregnant and it was pretty obvious, the principal called me in, wished me luck and said he was going to hire someone else for the job.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Minutes of another school board meeting on June 16, 1971, say that Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resignation, effective June 30, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas accepted with regret.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first child, Amelia, was born that September. The Republican National Committee said Tuesday that Ms. Warren had been \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaught lying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pregnancy discrimination can begin as soon as women reveal they are pregnant, or are visibly showing, and can continue to affect them for years. In physically demanding jobs, pregnant women risk being fired if they ask to take rest breaks, and in the corporate world, women and mothers may be steered away from prestigious assignments or excluded from client meetings if a boss perceives them to be less committed to their work than other employees. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, wrote on Twitter about Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis happened to women ALL the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, which made it illegal to treat pregnant women differently from other people \u00e2\u0080\u009csimilar in their ability or inability to work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the law did not solve the problem. Employers argued successfully in court that pregnant workers were comparable to people who got injured off the job, and did not deserve to be accommodated. Although many American companies have made efforts to become more welcoming to women and retain mothers, pregnancy discrimination remains widespread. Joan C. Williams, the founding director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, called it the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrongest form of gender discrimination there is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The new head of the International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade war with China could cost the global economy around $700 billion by 2020 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a loss equivalent to the size of Switzerland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire economy. In her first speech as managing director, Kristalina Georgieva said the global economy had shifted from a synchronized upswing two years ago to a synchronized slowdown, weighed down in part by the pain of President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade war. The fund will be downgrading its projections for global growth in 2019 and 2020 next week, when it releases new projections of the economic losses related to the trade war between the United States and China. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have spoken in the past about the dangers of trade disputes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Georgieva said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, we see that they are actually taking a toll.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The warning comes at a potential turning point in the trade conflict between the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two largest economies. American and Chinese negotiators are meeting in Washington this week to try to resolve a trade war that has begun to inflict economic pain in both countries. Negotiators are hoping to reach an agreement that would improve some of the Chinese economic practices the Trump administration has complained about and potentially roll back some of the tariffs Mr. Trump has placed on more than $360 billion of Chinese goods. The stakes for some type of resolution are high. The United States is poised to raise tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to 30 percent from 25 percent next Tuesday and plans to tax more consumer goods, including laptops, smartphones and apparel, in December. Barring an agreement, the Trump administration will tax nearly every product that the country imports from China by the year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end. In a note to investors, Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at the research firm MFR, said that the path of the American economy was partly dependent on \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical decisions regarding tariffs and other measures that are designed to force China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this very dangerous game of \u00e2\u0080\u0098chicken,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the global economy may end up as roadkill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Shapiro said. Economists have debated how much of the global economic slowdown is a result of trade tensions and how much stems from other factors, including sluggish growth in Europe and a credit slowdown in China. The Trump administration has blamed weak growth overseas, as well as a relatively tight monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. But as the trade conflict has dragged on and the United States and China have steadily expanded the lists of goods that are subject to tariffs, the costs of the trade war are becoming more evident. Major measures of consumer sentiment have dipped, with many consumers citing tariffs as a reason for their pessimism. Last week, a closely watched gauge of American manufacturing revealed that factories had slowed for the second straight month in September, while new export orders plummeted. Other countries have also suffered. German factory orders have plunged, in part because Chinese companies that have been hurt by the trade war have less money to spend on German machinery. That threatens to clamp down on German spending, which would spill over to affect other parts of the eurozone. Major international institutions have also slashed their expectations for global growth. In a report last week, the World Trade Organization halved its forecast for growth in the global trade of goods to only 1.2 percent during 2019, in what would be the weakest year since 2009. In a speech on Monday in Montreal, David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, said the institution would also be lowering its most recent forecast for global economic growth. In June, the World Bank said that it expected the global economy to grow by 2.6 percent in 2019, the slowest pace in three years. But growth this year has slowed further as a result of Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential exit from the European Union, a recession in Europe and global trade uncertainty, Mr. Malpass said. In her address, Ms. Georgieva warned that global trade growth has come to a near standstill, weighing on global manufacturing and investment. The slowdown threatens to spill over to the service sector and consumer behavior, as well, she said. She added that, even if growth picked up in 2020, trade tensions were leading to changes that might last a generation. Supply chains have been broken as companies that once manufactured products in China have tried to find alternatives in order to avoid the tariffs. And a broader fight between the United States and China over which country will dominate technologies like 5G is creating \u00e2\u0080\u009ca \u00e2\u0080\u0098digital Berlin Wall\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that forces countries to choose between technological systems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. That $700 billion loss due to the trade war with China translates to roughly 0.8 percent of global gross domestic product, she said, and includes more than $200 billion of direct losses to businesses and consumers. Much larger secondary effects from a loss of confidence and disruption to markets will also occur. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this scenario, the whole economy of Switzerland disappears,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Georgieva said. Until recently, much of the American economy had been insulated from the pain of the trade war. That is because the bulk of the economy is powered by consumption and services, unlike some smaller countries that are more exposed to shifting global winds of trade. Trade accounts for just 27 percent of the American economy, according to World Bank figures, less than China at 38 percent and Germany at 87 percent. The Trump administration has argued that the tariffs it began imposing more than a year ago are having only a limited impact on the American economy. Officials have blamed any signs of slowdown on weakness overseas, a strong United States dollar dragging on exports and the actions of the Federal Reserve, which has maintained tighter monetary conditions than many global central banks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are still suffering the aftermath of severe monetary restraint in 2018,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Larry Kudlow, one of the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top economic advisers, said in an interview on Friday on Fox Business. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the eurozone in general is in a virtual recession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But several recent studies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from academics, Wall Street researchers and the Federal Reserve \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have found varying degrees of economic damage from Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade policies, primarily through reduced business investment. Steven J. Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago who has built several indexes to measure policy uncertainty, wrote in a research paper released in August that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade uncertainty had unsettled trading partners and the global economy, contributed to depressed investment and become a major source of volatility in stock markets. Mr. Davis called those developments \u00e2\u0080\u009can extraordinary departure from recent history\u00e2\u0080\u009d for American trade policy. In another recent study, Fed economists estimated that trade policy uncertainty reduced the level of investment in the United States by at least 1 percent in 2018, which equates to several hundred billions of dollars. Goldman Sachs researchers ran a similar analysis this month, but they came to a much different conclusion. The trade war, they said in a research note, was having only \u00e2\u0080\u009cmodest\u00e2\u0080\u009d effects on investment in the United States. In a paper published Monday, Michael Waugh, a professor of economics at the New York University Leonard N. Stern School of Business, argued that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retaliatory tariffs were also having an effect on spending by Americans. The paper showed that parts of the United States that were most exposed to the tariffs China had put on American products in response to the trade war \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including the upper Midwest, the West Coast, and parts of Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Nebraska \u00e2\u0080\u0094 had also seen a drop in consumer spending on automobiles, as well as job creation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe retaliation is having real impacts on the people that are hit by it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Waugh said. Trade uncertainty has also factored prominently in the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent interest rate cuts. Fed officials reduced borrowing costs in July for the first time since the Great Recession, then followed that up with a second move in September. In both cases, Chair Jerome H. Powell cited slowing global growth and trade tensions as factors that had put central bank officials on guard by intensifying risks to the economic outlook. The question now is whether the central bank will lower rates again, or whether it views its moves so far as sufficient protection for the economy. Officials have left the door open to a cut at their late-October meeting without clearly signaling that one is coming. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrowth around much of the world has weakened over the past year and a half, and uncertainties around trade, Brexit and other issues pose risks to the outlook,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Powell said during a speech Tuesday in Denver.",

      "content": "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The commander of the American-backed militia in Syria said Tuesday that it would attack Turkish forces if they entered northeastern Syria, while Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, indicated that such an operation was imminent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will resist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mazlum Kobani, commander of the Kurdish-led militia, said in an interview with The New York Times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been at war for seven years, so we can continue the war for seven more years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Erdogan, speaking to reporters on a flight to Serbia, said the operation might happen before the news could be printed. Turkish troops were being bused to the Syrian border in preparation for an incursion, Turkish media reported. And the Turkish Defense Ministry said on Twitter that preparations to enter Syria \u00e2\u0080\u009chad been completed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The escalating challenge came after President Trump agreed to let the Turkish operation go forward and to move American troops out of the way. On Monday, American troops withdrew from posts near two Syrian towns near the border. The threat of armed resistance from the militia, a force trained and armed by the United States, raises the risks for Turkey as it weighs sending troops into Syria, and for the United States, which could find itself on the sidelines of a new front in Syria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s war \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this time between two of its allies. There was still confusion among allies and American officials about the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy as set out in seemingly contradictory statements by Mr. Trump and administration officials, and American officials said Tuesday that some senior Pentagon officials had been blindsided by the decision to pull American forces back from the border. The Kurdish-led militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., partnered with the United States to defeat the Islamic State in Syria. Since then, the militia, with American backing, has retained control of a large swath of northeastern Syria. Turkey considers the militia part of a Kurdish guerrilla movement that threatens Turkey, and Mr. Erdogan has demanded a 20-mile-deep buffer zone along the border that Turkey would control to keep back any Kurdish forces. Speaking by telephone from Syria, Mr. Kobani said he had been frustrated by the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement on Sunday that the United States would stand aside for a Turkish incursion, and that the lack of clear, predictable policies from Washington had made it hard to plan. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere should not be any ambiguity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He spoke of United States troops who had helped his forces fight the Islamic State as comrades-in-arms and said any rupture in that partnership could destabilize the region. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe fought with U.S. forces to get rid of terrorism, and we are still in this continuing battle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He called on Americans to \u00e2\u0080\u009cput pressure on their political and military leaders to stop the Turkish attack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he said would lead to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig massacres.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said Sunday that the United States would not block a Turkish advance. But on Monday he said that he would \u00e2\u0080\u009cobliterate\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy if its military did anything \u00e2\u0080\u009coff limits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d without defining what that meant, and his aides insisted that he had not given a green light to an invasion. On Tuesday, he said that he had invited Mr. Erdogan to visit the White House next month. Two American officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic and military conversations, said that given the apparently contradictory statements by Mr. Trump, the Turks seemed flummoxed about what support, if any, they might get from the United States. As a result, they may be rethinking what to do next, the officials said. Still, several American officials said they expected a Turkish incursion to begin Wednesday, even in the face of congressional blowback. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said in a tweet directed at Turkish officials that they \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo NOT have a green light\u00e2\u0080\u009d to advance and that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is massive bipartisan opposition in Congress, which you should see as a red line.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turkish news media reported that Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s armed forces were preparing F16 jets and Howitzers. Special forces troops were arriving in buses at the border crossing of Akcakale just across from the Syrian town of Tel Abyad, and cranes were moving into position to lift concrete barriers at the border. Tel Abyad was one of two towns evacuated by American forces on Monday. The other was Ras al Ain. American officials said Tuesday that Turkey had amassed several hundred troops, including tanks and other armor, near the two towns. Political analysts with knowledge of the plan worked out with American officials said Turkey planned to set up four bases or combat posts in a narrow area along the border, and had agreed to stick to a limited action as a first stage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would expect Turkey to implement a graduated incursion, then go back to negotiation with the U.S. from a stronger position,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, Ankara director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen when it is in a better situation, do a second operation, and a third. That is a graduated strategy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument that pulling United States forces from Syria was a fulfillment of his vow to get Americans out of \u00e2\u0080\u009cendless wars\u00e2\u0080\u009d unleashed a wave of criticism, much of it from Republican lawmakers. Many argued that withdrawing the roughly 1,000 United States troops in northeastern Syrian would open a void that could be exploited by President Bashar al-Assad of Syria or his Russian and Iranian allies, or by the Islamic State. Mr. Trump has not ordered a full withdrawal from Syria. The order on Sunday was only to relocate roughly 100 to 150 troops that had been stationed near the Turkish border. About two dozen were pulled back on Monday. But analysts feared that any redeployment of Kurdish troops to fight Turkey in the north would take them away from the battle against the Islamic State. The Islamic State was driven from its last territory in Syria in February, but the S.D.F., with the support of American Special Operations Forces, continue to battle the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remnants. The American officials said the S.D.F. was already beginning to move off some of its counterterrorism missions against the Islamic State. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe danger of ISIS is real,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kobani said, adding that it maintains sleeper cells throughout the territory. His forces also oversee prisons and camps holding tens of thousands of former Islamic State fighters and their families, which Mr. Trump has said Turkey could take over. Mr. Kobani said there had been no conversations with the United States about handing over these prisoners to Turkey and he called the idea \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpossible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kobani said that he would prefer that the United States remain in Syria until the Islamic State and its remnants are destroyed and the country reached a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplete political solution that guarantees everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Pentagon on Tuesday challenged published accounts asserting that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to order American troops to pull back from the border surprised many Defense and State Department officials. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere consulted over the last several days by the president regarding the situation and efforts to protect U.S. forces in northern Syria in the face of military action by Turkey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jonathan Hoffman, a Pentagon spokesman. Several Pentagon officials confirmed that there had been discussions about Mr. Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s threats to invade northern Syria, but said that they had no hint that Mr. Trump was going to order American troops to step aside and leave their Syrian Kurdish allies vulnerable to attack. In fact, the officials said, both Mr. Esper and General Milley warned their Turkish counterparts last week that any such cross-border operation would seriously damage United States-Turkish relations. American commanders had expected to have some advance notice before Turkey launched an operation in northern Syria, and said they would probably have pulled back American forces to avoid advancing Turkish troops. But until Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order on Sunday, there were no plans to pull back pre-emptively, the officials said. In a tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Trump insisted that he was not betraying the Kurds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He warned that \u00e2\u0080\u009cany unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kobani says he would prefer to stick with the United States and work for a stable Syria, but that his forces are ready to attack if Turkey invaded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will be lots of resistance if they cross the border,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will not accept them on our land in any way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Three times over the past year, President Trump has spoken with Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and told Mr. Erdogan what he wanted to hear. Last December, Mr. Trump stunned his own national security team by abruptly deciding to pull American troops out of Syria, clearing the way for Mr. Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-sought incursion into the country. On Sunday, Mr. Trump spoke again to his Turkish counterpart, and then issued a similar declaration. And in between the calls, in June, Mr. Trump came away from a meeting with Mr. Erdogan echoing Turkish talking points blaming President Barack Obama for the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purchase of a Russian missile system. The relationship between the two prideful and blustery men has had its rocky patches \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and its threats. Mr. Trump, facing backlash from Republicans on Monday, warned on Twitter that he would \u00e2\u0080\u009ctotally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u009d if Mr. Erdogan were to cross unspecified \u00e2\u0080\u009climits\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Syria. But American and Turkish officials alike describe an unusual partnership in which Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly guided Mr. Trump toward positions that pit him against his own national security advisers and Republicans allies. Analysts call it an oddity of their relationship that two naturally combative leaders, both prone to explosive public insults, seem to understand each other and believe they can sort things out by phone. Mr. Erdogan will soon have the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear again: Mr. Trump announced in a tweet on Tuesday that the Turkish leader would visit the White House on Nov. 13. He also continued on Tuesday to defend his decision, tweeting that \u00e2\u0080\u009cin no way have we abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Erdogan is one of several foreign strongmen who draw condemnation from human rights groups but with whom Mr. Trump appears to keen to do business. Both are man-of-the-people nationalists who have battled resistance from their respective security establishments. While Mr. Trump rails against a bureaucratic \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeep State\u00e2\u0080\u009d seeking to overthrow him through investigations and impeachment, in 2016, Mr. Erdogan survived an actual military coup that turned bloody. The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeep State,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in fact, was first coined to describe the generals who long ruled Turkey from behind the scenes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey share a similar worldview, they dislike elites,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 office in the Turkish capital, Ankara. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump would probably like to govern the way Erdogan does.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Sunday, Mr. Erdogan even seemed to play a version of the Deep State card with his counterpart. According to the readout of Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s telephone call released by Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential palace, Mr. Erdogan \u00e2\u0080\u009cshared with President Trump his frustration over the U.S. military and security bureaucracy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to implement\u00e2\u0080\u009d an agreement between the two countries governing security in northern Syria. Mr. Trump responded by telling Mr. Erdogan, much as he had in December, that he would be removing American troops from the area where the Turkish leader hoped to do battle with the Kurdish-led militia that has been critical American allies against the Islamic State. Turkey considers the militia a threat to its own borders and security. Mr. Trump knows Turkey from his earlier life in real estate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he sold his brand name to the Trump Towers Istanbul in 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but like presidents before him, he has struggled to devise a consistent policy toward the country. Instead, he has focused on his personal relationship with Mr. Erdogan in conversations that people familiar with them describe as typically \u00e2\u0080\u009cfawning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump usually begins by praising Mr. Erdogan, who is himself notorious for haranguing American presidents with grievances, according to those people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a great friendship as countries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said in an appearance with Mr. Erdogan that September. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re, right now, as close as we have ever been. And a lot of that has to do with the personal relationship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The following July, he was spotted fist-bumping the Turkish leader at a NATO summit in Brussels. That chumminess has unsettled both appointed and elected officials suspicious of Mr. Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repressive policies, Islamist sympathies and deepening relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Nearly everyone agrees, however, that simply shunning the head of a NATO-member nation at the pivot point between East and West is not practical. The Trump-Erdogan friendship has already survived at least one major test, when relations flared over Mr. Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued detention of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who was jailed for nearly two years in a widespread crackdown after a failed coup in Turkey. When Mr. Brunson was not freed as he expected, Mr. Trump announced in a hostile tweet that he was doubling tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum and watching the Turkish lira slide. After Mr. Brunson was freed last October, Mr. Trump expressed public gratitude to Mr. Erdogan for \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaking this possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To some former United States officials who have worked closely with Mr. Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government, the relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan is an unsolved puzzle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really clear to me what Trump, or the United States, gets out of this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Phil Gordon, who served at the State Department and on the National Security Council under Mr. Obama. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consistent with other seemingly inexplicable Trump actions that are more in line with Russian interests than with ours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Mr. Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Even before their collective anger over Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sunday announcement about Syria, Senate Republicans had been frustrated with the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resistance to placing sanctions on Turkey for its purchase of the advanced Russian S-400 missile system. Congressional leaders call it a clear violation of a 2017 law requiring economic penalties on countries that purchase Russian arms. With pressure mounting in Washington on Mr. Trump to enact sanctions, he sat down in June with Mr. Erdogan at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, where the Turkish leader argued that he had been forced to buy Russian arms because Mr. Obama had unreasonably blocked Turkish efforts to purchase the American-made Patriot missile. Former Obama administration officials say the story is far more complicated, and that Mr. Erdogan had other options. But they said the Turkish leader had skilfully handed Mr. Trump, who revels in criticism of his predecessor, an ideal talking point as he deferred questions about whether he would impose sanctions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very tough situation that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very tough situation that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been placed in \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the United States,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said in mid-July, adding that \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really fair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump did cancel the planned sale of more than 100 F-35 fighter jets to Turkey, whose operation in proximity to the Russian system NATO opposes on security grounds. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that the law \u00e2\u0080\u009crequires\u00e2\u0080\u009d sanctions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump is trying really hard to avoid slapping sanctions on Turkey, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partly because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to not rupture his relationship with Erdogan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. A Pentagon spokesman on Tuesday challenged published reports that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to order American troops to move out of the area where Turkey plans an offensive surprised senior officials and said Mr. Trump had consulted Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in the days before talking to Mr. Erdogan. But Pentagon officials said they had discussed Mr. Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s threats to invade northern Syria, and there was no prior hint about Mr. Trump ordering American troops to step aside and leave their Syrian Kurdish allies vulnerable to attack. In fact, the officials said, both Mr. Esper and General Milley warned their Turkish counterparts last week that any such cross-border operation would seriously damage United States-Turkey relations. One senior Trump administration official on Monday said that it was troubling to some officials that Mr. Erdogan was not concerned about angering Mr. Trump, and that he appeared to feel he had autonomy to move into Syria. In all the furor over Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement, there has been a studied silence from Mr. Erdogan. Likewise, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent tweets \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even those threatening Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy with destruction \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have avoided calling out Mr. Erdogan by name.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 A White House official who listened to President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July phone call with Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leader described it as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrazy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrightening\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompletely lacking in substance related to national security,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to a memo written by the whistle-blower at the center of the Ukraine scandal, a C.I.A. officer who spoke to the White House official. The official was \u00e2\u0080\u009cvisibly shaken by what had transpired,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the C.I.A. officer wrote in his memo, one day after Mr. Trump pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in a July 25 phone call to open investigations that would benefit him politically. A palpable sense of concern had already taken hold among at least some in the White House that the call had veered well outside the bounds of traditional diplomacy, the officer wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe official stated that there was already a conversation underway with White House lawyers about how to handle the discussion because, in the official\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view, the president had clearly committed a criminal act by urging a foreign power to investigate a U.S. person for the purposes of advancing his own re-election bid in 2020,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the C.I.A. officer wrote. The document provides a rare glimpse into at least one of the communications with a White House official that helped prompt the whistle-blower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s formal complaint to the intelligence community inspector general detailing a broad pressure campaign on Ukraine by Mr. Trump, administration officials and his personal lawyer. The complaint and a reconstructed transcript released by the White House formed the basis of the House impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. The inspector general, Michael Atkinson, handed the two-page memo over to Congress last week along with other documents that shed light on the whistle-blower and his actions. A person familiar with their contents, which Fox News first reported, described them to The New York Times. A lawyer for the whistle-blower did not comment. The whistle-blower, who relied on \u00e2\u0080\u009cmultiple U.S. government officials\u00e2\u0080\u009d for his complaint, said that Mr. Trump was \u00e2\u0080\u009cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was not clear whether the White House official he spoke to on July 26 was the second whistle-blower, who has also provided information to Mr. Atkinson, or a different person. Neither whistle-blower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name is public. Little, if any, of the whistle-blower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint has been disproved, though Mr. Trump has sought to discredit him. The White House transcript largely affirmed his account of the call, and Mr. Atkinson deemed his complaint credible, saying he interviewed others who corroborated it. The White House official \u00e2\u0080\u009cseemed keen to inform a trusted colleague within the national security apparatus about the call,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the C.I.A. officer wrote in his July 26 memo. Much of the whistle-blower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memo also comports with the existing public record of the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. The C.I.A. officer noted that he spoke to the White House official for only a few minutes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand as a result, I only received highlights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The memo detailed key aspects of the conversation, including Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, and a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election.  Mr. Atkinson shared the memo and the other documents with the House Intelligence Committee last week before a session in which he privately described the steps he took to assess the credibility of the complaint. In submitting his complaint, the whistle-blower identified three facts that could be used to accuse him of potential bias against Mr. Trump, the documents showed. Two were redacted. The third indicated that the whistle-blower is a registered Democrat, a fact first reported by CNN last week that has widely circulated since. Responding to that reporting on Twitter, Mark S. Zaid, a lawyer for the whistle-blower, brushed off the idea that party registration proved anything about his client\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credibility. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t comment on identifying info but if true, give me a break! Bias? Seriously?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. Still, the whistle-blower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political affiliation and the other facts, should they become public, could fuel arguments from Mr. Trump and his Republican allies that his actions were politically motivated or that his political views colored how he assessed a string of actions he heard about from other government officials and then summarized in his complaint. Mr. Atkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial review of the complaint identified some indications \u00e2\u0080\u009cof an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote in a letter to the acting director of national intelligence in August. But, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009csuch evidence did not change my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern \u00e2\u0080\u0098appears credible.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d As part of his complaint, the whistle-blower filled out a form, also reviewed by The Times, that asked what other actions, if any, he took in regard to his allegations. The whistle-blower checked a box indicating that he had relayed his concerns about Mr. Trump to another \u00e2\u0080\u009coffice of department/agency involved,\u00e2\u0080\u009d likely a reference to the C.I.A.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general counsel, Courtney Simmons Elwood. The whistle-blower had an intermediary share his allegations with Ms. Elwood before he approached Mr. Atkinson. The whistle-blower did not check a box indicating that he had spoken to Congress or one of its committees about his allegations. Republicans have seized on that since Fox News revealed it last week, arguing that it is at odds with the C.I.A. officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to a House Intelligence Committee aide about his concerns before he filed his whistle-blower complaint. It is illegal to intentionally lie on a disclosure form, but whether the whistle-blower was justified in omitting his initial contact with Congress probably depends on the substance of the interactions. The officer approached an aide to Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the Intelligence Committee chairman, with vague outlines of his concern, a spokesman for Mr. Schiff has said. The House aide, in accordance with committee practice, encouraged the officer to hire a lawyer to advise him and contact the inspector general. But he also shared some of what the officer conveyed with Mr. Schiff, though not his identity. The whistle-blower did not indicate on the complaint form that he had spoken to Congress because he did not disclose the substance of his allegations to the Intelligence Committee, a person familiar with the matter said.",

      "author": "Charlie Savage",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 A federal judge secretly ruled last year that the F.B.I.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s procedures for searching for Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 emails within a repository of intercepted messages that were gathered without a warrant violated Fourth Amendment privacy rights, newly declassified files showed. The files show that the F.B.I. resisted a new congressional mandate that required it to keep closer track of when it searched for Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 information gathered by the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warrantless surveillance program. The F.B.I.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defiance set off a secret court fight that ultimately prompted the bureau to relent, the files showed. Moreover, they show, the F.B.I. improperly searched the repository for information involving large numbers of Americans who fit within general categories but against whom there was no individualized basis for suspicion. In a twist, one March 2017 search used more than 70,000 identifiers, like email addresses, linked to the F.B.I.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own work force. The revelations were contained in a set of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act rulings that the Trump administration declassified on Tuesday. The rulings revealed a fight that has unfolded behind closed doors over the past year, adding a new chapter to the story of the warrantless surveillance program tracing back to the Sept. 11 attacks. The latest chapter began in early 2018, when Congress extended the law that authorizes the warrantless surveillance program \u00e2\u0080\u0094 known as Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while adding a new requirement: Agencies that use the surveillance program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repository of intercepted messages must win court approval for rules about how they may search it for Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 data. In October 2018, the FISA court judge, James E. Boasberg, approved the procedures submitted by other agencies, like the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency. But he rejected the F.B.I.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, saying the bureau\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules were \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which protects Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 privacy from unreasonable searches. Rather than comply with his ruling and adjust the F.B.I. rules, the Justice Department made a rare appeal to a three-judge panel that can review FISA court decisions. In July, the review court affirmed a central part of Judge Boasberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original ruling. After that, the F.B.I. acquiesced and changed its procedures, resolving the fight, the files showed. The Section 702 program permits the government to collect communications from American companies like Google or AT&T without a warrant, so long as the target of the surveillance is a noncitizen abroad. The government can collect the data even when that person is talking to an American. A particular controversy has arisen over the F.B.I.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to use it to find information about Americans. Complicating that debate, the F.B.I. for years has not kept records of how often its agents searched the repository for information about Americans. So when the program was up for renewal last year, Congress required the bureau to track such queries. But the procedures that the F.B.I. initially proposed simply called for it to keep track of all queries of the repository, without distinguishing which sought information about Americans and which were focused on foreigners. Judge Boasberg rejected that idea as inadequate, and the appeals court upheld his ruling. The judge also wanted F.B.I. agents, before reviewing any emails of Americans that turned up in a search, to document in writing how that search term \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like an email address or a phone number \u00e2\u0080\u0094 met the standard of being likely to return foreign intelligence information or criminal evidence. The F.B.I. initially resisted that idea, too, but after the appeals court said it had to rewrite its procedures to track queries better, it accepted the other new mandate, too. The idea of requiring agents to document their rationales for searching for an American\u00e2\u0080\u0099s information emerged from several recent episodes in which the Justice Department reported to the court that the F.B.I. had conducted improperly sweeping searches of the repository. Those events formed the backdrop to the fight over the new rules for querying the surveillance repository. Specifically, F.B.I. agents had carried out several large-scale searches for Americans who generically fit into broad categories \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like they were F.B.I. employees or contractors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so long as agents had a reason to believe that someone within that category might have relevant information. But there has to be an individualized reason to search for any particular American\u00e2\u0080\u0099s information. The documents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 description of episodes involving large-batch queries that violated the rules were heavily redacted, so it was difficult to discern what the agents had been trying to learn. The discussion of the F.B.I.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s search for tens of thousands of identifiers involving its own work force also said that the bureau\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general counsel had raised objections beforehand. (The results were never scrutinized, the ruling said.) Judge Boasberg wrote that the searches involving large numbers of queries using Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 identifiers raised a \u00e2\u0080\u009cserious concern\u00e2\u0080\u009d that agents either did not understand the standard or were indifferent to it. The ruling also mentioned two searches in December 2017 that were flagged as problematic \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one involving a query for messages containing any of 6,800 Social Security numbers, and the other involving 1,600 queries whose details were censored. Several other episodes in February 2018 apparently involved F.B.I. efforts to identify Americans whom it could try to develop into potential confidential sources of information, the rulings showed. Several of the large-batch searches involved agents proactively trying to identify threats within the information the government had collected without waiting for a tip or criminal referral, said a senior F.B.I. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the documents with reporters. But the details were classified, the official added. The F.B.I. did not want to have to document a rationale every time it used an American\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identifying information to search the warrantless surveillance database because its systems allow agents to search all its databases at once \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not just one at a time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and most of the time, the warrantless surveillance database, centered on foreigners abroad, yields no results anyway. But Amy Jeffress, a former senior Justice Department official in the Obama administration whom Judge Boasberg had appointed as a friend of the court to critique the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position, proposed the idea of having agents document their rationales only if something came back, before the agents could look at it. The presence of Ms. Jeffress and Judge Boasberg in the FISA court review process followed the uproar over surveillance after the 2013 leaks of National Security Agency files by the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden. Among other things, the resulting debate put a spotlight on the enigmatic FISA court, which, after hearing only from the government in secret court proceedings, had blessed an idiosyncratic interpretation of the law to approve a separate N.S.A. bulk phone records program that Mr. Snowden exposed. A federal appeals court later rejected that interpretation. Those events brought to light that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. had used his authority to decide who sits on the 11-member FISA court to assemble a panel that consisted of 11 federal judges either appointed by Republican presidents or selected by Republican senators in deals with a Democratic president. In early 2014, when one of the seats became vacant and Chief Justice Roberts had an opportunity to fill it, he broke that partisan pattern by designating Judge Boasberg, whom President Barack Obama had appointed. And in 2015, when Congress enacted the USA Freedom Act, which ended and replaced the bulk phone records program, lawmakers also enacted a provision that encouraged the FISA court to appoint friends of the court with security clearances to critique the Justice Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arguments in novel and significant cases. That set up Ms. Jeffress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in arguing that the F.B.I. should be required to obey more limits than it wanted.",

MSNBC and The Washington Post will host it. Eight candidates have qualified for the debate so far: Mr. Yang was the latest to qualify, because he received enough support in a Quinnipiac University national poll released Tuesday afternoon. Other candidates have until 11:59 p.m. on Nov. 13 to qualify. While 12 candidates qualified for the fourth debate, scheduled for next week near Columbus, Ohio, the D.N.C. has set higher criteria for the following one. Candidates will need at least 165,000 donors (up from 130,000) and at least 3 percent support in four approved polls (up from 2 percent). As an alternative to the 3-percent-in-four-polls requirement, candidates can qualify by registering at least 5 percent support in two polls conducted in any of the four states that hold the first nominating contests next year: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The gradually increasing requirements have steadily culled the field of debaters and, to a lesser extent, the Democratic field as a whole. Twenty candidates qualified for each of the first two debates, when they needed only 65,000 donors or 1 percent in three polls. But only 10 met the higher requirements for the third debate; two more met them in time for the October debate. The fourth debate next week will be hosted by CNN and The New York Times. Mr. Sanders, who is recovering from a heart attack, is still expected to participate in next week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate. On Tuesday morning, before seeing a new cardiologist, he told reporters that he had felt unusually fatigued for the past month or two, and that he \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould have listened to those symptoms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": "Since then, his campaign has insisted that Mr. Sanders does not intend to drop out of the race. During a telephone call with staff members on Monday, Mr. Sanders said he felt \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began this campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jane Sanders, who remains one of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closest advisers, said that idea was \u00e2\u0080\u009csomething that the entire campaign, and especially me, have been saying for months \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not for his health but for the ability to keep up that kind of a pace for everybody else, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Campaign officials also downplayed Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs Bernie said, we are going to have an active campaign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, said in a statement on Tuesday evening. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead of a breakneck series of events that lap the field, we are going to keep a marathoner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pace that still manages to outrun everyone else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic, said Mr. Sanders had been thinking about changing the pace of his campaign schedule for some time, and aides discussed this with him when he was in the hospital. Known for keeping a grueling schedule on the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders, who finished second to Mrs. Clinton in the 2016 primary, will often crisscross a state with multiple stops for big rallies and smaller town hall-style events and gatherings. There is no recent precedent for a candidate to suffer such a serious health setback in the midst of a campaign, at least not since President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in the fall of 1955, a year before his re-election. Mrs. Clinton stayed off the campaign trail for three days in the fall of 2016 after she felt dizzy at a 9/11 commemoration but was only diagnosed with pneumonia. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley was briefly sidelined as he sought the Democratic nomination because he had an irregular heartbeat. Mr. Bradley, a former professional basketball player who was only 56 at the time, returned to the campaign trail but was dogged by questions about his health and was beaten decisively by Al Gore. BURLINGTON, Vt. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Senator Bernie Sanders, in a striking concession for a leading presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that he planned to slow down his pace on the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack a week ago, and acknowledged that voters would likely consider his health when deciding whether to support him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders told reporters after a visit with a local cardiologist. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks stood in sharp contrast with comments in recent days from his campaign advisers, who have insisted that the Vermont senator was neither changing course nor easing his trademark intensity as a result of the heart attack. Given Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s influential role in the Democratic race, not only as a top candidate but also as a driving force in policy debates, his decision to pull back campaigning injects new uncertainty into the contest \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both for the future of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s candidacy and the possible ramifications for other contenders. In recent weeks, the race has become more of a two-person contest between Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fellow liberal who shares many of the same goals as Mr. Sanders, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose policy positions are generally more moderate. Ms. Warren has risen steadily in many polls while both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have lost some ground, particularly in surveys of Iowa voters, who will hold the first nominating contest in February. Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far. \u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will just raise the issue of his age\u00e2\u0080\u008b, which to me has always been the Achilles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 heel of the Sanders campaign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden is 76, while Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73. Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington Tuesday, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was planning to drop out of the race and said he would continue to campaign actively. Indeed, Mr. Sanders remains formidable: He reported a third-quarter fund-raising total of $25.3 million, the largest in the Democratic field, and he has helped steer many in the party to embrace ideas like \u00e2\u0080\u009cMedicare for all\u00e2\u0080\u009d and tuition-free public colleges. Mr. Sanders has been campaigning almost nonstop when not carrying out his Senate duties in Washington, D.C., a pace that he pointedly noted on Tuesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked to clarify what he meant when he said the campaign would change, he replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cProbably not doing four rallies a day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Standing next to his wife, Jane, Mr. Sanders also acknowledged that his heart attack could be a factor for voters considering whether to support him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything that happens every day weighs on how people feel about you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd my own view is that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the voters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 view \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you look at the totality of who a candidate is. You look at what that candidate stands for, the integrity of that candidate, the history of that candidate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It has been a difficult week for the Sanders family: In addition to Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart attack, his daughter-in-law Rain\u00c3\u00a8 Riggs died at age 46, shortly after she was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer, according to a death notice. Ms. Riggs was the wife of Levi Sanders, Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son. Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign aides were heartened that the first polls since his hospitalization did not show a significant drop in his support. But the candidate and his wife have not been revealing much to the public, or even some of his own staff, about when he would get back to the campaign trail and how aggressive he would be once he does return. It is now almost certain that he will have a far more difficult path to the nomination. Democrats are overwhelmingly focused on finding a candidate they believe can defeat Mr. Trump, having made clear in surveys that ousting a president they loathe is their top priority. Now, in addition to questions about whether he is too far to the left to win over general election voters, Mr. Sanders will have to face doubts about his physical capabilities. Further, unlike in 2016, progressive voters have an alternative to Mr. Sanders in this race. While some of his bedrock supporters will not abandon him, other left-wing voters will gladly cast a vote for Ms. Warren. That was not the case when Mr. Sanders faced Mrs. Clinton in the last primary. Mr. Sanders returned to Burlington over the weekend, after spending three days in a hospital in Las Vegas. His campaign said he felt chest pains during an event last Tuesday, and he was taken to the hospital, where two stents were inserted into an artery.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Senator Lindsey Graham, an unsparing critic of President Trump before he entered the White House, rarely if ever questions him anymore, even after the president urged foreign governments to investigate his political rivals. But on Monday, Mr. Graham found something to criticize, and he could not have been tougher on Mr. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI expect the American president to do what is in our national security interest, and it is never in our national security interest to abandon an ally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Graham, Republican of South Carolina, railed on Fox News over Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to pull back in Syria. He and other Republicans joined Democrats in saying that the move could potentially clear the way for a Turkish offensive against Kurdish fighters who have helped the United States root out the Islamic State. Mr. Graham also delivered what could be considered the ultimate insult to Mr. Trump: comparing his Syria policy to that of his predecessor, Barack Obama. Consistently assailed for refusing to stand up to the president, Senate Republicans this week briefly found their voices, bombarding Mr. Trump with public complaints over his Syria decision. The fleeting moment of dissonance revealed what has emerged as an informal rule of thumb among Republican senators who consider themselves foreign policy experts, with wide latitude to weigh in and potentially influence a president who has far less experience on the subject than they do. They are willing to break with Mr. Trump on matters of international affairs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but only when they believe there are no domestic political consequences for doing so. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect the same reaction when it comes to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Ukraine, the subject of an accelerating impeachment fight. Republicans see that issue as an existential threat to the president and their party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rule in Washington, and are reluctant to legitimize what they regard as an overreach by Democrats by joining in their criticism. In fact, just a day after his harsh assessment of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision on Syria, Mr. Graham rushed to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense in the Ukraine matter by announcing a hearing that could serve as a counterweight to the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry. He said on Tuesday that the Judiciary Committee, which he is the chairman of, would hear from Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer, about \u00e2\u0080\u009ccorruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which Mr. Trump has argued justified his pressure campaign to get the Ukrainian president to investigate Democrats. When it comes to foreign policy, many senators have spent considerable time developing their expertise, making repeated trips to the Middle East and other hot spots and becoming deeply invested in their positions. They feel confident expressing their opinion, even when it is quite contrary to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany of us have been dealing with this for a decade or two decades, and I think there are a lot of visits to the area and a lot of discussions that stand behind our views on these issues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, who had previously counseled the White House on the necessity of maintaining forces in Syria. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an area where it has been a consistent concern that leaving those places would create bigger problems than staying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The opinions of Mr. Blunt and his colleagues also align with those of much of the Republican foreign policy establishment, current and former top members of the military, and many conservative media commentators, bolstering their willingness to speak out. There truly is strength in numbers. Just a few Republicans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 notably Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, both avowed members of the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s noninterventionist wing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hailed the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision. \u00e2\u0080\u009cForeign policy has always been Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Achilles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 heel with Senate Republicans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and former staff adviser to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican who faulted the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Syria decision \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but not his comments about China and Ukraine. Mr. Conant said Republicans were also driven by their view that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foreign policy missteps were more damaging, requiring a more forceful response than his day-to-day incendiary statements. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone forgets Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tweets after a couple of days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Conant said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut history will never forget if the U.S. allows our Kurdish allies to be massacred.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the same time, foreign policy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unlike, say, impeachment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is lower on the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s priority list. Differences of opinion are less likely to spur him to lash out as he has in recent days, for example, at Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, after Mr. Romney said that the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requests of Ukraine and China to investigate Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were \u00e2\u0080\u009cwrong and appalling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump responded with name-calling, disparagement and a gleeful reminder of Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defeat of Mr. Romney in 2012. Foreign policy appears to be one of the few areas where Mr. Trump is willing to brook some difference of opinion. Pressed on Monday about the tough criticism of his Syria policy from the likes of Mr. Graham; Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and Nikki R. Haley, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former United Nations ambassador, the president was uncharacteristically restrained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have great respect for all of the people that you named,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd they have their opinion, and a lot of people do. And I could also name many more than you just named of people that totally are supportive. You see the names coming out; people are extremely thrilled because they say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to bring our people back home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If Mr. Trump is less likely to be angered by criticism of his foreign policy, many Republicans believe their constituents will be as well. The issue usually does not stir the kind of base revolt and primary challenges back home that have become major concerns for Republicans who dare to cross Mr. Trump on other matters. While many of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core supporters are no doubt eager to see him follow through on his campaign vow to end America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overseas entanglements, plenty of other Republicans are worried about a premature withdrawal from a trouble spot and a potential resurgence of the Islamic State. Taking on the president over his dealings with Ukraine, however, is another matter entirely. Even those such as Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who have joined Mr. Romney in taking issue with Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interactions with Ukrainian officials say that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe any offense claimed by Democrats rises to the level of impeachment. The re-election campaign of Mr. McConnell, who felt compelled on Monday to encourage the president to exercise presidential leadership and reconsider his Syria plan, is currently behind online advertisements in which Mr. McConnell vows to use his position as majority leader to thwart impeachment even before any articles calling for the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ouster reach the Senate. The break with Mr. Trump over Syria has another ancillary benefit for Republicans who are often accused of falling in line behind Mr. Trump like automatons even when he is at his most outrageous: It allows them to point to a significant policy development on which they have quickly and clearly spoken out against him. It cannot be said that they never differ with Mr. Trump, but those differences remain few and far between even as Democrats ramp up their effort to oust the president.",

Mr. Nixon was not a crook, he insisted, though that 18-and-a-half-minute gap in the Watergate tapes did make the town wonder. But from the Senate floor in April 1974, Joseph R. Biden Jr., a 31-year-old freshman Democrat, addressed his congressional elders with a plea: Let the Republican president have his say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the case of an impeachment trial, the emotions of the American people would be strummed, as a guitar, with every newscast and each edition of the daily paper,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden warned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe incessant demand for news or rumors of news \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whatever its basis of legitimacy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would be overwhelming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He urged against \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice-in-Wonderland\u00e2\u0080\u009d justice: \u00e2\u0080\u009csentence first, verdict afterwards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said that if he had to render a judgment on that day, his choice would be \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot Guilty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden was no fan of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, he said \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and might well find him culpable once all facts were aired. But this was a time for \u00e2\u0080\u009crestraint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a feeling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat my children and my grandchildren will be looking back on what I said or did not say in April of 1974.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Forty-five years later, Mr. Biden finds himself consumed by an impeachment drama of a different sort. He is at the center of the emerging Democratic case against President Trump, who in a July phone call pressed the president of Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and his son. It is a testament to the long and winding arc of Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public life that he has been a player in every major impeachment debate of the last half-century. Yet while other 2020 candidates have long argued that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct demands an extraordinary constitutional response, Mr. Biden has approached the subject with striking wariness, quick to defend his name but disinclined to position himself as an impeachment crusader, despite the perils the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unsubstantiated attacks may pose to Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own campaign. On Wednesday, after weeks of caution \u00e2\u0080\u0094 leaving the task to Congress, taking care to stay in his lane \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mr. Biden called unambiguously for Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment for the first time, saying the president had \u00e2\u0080\u009cbetrayed this nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was a moment that Mr. Biden reached reluctantly. Though he had said before that Mr. Trump had probably violated his \u00e2\u0080\u009cconstitutional responsibility,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the former vice president has also called Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prospective impeachment \u00e2\u0080\u009ca tragedy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A review of Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history with the topic, as a senator during the Nixon and Clinton administrations, helps explain why. Decades before he moved from ensemble figure to leading character in the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment theater, friends and peers from his Senate days say those episodes made plain to Mr. Biden just how damaging and unseemly the proceedings could be for all involved. In both public remarks and private conversations with colleagues, Mr. Biden conveyed his discomfort with overturning the will of the voters, regardless of the executive transgression. He suggested that public opinion should be taken into consideration, even for senators who preferred to vote their conscience, since it was the choice of the electorate that lawmakers presumed to override. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis. Is. Their. President,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thundered at an event in November 1998 as President Bill Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortunes rested with Congress, summarizing the view of Democratic voters whom Mr. Biden said he had met. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t screw with him unless you have an overwhelming case that you can make that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being fair about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And in an early signal of Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deference to formal protocol, his experiences in the 1970s and 1990s seemed to crystallize the abiding faith in institutions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 deep respect for the Senate, a reverence for process \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that remains his hallmark, even as his current competitors suggest he is out of step with the crackling tribalism of the Trump era. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe stuck with kind of an institutional approach to things, which he did for his whole career,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ted Kaufman, a longtime friend and aide who worked for Mr. Biden during Watergate and later succeeded him briefly as senator. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet the system work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For a young lawmaker straining to find his way amid personal tragedy, the Nixon fracas was an early test of Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defer-to-convention instincts and a jarring introduction to the capital. After his election in 1972, Mr. Biden had spoken to Mr. Nixon in an uncomfortable, minute-long courtesy phone call from the president after Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash that December. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand you were on the Hill at the time, and your wife was just driving by herself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Nixon said, stammering for a few beats, according to a recording. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe main part is, you can remember that she was there when you won a great victory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d) In his floor speech on impeachment, labeled in the Congressional Record under \u00e2\u0080\u009cFairness to the President,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden described himself as a harsh critic of Mr. Nixon, but he added that the president was due the \u00e2\u0080\u009cutmost presumption of innocence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a day when equality is on everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips, I suggest that in practice, in extraordinary times involving our highest office of government, some people may be, in fact, more equal than others,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd in this case, I refer to the president. His official derelictions, if proved, and his subsequent ouster, should it occur, will have an impact on our institutions and upon ourselves as Americans, beyond that which it would have for any of us who are involved in such a proceeding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Moving through the Capitol, Mr. Biden seemed awed at the historical burden that greeted him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were walking down the hall and he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098What a time for me to come into the Senate,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d recalled Rufus Edmisten, then the deputy chief counsel to the Senate Watergate committee. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098I would come at a time like this.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d In his 2007 memoir, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPromises to Keep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden described a formative memory of a crucial meeting after Mr. Nixon asked Senator John Stennis, a conservative Democrat from Mississippi, to run interference for the White House by listening to the Watergate tapes and summarizing them for his colleagues, rather than insisting on their wide release. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember what he said in the Democratic caucus that day: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve thought long and hard on what my obligation is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden wrote, quoting Mr. Stennis, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve decided I am a Senate man. I am not the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man. Therefore, I will not listen to the tapes. I am a man of the Senate.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud to say I am a Senate man, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kaufman said that it was not until August, days before Mr. Nixon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resignation, that Mr. Biden became convinced that the president must go. The senator was walking to catch a train when word arrived that Charles Wiggins, a Republican congressman who had led the Nixon defense, had changed his mind amid revelations that Mr. Nixon had worked to conceal the Watergate break-in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe just said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098O.K., this is it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kaufman recalled of Mr. Biden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd he dictated, literally, to the staff person on what was a big deal: \u00e2\u0080\u0098It was time for Nixon to resign.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden and his fellow senators seemed relieved that the president had saved them the spectacle of a trial. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody was looking forward to the trial,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said J. Bennett Johnston, a former Democratic senator from Louisiana, remembering a petition in his home state to support Mr. Nixon, with some 40,000 names attached. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was not as much support in the South for Nixon as there is for Trump now, but he was basically pretty popular. So nobody was looking forward to having to vote on that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A quarter-century later, when the Senate impeachment trial of Mr. Clinton began, Mr. Biden was not afforded the luxury of a presidential resignation. But with the leader of his own party under scrutiny, Mr. Biden often invoked his appeals for caution in the Nixon age as evidence that he was being intellectually consistent. He said it was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cserious mistake\u00e2\u0080\u009d to overlook public sentiment on impeachment, noting that Democrats had won gains in the 1998 midterm elections. He claimed that the Republican-led House, under Speaker Newt Gingrich, had \u00e2\u0080\u009cproceeded without sufficient dignity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Barbara Boxer, a former California Democratic senator who joined Mr. Biden in clearing Mr. Clinton in the Senate trial, described impeachment as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca miserable experience\u00e2\u0080\u009d but one that played to Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strengths as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cstatesman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just going to run out there in flames,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. But at times, impeachment has also coaxed less subtle flourishes from Mr. Biden. In an appearance at the National Press Club in November 1998, after distinguishing between immoral and impeachable behavior, he set off on a hypothetical about Mr. Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, implying that had Ms. Lewinsky been Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, he would have clocked the sitting president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWere it my daughter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 notwithstanding this particular young woman is not the epitome of what I would want a young woman to be \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I would be looking for the man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose who know me know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not joking. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be looking for him to give him a straight right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Notwithstanding this particular senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fatherly dream sequence, he also reminded the crowd of his credibility on the broader question of Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s professional fate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI made that plea in 1974, and I make the plea again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe plea for restraint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 When Michaelyn Mankel approached Joseph R. Biden Jr. at an Iowa steak fry last month to demand dramatic action on climate change, the former vice president clasped the 24-year-old\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands and assured her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a better deal from me than anybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He did, after all, introduce the very first climate change legislation in Congress, in 1986, before Ms. Mankel was born. He also helped to orchestrate the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreen jobs\u00e2\u0080\u009d strategy under the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic stimulus package. He supported landmark regulations on coal plants and automobile tailpipe emissions as vice president, and helped to secure the Paris Agreement, the 2015 pact to limit the rise of global temperatures. His climate change plan would spend $1.7 trillion over a decade, impose a tax on greenhouse gases and aim to bring carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Yet Ms. Mankel, a full-time volunteer for the youth-led Sunrise Movement, was disappointed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis far along in his campaign, it seems he is still ill-prepared to answer a serious question about the climate crisis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in an interview. And so it has gone for Mr. Biden, whose experience in the wars over climate change is unmatched among Democratic contenders for the White House, but whose image remains soporific to the young activists driving the debate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTimes have changed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nigel Purvis, a State Department climate negotiator under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, who called Mr. Biden \u00e2\u0080\u009ca consistent and reliable climate champion\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the Senate and for the White House. But, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike most longtime Democratic politicians, Biden has a twenty-year track record of advocating for incremental measures, and today the Democratic primary base wants dramatic action.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A new poll made public Tuesday indicated that Mr. Biden remained the front-runner among Democrats and those who count themselves as \u00e2\u0080\u009cclimate voters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But other candidates, like Elizabeth Warren, are fast closing in. Meantime, the former vice president keeps being accosted on live television and at campaign events by young activists challenging his commitment and his perceived coziness with fossil fuel interests. It is true that Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climate plan is neither the priciest nor the most ambitious \u00e2\u0080\u0094 others call for reaching carbon neutrality well before midcentury. His refusal to endorse calls for a ban on hydraulic fracturing, a natural-gas extraction method commonly called fracking, may be politically pragmatic as he courts voters in Pennsylvania and Ohio, but it is not popular with activists. Beyond the policy specifics is the sense that Mr. Biden, 76, is simply not the man of the moment. To young climate activists, his campaign has, so far, failed to capture the urgency outlined by a high-profile United Nations report that warned the Earth was on track to experience fatal heat waves and food shortages by 2040, sooner than earlier projections. On a personal level, the candidate can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite connect with an incensed climate movement personified by Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish activist who angrily chastised world leaders gathered at the United Nations last month, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters seem incredulous that his record and proposals have not won young voters over. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a guy who was introducing bills on climate change before this was on the radar screen of most politicians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jake Sullivan, who served as Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national security adviser in the White House. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somebody who talks about the issue in an incredibly passionate and purposeful way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign challenged the belief among many younger activists that the former vice president is not likely to make climate change a top priority if elected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are some folks in the climate movement who are very vocal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stef Feldman, Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy director. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are also folks who are believers in the drastic efforts that we need to do to combat climate change who think Joe Biden is the best one equipped to address the challenge, because he has the experience of bringing other countries to the table.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But other issues keep drowning out that message. Questions about Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to energize voters on climate change come as national political attention is focused on accusations that President Trump put pressure on the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who once sat on the board of a Ukrainian company, Burisma.  (Despite Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accusations of corruption on the part of the Bidens, no evidence has surfaced that the former vice president knowingly took any steps to help his son or the company.) Trump supporters might focus on Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s monthly salary, as much as $50,000. Climate activists are more concerned about Burisma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business: natural gas. Fossil fuels and Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support for them are at the heart of the climate movement\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerns. Three other Democratic contenders \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have called for a national ban on fracking. Mr. Biden has not. (Experts have noted that an outright ban on fracking across the United States would require an act of Congress and could not be done by executive action. However, there are regulatory steps a president could take to limit the practice.) Heather Zichal, an informal adviser to Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign who helped write domestic climate change policies in the Obama administration, served until recently on the board of Cheniere Energy, a liquefied natural gas export company. In September, Mr. Biden attended a fund-raiser hosted by Andrew Goldman, co-founder of another natural gas company, Western LNG. Isaac Larkin, a 27-year-old biologist, asked Mr. Biden about that fund-raiser during a forum on climate change on CNN last month and accused the candidate of violating a pledge not to accept money from fossil fuel executives. Mr. Biden responded that Mr. Goldman did not meet that definition because he was no longer involved with the day-to-day operations of the company and did not sit on the board. Mr. Larkin, in an interview, criticized \u00e2\u0080\u009cBiden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to clip hairs about who is or isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t technically a fossil fuel executive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also took issue with the position of the Obama administration that natural gas is an important \u00e2\u0080\u009cbridge fuel\u00e2\u0080\u009d to transition from coal to renewable sources like wind and solar. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bridge is on fire and we need to get off the bridge and get to a new place immediately,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Larkin said. Ms. Feldman noted that the former vice president has called for banning oil and gas drilling on public lands. She also said that even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists convened by the United Nations to guide world leaders in policymaking, has acknowledged a role for natural gas as a way to reduce emissions from coal plants. Of course, no Democratic plan has a chance without the White House, and no Democrat will win the presidency without swing states where the fossil fuel industry employs thousands, such as Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump won by less than 1 percentage point. Mr. Biden was born in Scranton, Pa. Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, said it was possible for a candidate who opposes fracking to win Pennsylvania, but he said that was not Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis approach is staying close to the middle, giving enough strength on environmental issues to show he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a vast improvement over the president and hope that does the trick,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Borick said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consummate Biden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That style rubs young voters like Ms. Mankel the wrong way. She acknowledged that she was unfamiliar with most of the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signature regulations to rein in greenhouse gases. She said she was sure they were ambitious compared to what came before. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut frankly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "Vincent Connare, the creator of Comic Sans, has something to say about his Frankenstein-like font: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you love Comic Sans you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know much about typography. And if you hate Comic Sans you need a new hobby.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of all the things people love to hate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mondays, the Kardashians, candy corn, Nickelback \u00e2\u0080\u0094 few evoke the scorn and indignation of what Mr. Connare affectionately calls \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Justin Bieber of fonts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The depth of the internet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distaste for Comic Sans was on full display this week, when an attorney representing two of Rudy Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s associates informed Congress that his clients wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t comply with the impeachment inquiry demands, with a letter printed in that widely derided type. The font quickly trended on Twitter. At least one user recommended the lawyer be disbarred. But Mr. Connare said he believed that the attorney knew what he was doing by using a divisive font. Where legal documents are often written in Courier, Comic Sans scoffs at what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s politically correct. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Not only am I going to refuse to submit these documents, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to use a typeface that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t submit to the solemnity of the law, and Congress and public institutions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael Bierut, a partner at the design firm Pentagram. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOr maybe he just likes Comic Sans. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to say. Few typefaces are this freighted with public opinion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But strongly held beliefs can be unifying. Holly Combs, 43, fell in love with her husband, David Combs, 20 years ago over their shared contempt for Comic Sans. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe told me it was his goal to learn every typeface, and I was like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so sexy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Combs said. When a local art gallery gave her a work assignment in Comic Sans, the pair bonded over their mutual distaste for what they deemed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cleast thoughtful\u00e2\u0080\u009d font. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098What if we ban Comic Sans?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and I said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wow, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re spending the rest of our lives together.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d The pair went so far as to publish an anti-Comic Sans manifesto online and began selling a line of products. They affixed stickers to walls and billboards around their hometown boasting the slogan: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBan Comic Sans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Born in October 1994, Comic Sans would now be eligible for its quarter-life crisis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if it hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spent its first 25 years in an identity crisis. The idea for the font came when Mr. Connare was helping to develop an easy-to-use operating system for Microsoft. While sketching a talk bubble for \u00e2\u0080\u009ca cute little yellow dog,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Connare had an epiphany: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDogs don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk in Times New Roman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He decided the program needed a new font, zanier and more childlike, for which he took inspiration from comic books and graphic novels. From its inception, the font attracted eye rolls and outright pitchfork attacks. Mr. Connare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boss, Bob Norton, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a fan of it and axed it from the ill-fated program, called Microsoft Bob. But the font lived on in a Windows 95 Plus! pack. Paige Shelton, author of the mystery \u00e2\u0080\u009cComic Sans Murder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d set in a fictional typewriter repair shop, said that when the font was released \u00e2\u0080\u009call Helvetica broke loose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Comic Sans is what Ms. Shelton calls \u00e2\u0080\u009ca fun-times font,\u00e2\u0080\u009d manspreading across paper in strokes thicker than fair Cambria or no-nonsense Garamond. (Mr. Bierut said Helvetica, by contrast, is a \u00e2\u0080\u009ca call from H.R.\u00e2\u0080\u009d) The spacing, or kerning, between its letters is uneven because it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t designed for print. To type traditionalists, use of the font can signify frivolity or even disrespect. The website Comic Sans Criminal allows people to report its inappropriate uses (see: a sex offender registry, a doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diagnosis). In 2010, a Twitter employee shared that the site\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two most reliable sources of traffic are complaints about airlines and Comic Sans. Mr. Bierut said that Comic Sans has long been \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe default punch line in the design community.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meant to simulate the handwriting process, it can come off as inauthentic, he explained, like a packaged cookie when you expected homemade. It is \u00e2\u0080\u009cwillfully idiosyncratic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with its crooked lines and unevenly distributed weight. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt reads like a Mickey Mouse cartoonish voice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Bierut. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has this weird sense of dislocation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the Comic Sans hatred was never universal. Ty, the maker of Beanie Babies, used it. So did Electronic Arts Games, creator of The Sims. Scientists at CERN used the font in a landmark presentation about the Higgs boson particle, and Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers, used it to thank LeBron James for his service. It is also recommended by the British Dyslexia Association. In a post on its website, the American Institute of Graphic Arts said Comic Sans helps readers with disabilities because of its \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharacter disambiguation\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cvariation in letter heights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In May, Mr. Combs decided that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBan Comic Sans\u00e2\u0080\u009d project had \u00e2\u0080\u009cgotten out of hand\u00e2\u0080\u009d and changed his Facebook group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name to \u00e2\u0080\u009cUse Comic Sans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gotten to be so bad that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost cool again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. (His wife disagrees.) Mr. Connare said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used the font he created once in the last two decades, to write a letter of complaint about his broadband. The company gave him a \u00c2\u00a310 refund. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt certainly gets you attention,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.",

      "subtitle": "A quieter day in Washington provided a chance to look at how the still-nascent investigation is being received across the country.",
      "author": "Noah Weiland",
      "content": "This morning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s episode of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Daily\u00e2\u0080\u009d followed Representative Elissa Slotkin, a moderate Democrat, as she went to three forums in her mid-Michigan district \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including one at the East Lansing pie bakery where I worked the 5 a.m. shift in high school! Her takeaway: Many voters want an investigation that feels deliberate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no need to come out of a meeting where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard some new testimony and just start talking to the press about how this seals the deal for you, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. To follow up on the episode, I called my colleague Emily Cochrane this afternoon just after she landed in San Antonio, where she was planning to cover a run of town-hall-style events with Republican members of Congress to see how Texans were responding to the inquiry. Emily, you wrote this week about what constituents in three New York congressional districts are saying about impeachment. Not everyone was cheering for it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many wanted to talk about other things. What was on their minds? With the Democratic voters I spoke to, they were curious about impeachment and glad their members of Congress endorsed it. They wanted to rip the Band-Aid off, but they also wanted to know how policy was going to get done. Is there going to be some kind of gun reform? What are you doing to combat climate change? There had been a push to cancel this congressional break. But House Democratic leadership pushed back, saying that people needed to get home to explain impeachment to their constituents and assure them that other work was getting done. Max Rose, a Democrat who represents a somewhat conservative district, had been on the fence on impeachment. He used his town hall to announce his endorsement of the inquiry, and then got exactly zero questions about it. Why do you think that was? Mr. Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s town hall was about tolls and the commute from Staten Island to Manhattan. Even with climate change, there were questions about nuclear energy in the district. This is a huge moment in Washington, but the government still has to be funded, and local issues still resonate more. If you have one question, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more likely going to pick one about home. This week we saw growing public support for the impeachment investigation, including a Fox News poll released tonight that showed just over half of voters wanting Mr. Trump removed from office. This afternoon I stopped by the office of David Leonhardt, a Times opinion columnist here in Washington, to ask him what the numbers meant, and how much they shape the thinking of the White House and Congress. David, you wrote last week about how President Trump is losing what you called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbattle for public opinion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Should we be paying attention to that this early in the process? We should care about the polling because impeachment is an inherently political process. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like a murder trial where the only opinions that matter are that of the 12 jurors. If you look at history, Richard Nixon lost his job because he lost public support, and Republicans decided they needed to abandon him. Bill Clinton kept his job because he kept public support. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best way to track public sentiment? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early, so we should be careful about drawing sweeping conclusions. And you should almost never care about any single poll. Pay attention to aggregates of polls. As the impeachment investigation goes on, we should care about these polls because politicians are reacting to them. Polls are snapshots that they pay attention to, because their jobs ultimately depend on it. But other forms of expression matter. In the fight over Obamacare, town halls, rallies and phone calls to offices really affected members of Congress. How might Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval rating influence his thinking? His approval rating is more important for him than impeachment polls. Impeachment polls can turn on how a question is phrased: whether people think impeachment means removal or doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean removal, and so on. Approval ratings are more consistent. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got them going back through his entire presidency. The FiveThirtyEight average shows he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lost about 1.5 points in the past few weeks. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s small but meaningful, especially because it was already pretty low. The impeachment polling matters partly because it could end up being a preview of where his approval rating goes, either positively or negatively.",

      "subtitle": "Elizabeth Warren is seeking to find a balance \u00e2\u0080\u0094 disavowing fund-raisers with wealthy contributors while promising not to actually disarm in a potential matchup with President Trump.",
      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": "As Senator Elizabeth Warren has surged toward the top of the Democratic presidential field, she has found herself torn between two competing imperatives: maintaining her perceived purity from the influence of wealthy contributors and not ceding any financial advantage to President Trump, who is busy breaking fund-raising records. One of the centerpieces of Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anti-corruption message has been her pledge to forgo traditional big-money fund-raisers, which advisers believe has helped fuel her rise. From the start, Ms. Warren had said the ban only applied to the primary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not believe in unilateral disarmament,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said when she announced it in February on MSNBC. But in a reversal, she told CBS News in an interview posted late Tuesday evening that she would extend the pledge through the general election if she were to win the Democratic nomination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, for me this is pretty straightforward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Warren said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEither you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible. Or you think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about a grass-roots, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s build this from the ground up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pressed on whether that was her position \u00e2\u0080\u009cno matter how much money Donald Trump is raising,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Warren replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to do the big-dollar fund-raisers. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just not going to do it. The whole notion behind this campaign is that we can build this together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her aides confirmed the decision on Wednesday but layered on some caveats: While she would forgo fund-raisers for her campaign, she would headline open press events for the Democratic National Committee, which has traditionally served as a virtual extension of the nominee. Her spokeswoman, Kristen Orthman, said Ms. Warren was committed to helping Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u009cup and down the ballot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Powered by small donors, Ms. Warren has become one of the strongest Democratic fund-raisers of the 2020 field, raising $24.6 million in the last three months from more than 940,000 donations, second only to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who raised $25.3 million. Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new position on general election fund-raisers appears to be an effort to thread the needle between those on the progressive left urging her to permanently swear off soliciting big checks and Democratic officials and activists concerned that such a stand would endanger the party as Mr. Trump and the Republicans bank record sums of cash. Veterans of Democratic politics said the idea that fund-raising operations for the party nominee and the party itself would be completely independent was strained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce you are the Democratic nominee, you are the party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rufus Gifford, a former finance director for President Barack Obama, who has donated to multiple 2020 candidates but not to Ms. Warren. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou own the party. Your political operation takes over the D.N.C. You cannot divorce in any way fund-raising for the presidential campaign and the Democratic Party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The donation limits for the D.N.C. are actually far higher than those for direct contributions to campaigns. The D.N.C. can raise money in increments of $355,000; direct donations to a potential Warren general election committee would be limited to $2,800. Ms. Orthman said Ms. Warren would attend D.N.C. events that are open to the press to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake sure the Democratic National Committee, state and local parties, and Democratic candidates everywhere have the resources\u00e2\u0080\u009d they need. She also said Ms. Warren was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d including \u00e2\u0080\u009cno special access or call time with rich donors or big-dollar fund-raisers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Warren headlined a D.N.C. event in August, but she did not meet privately with large donors who attended. She is scheduled for another D.N.C. event next week. The Warren campaign declined to say whether it would create a joint fund-raising committee with the D.N.C., which is traditionally a big lure for contributors who want to support candidates up and down the ballot. Mr. Trump and his shared committees with the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the last three months. Henry R. Munoz III, who stepped down as finance chair of the D.N.C. earlier this year and has co-hosted a fund-raiser for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed arrangement left him confused. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know how that would work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Munoz said. Democrats, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave to do everything in their power to work together to create an infrastructure to do battle with the almost unlimited resources that this administration and that party will use to destroy what we believe in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Beyond the party itself, an array of Democratic super PACs are gearing up for 2020. Guy Cecil, the chairman of the biggest such group in the presidential race, Priorities USA, wrote on Twitter that regardless of Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision, it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cfull speed ahead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already up & running ads holding Trump accountable in key states & will be through November next year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cecil wrote. Ms. Warren has steadily risen in the polls throughout the year and has recently topped Mr. Biden in some surveys both nationally and in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Previously, she had been clear that her ban on fund-raisers applied only to the primary. MSNBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chris Hayes asked her that directly when she announced it (\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Warren replied). And in an interview with The New York Times over the summer, Ms. Warren said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primaries. This is Democrat against Democrat. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe in unilateral disarmament.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some of her rivals had sought to portray her stance as inconsistent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grass-roots donations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both in the primary and in the general,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said pointedly when announcing his campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quarterly financial haul. There has also been grumbling about the $10 million in leftover Senate funds she seeded her presidential campaign with, some of which was raised from major contributors. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are the only two Democrats to skip traditional fund-raising events in the primary, where candidates can collect checks of up to $2,800. Her announcement this week could appeal to more fervent supporters of Mr. Sanders, whose base Ms. Warren has been seeking to win over. Tension over how candidates raise their money is an age-old political issue. In the 2016 race, Mr. Trump railed against the influence of big donors in the Republican primary. But once he became the nominee, he quickly embraced the donor world. At the time, he said he did not see a contradiction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m raising money for the party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Lara Jakes",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 American diplomats who had pushed for the Trump administration to restore security funding to Ukraine were advised by the White House to play down the release of the money when it was finally approved, documents show. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep moving, people, nothing to see here \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brad Freden, the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acting deputy assistant secretary overseeing issues in Europe and Eurasia, wrote in a Sept. 12 email obtained by The New York Times. He said the National Security Council would not publicly announce that $141 million in State Department assistance was being restored after being held up in what the White House described as a normal review. The money is now at the heart of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats into whether President Trump withheld a total of $391 million in funding as he sought damaging information on his political opponents from Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newly elected leader. A series of previously unreported internal State Department emails reflect diplomats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 frustration with the unexpected freeze on funding that Congress had already approved. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe realize the strain this puts on posts and your ability to conclude grants and carry out programs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jim Kulikowski, the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regional assistance coordinator, wrote in an Aug. 5 email. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe currently await further guidance and will provide you with an update as soon as we know about next steps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kulikowski wrote in the message, which was sent to dozens of State Department employees, including diplomats in Kiev and in countries across Eastern Europe. The email did not explain why the assistance was being withheld. Trump administration officials said the funding had been frozen weeks earlier, before a July 25 telephone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. During that call, Mr. Zelensky said he was grateful for the security assistance that the United States had supplied to Ukraine, and made clear that he hoped to receive more. A Ukrainian official has said Mr. Zelensky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government did not learn of the funding delay until about a month later. The White House has said the review merely sought to ensure the money was properly spent. But the freeze irritated diplomats who questioned whether it was tied to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demands for Ukraine to investigate two politically fraught allegations: a widely debunked conspiracy theory about election tampering in 2016 and corruption at an energy company that employed the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. There is no evidence that the Bidens were involved in wrongdoing. Once the decision to freeze the aid became public in late August, a bipartisan group of lawmakers pressed the administration to reverse course, saying that holding up the money sent the wrong signal as a new Ukrainian government confronted a continuing military threat from Russia. William B. Taylor Jr., the top American envoy in Kiev, wrote in a Sept. 9 text message that it was \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In response, Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, wrote that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of any kind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sondland then suggested that the conversation continue by telephone, rather than by text. On Tuesday, the Trump administration blocked Mr. Sondland from testifying to the House in the impeachment inquiry. Officials were informed that the freeze had been reversed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the $141 million in foreign military financing would be released \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in a Sept. 12 email from the White House that was then sent around the State Department. \u00e2\u0080\u009cApparently, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have full visibility, decision made last night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kulikowski wrote. Mr. Freden said the Ukrainian government had already been told that the funds were forthcoming. But he urged State Department employees not to announce the reversal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUkrainians are aware, but N.S.C. said that in the spirit of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098hold\u00e2\u0080\u0099 being a normal review, there will be no public announcement that it has been lifted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote, referring to the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Security Council. Mr. Taylor said he planned to announce it in Ukraine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will inform President Zelensky as soon as he is out of a meeting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Taylor wrote to Mr. Freden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe then intend to make it public here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Freden responded in minutes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn terms of public messaging, N.S.C. is deliberately treating both the hold and its lifting as administrative matters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy advice is to keep your public messaging low-key as well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood advice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 thanks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Taylor emailed back. In an email on Wednesday, Mr. Taylor declined to comment. The State Department did not respond on Wednesday to several requests for comment. Some senior State Department officials readily volunteered information about the $141 million in aid as it was finally approved. At a breakfast meeting with reporters on Sept. 12, R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state for political military affairs, said that department officials were notifying lawmakers that morning that the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portion of aid to Ukraine was moving forward. He told reporters to anticipate other notifications to Congress \u00e2\u0080\u0094 specifically $250 million in military aid from the Pentagon, assistance the Defense Department announced later in the day would also move ahead. Lawmakers from both parties quickly announced the same day that the aid had been released. Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.",

      "content": "ROCHESTER, N.H. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday called for President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment for the first time, blistering Mr. Trump as a threat to American democracy and accusing him of \u00e2\u0080\u009cshooting holes in the Constitution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Escalating his language in an effort to rebut Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfounded claims about his actions with Ukraine, Mr. Biden set aside months of restraint to demand Congress move against the president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the former vice president told supporters here, accusing Mr. Trump of having \u00e2\u0080\u009cbetrayed this nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden even linked Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s false claims to the so-called Big Lie idea promulgated by the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou say it long enough, often enough, people may believe it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, invoking Goebbels by name. While Mr. Biden stopped short of calling for Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s removal from office, his new aggressiveness marked an acknowledgment that he must do more to both confront a president who is attacking him daily and to halt his slide in the polls in the Democratic primary. The former vice president has openly wrestled with how forceful to be with Mr. Trump, lamenting last week that the president wants to drag opponents into \u00e2\u0080\u009ca mud fight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Mr. Biden is increasingly sharpening his rhetoric under pressure from allies to embrace the head-to-head race. Mr. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the House because of his request to the Ukrainian government that it look into what Mr. Biden did with the country when his son, Hunter Biden, was working for a gas company there. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden again denied that he did anything improper as vice president. And he accused Mr. Trump, who has accused Mr. Biden of corruption and whose campaign is airing ads repeating the same claim, of acting entirely out of a desire to undermine his candidacy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to let Donald Trump pick the Democratic nominee for president, period,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Biden, who has fallen behind Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in a series of national and early nominating state polls. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s picked a fight with the wrong guy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president apparently watched the speech, or was told of it, because even before it was over he noted on Twitter that Mr. Biden had called for his impeachment and claimed the Bidens had \u00e2\u0080\u009cripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cJoe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Mr. Trump. There is no evidence that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from his overseas work or that his father intervened inappropriately with Ukraine or China, the other country Mr. Trump was alluding to in his tweet. The president has also urged China to look into the Bidens. Mr. Biden again denied that he did anything improper as vice president. He noted that his 2016 call to fire Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, was part of United States government policy under President Barack Obama. It also reflected the wishes of a group of Republican senators at the time, who sought Mr. Shokin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ouster because he was seen as unwilling to target corruption, Mr. Biden said. A longtime senator before he became vice president, Mr. Biden is deferential to congressional prerogatives and has resisted calling for impeachment, even as Ms. Warren and many of his other Democratic rivals have been outspoken in demanding it. Last month, when House Democrats began moving toward an impeachment inquiry, he said they should only do so if Mr. Trump did not cooperate with their investigation. Then last week he said he would let Congress \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo its job on impeachment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And at a later event on Wednesday, in Manchester, N.H., he nodded to his longstanding discomfort with impeachment, calling it \u00e2\u0080\u009ca God-awful thing for a nation to go through.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But as Mr. Trump and his allies wage near-daily political warfare against Mr. Biden, he has sought to mount a counteroffensive. He began his rebuttal in a speech last week in Reno, Nev., but on Wednesday he went even further. Speaking from a teleprompter and dressed formally in suit and tie, he used his first trip back to New Hampshire since the impeachment investigation got underway to both taunt and condemn Mr. Trump in remarkably stark language. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s afraid about just how badly I will beat him next November,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Biden, attempting to frame the general election as a contest between him and the president, and appealing to Democratic voters here and elsewhere who are consumed with finding a nominee who can oust Mr. Trump. But he also used his speech, which lasted just under 30 minutes, to warn of the damage he claimed Mr. Trump was doing to the country. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all laughed when he said could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Biden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no joke. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He argued that impeachment was crucial not just because of what the president had done but also in trying to curb Mr. Trump from committing additional abuses in office. For Mr. Biden, the question now is how to balance countering Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s onslaught with articulating his own policy vision and contrasting himself with his Democratic opponents. He sought to do all three in his appearance in Manchester, reciting many of his same lines about Mr. Trump at the outset of his speech before turning to his record on gun control and domestic violence prevention. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt takes a proven ability to get things done,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said. And, he reminded the audience in an unmistakable reference to Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raft of policy plans, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not electing a planner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Several Federal Reserve policymakers, at their most recent meeting, voiced concern that weaker business activity and investment could lead to slower hiring and consumer spending, according to minutes of the meeting published on Wednesday. The Fed cut interest rates for a second time this year at that meeting, in mid-September, after a reduction in July that was its first since the Great Recession. The moves are meant to insulate the economy from major fallout as trade tensions stoke uncertainty and a global slowdown bleeds into American factories. Policymakers at the September meeting expected the economy to continue growing steadily with the help of their rate cuts, the minutes showed. But they were increasingly worried about risks to that outlook from President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade war, the threat of a chaotic British exit from the European Union and protests in Hong Kong. \u00e2\u0080\u009cParticipants generally had become more concerned about risks associated with trade tensions and adverse developments in the geopolitical and global economic spheres,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the minutes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeveral participants mentioned that uncertainties in the business outlook and sustained weak investment could eventually lead to slower hiring, which, in turn, could damp the growth of income and consumption.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Federal Reserve has two main tasks: promoting maximum employment and maintaining stable inflation, which it defines as 2 percent annual price gains. To achieve those goals, policymakers adjust interest rates to try to keep the economy growing at a steady and sustainable pace. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee has become increasingly divided over how to achieve those objectives. That is because the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prospects have been clouded by the trade war and other uncertainties even as consumer spending and job growth have held up. Some policymakers favor lowering borrowing costs now to insulate the economy against potential shocks, arguing that changes in monetary policy affect the economy with a big lag. But others want to wait for a more pronounced weakening in the economic data, or worry that lowering rates could fuel financial bubbles. Three people voted against the decision to cut rates in September, the most dissents since Jerome H. Powell became chair last year. Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, did not want to lower rates, while James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, backed a bigger rate cut. Little has changed since the central bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s September meeting, and while key officials including Mr. Powell and Richard Clarida, the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice chair, have avoided signaling whether or when they will seek to lower borrowing costs again, many investors expect another rate cut when policymakers meet at the end of this month. Speaking in Denver on Tuesday, Mr. Powell said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolicy is never on a preset course and will change as appropriate in response to incoming information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He noted that while the job market was strong and inflation was rising toward the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2 percent target, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are risks to this favorable outlook, principally from global developments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite their positive assessment of the current economy, Fed policymakers were attuned to risks other than the trade war when they met last month, the minutes showed. Several noted that some statistical models suggested that the likelihood of a coming recession \u00e2\u0080\u009chad increased notably in recent months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But a couple of officials stressed that such models were difficult to interpret. Some were concerned that a prolonged inversion of the yield curve \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a common recession signal in which interest rates on longer-dated bonds fall below those on short-term debt \u00e2\u0080\u0094 could \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe a matter of concern.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And \u00e2\u0080\u009cseveral\u00e2\u0080\u009d were concerned about financial stability, citing a buildup of corporate debt, stock buybacks financed with low-cost debt and rapid lending in the commercial real estate market. Despite the mounting risks, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca few\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fed officials felt that markets were expecting too many Fed interest rate cuts, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that it might become necessary for the committee to seek a better alignment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump on Wednesday called a Turkish incursion into Syria \u00e2\u0080\u009ca bad idea\u00e2\u0080\u009d but reiterated his opposition to \u00e2\u0080\u009cendless, senseless wars,\u00e2\u0080\u009d striking a far milder tone than outraged members of Congress, foreign allies and officials in his own administration, who said the offensive must be stopped. And later in the day, after issuing that statement, Mr. Trump seemed dismissive of the plight of the Syrian Kurdish fighters who are in Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cross hairs. Speaking to reporters, the president said that while the  Kurds had fought alongside American troops against the Islamic State, or ISIS, they had done so out of self-interest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor their land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and noted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help us in the Second World War. They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help us with Normandy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith all that being said, we like the Kurds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. In his earlier statement, Mr. Trump said he was holding Turkey responsible for preventing the release of Islamic State fighters who were being held captive in the area and for ensuring \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat ISIS does not reconstitute in any way, shape or form.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even so, Mr. Trump limited his criticism of Turkey, making no mention of taking punitive action, while Republicans on Capitol Hill were sharply critical of Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for following through with a plan he disclosed to Mr. Trump in a phone call on Sunday. And Pentagon officials privately expressed their anger over Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sudden and unplanned shift in what had been American policy for years to oppose Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longtime desire to seize territory across its border with Syria. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close ally of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who often speaks and plays golf with the president, said in an interview that he had reached an agreement with Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, to offer \u00e2\u0080\u009csevere\u00e2\u0080\u009d sanctions legislation against Turkey, which Mr. Graham predicted would have \u00e2\u0080\u009cwidespread bipartisan support.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be seeing in the coming days is Congress filling in the vacuum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Graham said, likening Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s posture to President Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deep-seated aversion to engagement in Syria. \u00e2\u0080\u009cObama basically took a pass on Syria and the rest is history. We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to make that same mistake twice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a joint statement, Mr. Graham and Mr. Van Hollen said their bill would punish senior Turkish government officials and ban American military transactions with Turkey. The measure would also impose sanctions on Turkey for its purchase of a sophisticated Russian-made missile defense system. Mr. Trump has avoided enforcing those sanctions, which members of Congress insist are mandatory under a 2017 law meant to penalize countries for doing business with Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis invasion will ensure the resurgence of ISIS in Syria, embolden America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enemies including Al Qaeda, Iran and Russia, and launch yet another endless conflict in what had been, until today, one of the most safe and stable areas of Syria and a region experimenting with the best model of local governance currently available in that war-torn country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the senators said in their statement. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s step-back posture toward the Turkish incursion is also alienating some of the evangelical leaders who are his core supporters but who fear that Christian minorities in northeastern Syria \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some of whom have been under protection from the Kurds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would face danger from attack by Muslim-majority Turkey. The evangelical leader Franklin Graham appealed to his followers on Twitter to pray that Mr. Trump might \u00e2\u0080\u009creconsider\u00e2\u0080\u009d his decision, adding: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Turks have a dismal record on human rights & they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be trusted. Pray for the Kurds, Christians, & other minorities in this region.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Mr. Trump was not without his defenders. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who often speaks with the president and has repeatedly pushed him to avoid foreign conflicts, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u009cis stopping the endless wars and we will be stronger as a result. The Cheney/Graham Neocon War Caucus has cost us too much fighting endless wars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  But prominent Democrats also denounced the Turkish move, and criticized Mr. Trump for failing to coordinate his decision to pull back American troops from the area \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in effect clearing the way for Turkey to attack \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with American generals and allies. At the Pentagon, where more than five years of fighting alongside Kurdish troops in Iraq and Syria has now given way to standing aside as those same allies are attacked, some officials said there was more anger than they had seen at any point in Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidency. As recently as last week, Defense Department officials had been assured by Turkish military officials that they were not seeking to launch an invasion of Syria. Nor were officials expecting Mr. Trump, in his Sunday call with Mr. Erdogan, to open the door for a Turkish offensive by deciding to remove the 50 to 100 American troops in the northeastern portion of Syria, where Mr. Erdogan wants to create a \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe zone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A person briefed about the call said the discussion between Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan was wide-ranging, until Mr. Erdogan, in the second half of the conversation, complained that the United States was not fully complying with an agreement struck with Turkey in September to jointly create such a safe zone. Mr. Erdogan said he intended to unilaterally establish one immediately. Mr. Trump demurred, evidently believing that Mr. Erdogan would not be willing to risk the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ire. But Mr. Erdogan effectively \u00e2\u0080\u009ccalled the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bluff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the person said. What followed was a scramble to move American personnel from harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way in northern Syria. In the days since, Mr. Trump has made repeated references to his desire to withdraw from Syria and avoid the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstupid endless wars\u00e2\u0080\u009d against which he campaigned in 2016. But that has furthered the impression \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0both in the United States but, perhaps more important, in Turkey \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Mr. Trump had blessed Mr. Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposed incursion. Mr. Erdogan sees Syria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kurdish fighters as an enemy and wants to flush them out of a safe zone along his country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s southern border with Syria, which has been devastated by a civil war of more than eight years. The conflict has produced an exodus of roughly three million Syrian refugees into Turkey whom Ankara wants to relocate into a secured zone across the border. Mr. Trump warned on Monday that if Turkey did anything that he considered \u00e2\u0080\u009coff limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he has not clearly defined those limits. That supports the view of analysts who say the real red line for Mr. Trump and many members of Congress is not a matter of territory but rather the killing of Kurdish fighters. Soner Cagaptay, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he believed that Mr. Erdogan would calibrate any offensive to limit casualties that would prompt a major response from Congress and potentially humiliate Mr. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would say this is a war that is not a war,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cagaptay said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to see fighting of epic proportions. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coordinated and preorchestrated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In his remarks to reporters Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said that he was watching to see how Mr. Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offensive unfolded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see how he does it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe could do it in a soft manner; he could do it in a very tough manner. And if he does it unfairly, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to pay a very big economic price.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But national security officials are especially worried about how a Turkish offensive could affect the continuing fight against the Islamic State, which \u00e2\u0080\u0094 thanks in large measure to the Kurdish-led forces now under attack \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has lost its territorial holdings in Syria but which officials say has been gaining new momentum in Syria and Iraq. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know that terrorism in Syria does not stay in Syria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Erdogan, despite his claims, does not have the support of the international community for this operation and he refuses to assure the U.S. that he will guard ISIS detention facilities in the area and prevent ISIS from once again gaining a foothold in the region. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid we are dangerously close to the point of no return.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Federal programs to help Americans move away from disaster-prone areas are skewed by the income levels of communities seeking help \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rather than being based solely on the risk they face \u00e2\u0080\u0094 new data shows, blunting an important tool for helping people cope with climate change. Since 1989, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has bought and demolished more than 43,000 homes in flood-prone areas, a strategy meant to make communities less vulnerable to disasters. But which homes get selected for the buyouts depends as much on the wealth of the affected neighborhoods as on the actual level of danger that those areas are exposed to, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. The findings raise concerns that limited federal funding for adapting to climate change isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t helping the areas that need it the most, according to the paper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authors. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho benefits?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Katharine J. Mach, a professor at the University of Miami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science and the paper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead author. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a real potential for our responses in a changing climate to make the fat cats fatter, so to speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The paper is the latest evidence that even as the effects of global warming worsen, the United States is increasing its exposure to the dangers that arise from climate change. In many coastal states, flood-prone areas continue to see the highest rates of home construction. At the same time, the number of Americans with flood insurance has dropped significantly from its peak a decade ago. Economists warn that climate change could pose an even more severe risk to the housing market, and to the economy as a whole, than the recession of 2008. Federal buyout programs play an important part of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defenses against climate change, by giving homeowners in vulnerable places a way to relocate after a storm. That approach, sometimes called managed retreat, calls for pulling back from dangerous areas rather than continually rebuilding after each disaster, or pouring money into physical defenses such as sea walls and pumps. But homeowners can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apply for buyouts directly from the federal government. Instead, they rely on their local officials participating in those programs and deciding which homeowners can participate. The paper found that while most buyouts take place in areas with high flood risk, that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only factor at play. Many areas with equally high risk didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t receive funding, or received far less. The data show that buyouts were disproportionately concentrated in wealthy and densely populated counties. The reason, according to the report\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authors, is that local officials must request federal funds for buyouts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then successfully navigate a series of bureaucratic requirements \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and wealthier jurisdictions are more likely to have the staff and expertise necessary to do that. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuyouts require resources and capacity to administer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Caroline M. Kraan, another of the study\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authors. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot all governments may be equally able to access the program.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In addition, once local officials receive the federal funds, buyouts aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t evenly distributed within those counties, nor are they distributed according to risk levels alone. Instead, counties tend to use the money to buy and tear down homes in poorer neighborhoods, the authors found. There are different possible explanations for that, according to A.R. Siders, a professor at the University of Delaware and one of the paper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authors. Officials might feel that the poorer neighborhoods are genuinely the most vulnerable, Ms. Siders said. Those officials might also conclude that a given amount of federal dollars can go further purchasing a greater number of low-value homes, rather than buying just a handful of more expensive beachfront properties for the same amount. Another explanation, she said, could be that local officials \u00e2\u0080\u009care using the buyouts as an opportunity to get rid of neighborhoods that they don't feel are desirable parts of their community,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Siders said. The research, however, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t designed to examine which of those motivations was most prevalent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of these things are probably occurring,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. David Maurstad, FEMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputy associate administrator for insurance and mitigation, said the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grant programs \u00e2\u0080\u009care not designed to discriminate or address economic inequalities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cFEMA does not choose which properties participate in buyouts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Maurstad said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFEMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grant programs are designed to capitalize on the in-depth knowledge that each county floodplain manager and local official has regarding the needs of their communities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The new research is not the first to raise questions about the fairness or efficiency of FEMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buyout programs. Last month, the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental research and advocacy group, published a paper showing that it takes an average of more than five years between the time a flood strikes and when FEMA completes a buyout project. As a result, many people give up waiting for the money and rebuild instead. The reason buyouts take so long is that they require coordinated action by federal, state and local officials, as well as homeowners, according to Rob Moore, a senior policy analyst at N.R.D.C. and one of the authors of last month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paper. A delay at any one of those stages compounds the wait. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou could design a more cumbersome, complex process for buyouts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Moore said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to think really hard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still, the data also offers reason for optimism, according to Ms. Siders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo matter how difficult managed retreat sounds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe know that there are a thousand communities in the United States, all over the country, who have made it work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "Digital tax dodgers, take heed: International leaders have advanced a plan to prevent large multinational companies like Apple, Facebook and Amazon from avoiding taxes by shifting profits between countries. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an effort to de-escalate a global battle over how to tax the digital economy. The framework proposal, released Wednesday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, would allow countries to tax large multinationals even if they did not operate inside their borders. If international negotiators can now reach agreement on its key details, the plan will pave the way for new taxes not just on tech companies but on automakers and any other large multinational firms that operate online. Political and corporate leaders have clashed in recent years over how \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and where \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to tax companies that operate across national borders, particularly those that sell goods and services online. Traditionally, companies have paid taxes in the countries where their economic activity is generated. But in the digital economy, firms can \u00e2\u0080\u009cmove\u00e2\u0080\u009d the source of their profits, like patents and other intellectual property, to countries where tax rates are extremely low. That allows them to pay lower rates than companies that operate only in a single country like the United States. Many countries, particularly those in Europe, have moved to curb that practice by approving new taxes on large multinational companies that sell to their citizens but pay little or no tax to their countries. France approved a new digital tax this year that would hit large American tech companies like Google. The Trump administration responded by threatening tariffs on imported French goods, like wine, before the countries agreed to pause their plans in hopes of finding a multilateral agreement through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Wednesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release brought an 18-page framework plan that officials hope will form the basis of an international agreement on digital taxation as early as next year. That framework would fundamentally alter how and where companies that operated across national borders were taxed, though it leaves the details of those tax rates to future negotiators. It suggests new rules on where companies should pay taxes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 largely based on where their sales occur \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and on which profits are subject to taxation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a digital age, the allocation of taxing rights can no longer be exclusively circumscribed by reference to physical presence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the framework states. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe current rules dating back to the 1920s are no longer sufficient to ensure a fair allocation of taxing rights in an increasingly globalized world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The framework applies only to multinationals with annual revenues of about $825 million or higher. It excludes manufacturing suppliers and resource extraction companies, like oil companies. As it stands, the framework appears to be a victory for large, consumption-heavy countries like the United States, China and much of Western Europe, and a loss for so-called tax havens, like Ireland. Advancing the negotiating process is a win for large multinationals, even though a final deal could put them on the hook to pay more in taxes, because the alternative appears to be a series of country-by-country digital taxes that could be expensive to comply with. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmazon welcomes the publication of these proposals by the O.E.C.D., which are an important step forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a spokeswoman said Wednesday in an email. \u00e2\u0080\u009cReaching broad international agreement on changes to fundamental international tax principles is critical to limit the risk of double taxation and distortive unilateral measures and to provide an environment that fosters growth in global trade, which is vital for the millions of customers and sellers that Amazon supports around the globe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A Treasury Department spokesman said on Wednesday that the United States \u00e2\u0080\u009cis studying the O.E.C.D. Secretariat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal and is actively engaged in the process aimed at forging a consensus on international tax issues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d before reiterating the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opposition \u00e2\u0080\u009cto unilateral digital services taxes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The framework will be taken up for discussion by finance ministers from large countries, who are due to meet in Washington next week.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 A Pentagon counterterrorism analyst shared classified information with two journalists for more than a year, one of whom he was dating, according to an indictment unsealed on Wednesday. The analyst, Henry Kyle Frese, 30, was arrested on Wednesday at his office at the Defense Intelligence Agency, where he has worked since January 2017, first as a contractor and then as an employee, prosecutors said. His arrest was the latest in the Justice Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aggressive efforts to crack down on illegal leaks of classified information. Six people have been charged with unlawfully sharing government information since Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, vowed in August 2017 to ramp up the fight on leaks, said John Demers, the head of the department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Security Division. Until 2017, no one had been charged in leak cases since 2013. Law enforcement officials under President Barack Obama prosecuted more leak cases than all previous administrations combined. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeaks of classified information cause damage to national security,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Demers said in a statement announcing the charges against Mr. Frese. Law enforcement officials said that the indictment made clear that the government was not pursuing the journalists in this case. But federal prosecutors declined to say whether they had monitored the journalists or obtained their records or data. And the methods in the case \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a wiretap of Mr. Frese\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone, perhaps the most intrusive tool in criminal investigators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 arsenal \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0underscored the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aggression in hunting leaks to journalists. The Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s renewed pursuit of leakers has alarmed First Amendment advocates, who say the investigations can have a chilling effect on government employees who may choose to stay silent rather than alert journalists to wrongdoing. Such indictments are also regularly used by Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies to advance rhetoric about a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeep state\u00e2\u0080\u009d of government leakers seeking to undermine his presidency; reporters say their sources are often dedicated public servants concerned about malfeasance or abuse of power. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis indictment should serve as a clear reminder to all of those similarly entrusted with national defense information that unilaterally disclosing such information for personal gain, or that of others, is not selfless or heroic; it is criminal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zachary Terwilliger, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, where Mr. Frese was charged, said in a statement. Mr. Frese will make his initial appearance on Thursday in federal court in Alexandria, Va., where his case is being prosecuted. The F.B.I. said that it received court permission to wiretap Mr. Frese\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cellphone and intercept some of his text messages and phone calls. The government also received data from Twitter, where he often communicated with one of the reporters. Mr. Frese shared information classified as top secret with reporters multiple times as far back as April 2018, when he gained access to an intelligence report about an unnamed foreign country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weapons systems \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a topic unrelated to his counterterrorism work, according to court papers. Mr. Frese shared information from the report with Amanda Macias, a national security reporter at CNBC who was his girlfriend, according to court papers and social media posts. She published eight articles related to information from Mr. Frese and five intelligence reports, according to prosecutors, who identified her only as Journalist 1. Details in court papers about their communications, their social media accounts and their shared residential address made clear that Ms. Macias was Journalist 1. She did not respond to an email request for comment. In private messages sent over Twitter in late April 2018, Ms. Macias told Mr. Frese that an American military official knew nothing about the intelligence report he had shared with her. He called the denial \u00e2\u0080\u009cweird\u00e2\u0080\u009d and later searched a classified government computer system for related terms, and called Ms. Frese back. Within days, Ms. Macias was the first journalist to report that China had installed missiles and missile systems in the South China Sea. When she posted a link to the article on Twitter, Mr. Frese shared her tweet as well. In private messages, Ms. Macias also asked Mr. Frese to speak with another reporter, Courtney Kube, a veteran Pentagon reporter for NBC News, which like CNBC is part of NBCUniversal. Prosecutors identified Ms. Kube only as Journalist 2. She did not respond to an email seeking comment. Mr. Frese complied, saying in a message that he would speak to Ms. Kube if it helped Ms. Macias\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career \u00e2\u0080\u009cprogress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Last month, the government said, Mr. Frese gained access to two more intelligence reports and shared them with Ms. Kube. A spokesman for NBC declined to comment. The suggestion that one of the journalists was involved in a relationship with Mr. Frese may also cause problems for executives at NBC, who would be obligated to examine whether any ethical reporting guidelines were breached.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state of Minnesota since Richard M. Nixon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s victory there in 1972. But President Trump has long viewed it as the one that got away. Mr. Trump barely set foot in the state during his 2016 campaign, and his field organization on the ground was nonexistent: The lone Trump campaign staff member working the state was moved to Colorado before Election Day. But Mr. Trump lost Minnesota to his former rival Hillary Clinton by 1.5 percentage points, or less than 45,000 votes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe almost won it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said during a visit this year to a trucking company in a Minneapolis suburb. The difference between a victory and a loss, he said, would have been coming to the state to give \u00e2\u0080\u009cone more speech.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This time, the Trump campaign is determined not to let Minnesota go without trying. So on Thursday night, Mr. Trump will arrive in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic congressional districts in the country, for his first political rally since House Democrats began an impeachment investigation that threatens to engulf his presidency. It is a rare rally for Mr. Trump in a state he did not win in 2016, and takes him to the heart of opposition territory: In 2018, the city helped elect to the House Ilhan Omar, a Democratic woman of color who has become one of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite foils. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally at Target Center will be bolstered by a \u00e2\u0080\u009cWomen for Trump\u00e2\u0080\u009d event hosted by the second lady, Karen Pence, and Lara Trump, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter-in-law, on Wednesday in St. Paul. Vice President Mike Pence will hold his own round table on Thursday in nearby Lakeville. Meanwhile, Brad Parscale, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign manager, is planning to pour tens of millions of dollars into the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Minnesota operation, compared with the $30,000 the Trump campaign spent on the state last cycle. The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100. And the campaign and the Republican National Committee are outspending Democrats by about four to one on digital advertising, according to campaign officials and local Democratic Party officials. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a full-on major effort state campaign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we will have the resources behind it to make it count.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Minnesota Democrats said it felt as if their state was a true battleground for the first time in decades. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOver the last 25 years, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen an investment as robust and deep this early by a Republican presidential candidate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ken Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. Mr. Martin said it was clear to him that \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump and the Republicans believe they can win and are doing everything to make it so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Few states in the Midwest exemplify Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strengths, such as popularity in rural areas, as well as his weaknesses, such as his shaky standing in suburban areas, the way Minnesota does. Which group turns out in bigger numbers could determine who wins the state on Election Day. If Mr. Trump succeeds in flipping Minnesota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 10 electoral votes, it will probably mean that he has secured himself another four years in the White House. No Democratic candidate can carve a path to victory without Minnesota, and Trump officials are eager to put Democrats on defense there. One campaign official compared the dynamic to Republicans having to spend resources to defend a Republican stronghold like Indiana. But the changing makeup of the state has made Minnesota something of a microcosm for the Trump campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenge as it builds him a solid infrastructure nationwide: This time isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last time. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis election is much more a referendum on him and his performance as president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has managed to turn a lot of voters off through his conduct and performance. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to overcome that with field organizing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Garin noted that the suburban vote in Minnesota was much more significant than in neighboring Wisconsin, and Mr. Trump was consistently polling poorly in suburbs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA variety of factors have taken it from being a closely contested state to much more of a slingshot for Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Garin said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe kind of antics at his rallies that occur are unlikely to help him in Minnesota.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To win Minnesota, Mr. Trump would have to gain about 45,000 more votes than he did in 2016, while keeping Democratic turnout roughly the same as it was last cycle. A poll commissioned before his visit Thursday by Alliance for a Better Minnesota, a group aligned with Democrats, showed that 49 percent of respondents favored an impeachment inquiry, compared with 44 percent who believed it was a bad idea. The poll, conducted by Public Policy Polling, also found that 52 percent of respondents would vote for an unnamed Democratic opponent if the election were held today, compared with 42 percent who said they would vote for Mr. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had record turnout for a midterm election in 2018,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Martin said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was fueled in urban cores and suburbs. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to have to do better than he did in the suburbs and exurbs, and we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen that happening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For their part, Trump campaign officials are more focused on the Iron Range, the mining communities in the northern part of the state. In 2016, for instance, Mr. Trump won the states\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Eighth District in the north by 16 points. President Barack Obama won it by six points in 2012. That is where Trump campaign officials see an urban-rural divide that is trending in their direction, while the election of progressive lawmakers like Ms. Omar has pushed voters further in the direction of Democrats in urban areas. Iron Rangers in northern Minnesota have been fleeing the Democratic Party because of promises to end the fossil fuel industry, among others, according to local officials, who point to Representative Collin C. Peterson, a Democrat, as an example of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changing politics. Mr. Peterson, who represents Minnesota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Seventh District, won his race in 2012 by 26 points. In 2018, he eked out a victory with a much slimmer 4-point margin. In 2016, Mr. Trump won the Seventh District by 31.5 points. But the rural regions in the state have also seen a loss of population, while the suburbs, where Mr. Trump has done little to expand his appeal with voters, have grown. This week, Mr. Trump tried to capitalize on that divide by leaning into a fight with Jacob Frey, the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis, who wanted to charge the campaign about half-a-million dollars for the extra security required to host the presidential visit. Framing Mr. Trump as a victim, his campaign accused the mayor of trying to shut down the rally. In a statement, the campaign called Mr. Frey a \u00e2\u0080\u009cradical leftist mayor\u00e2\u0080\u009d who was \u00e2\u0080\u009cabusing the power of his office and attempting to extort President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election campaign by conjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security in an effort to block a scheduled Keep America Great rally.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The campaign ultimately settled the dispute without paying the additional funds. It was not clear whether the city or the arena would be footing the bill instead. But some Democrats said they worried Mr. Frey had inflamed a real divide in the state, emboldening people to go see Mr. Trump after a Democratic mayor appeared to try to tell them they could not. The heated back-and-forth hinted at the aggrieved tone Mr. Trump plans to strike at the rally Thursday night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday on Twitter.",

      "content": "The American military is moving to take as many as several dozen Islamic State detainees out of Kurdish-run wartime prisons in northern Syria, and already has two British men in custody who are notorious for their roles in the torture and killing of Western hostages, according to United States officials. The decision comes as the Turkish military moved into northern Syria after getting a green light from President Trump. Turkey is targeting the American-backed Kurds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 known as the Syrian Democratic Forces \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who were the primary allies of the United States in the fight against the Islamic State in Syria. The Turkish invasion called into question the militia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to continue securely holding some 11,000 captured ISIS fighters. The officials spoke cautiously about the transfer operation because it was still underway, but Mr. Trump spoke openly on Wednesday afternoon about the fact that the United States was taking \u00e2\u0080\u009ca certain number of ISIS fighters that are particularly bad\u00e2\u0080\u009d in order to make sure that they did not get out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are taking some of the most dangerous ISIS fighters out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said in remarks while signing some executive orders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken them out, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re putting them in different locations where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump had previously said that Islamic State detainees in northern Syria would become Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsibility, and it was not clear what his administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term plan would be for those who were instead coming into the American military\u00e2\u0080\u0099s custody. For now, the military was taking at least some of the men to Iraq, where the United States has a base where it has held a handful of Islamic State detainees with American citizenship before transferring them to domestic soil \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or, in one case, releasing a detainee in Bahrain. But their home countries have resisted repatriating them, Iraq has been reluctant to take many ISIS members captured in Syria, and there are legal challenges to taking them to the American wartime prison at Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo Bay, Cuba. However, the government does have an eventual plan for the two British men, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey: The Justice Department wants to bring them to trial in Virginia. They were part of a four-member British cell that the Islamic State put in charge of Western hostages, who nicknamed them the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeatles\u00e2\u0080\u009d because of their accents. Among their victims was James Foley, the American journalist who was beheaded in August 2014 for an ISIS propaganda video. Another member of the cell, Mohammed Emwazi, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cJihadi John,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is believed to have killed Mr. Foley. Mr. Emwazi was later killed in a drone strike. But a court fight in Britain has delayed their transfer. The lawsuit is over whether the British government may share evidence with the United States without an assurance that American prosecutors will not seek the death penalty. The British government has shown witness statements about the two men to the Justice Department, but testimony from British government officials would also probably be necessary at any trial. Mr. Elsheikh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother has filed a lawsuit seeking to block such cooperation because the United States government has not promised it will not seek to execute her son. Britain has abolished the death penalty. The American military had been making contingency plans to get a list of about five dozen of the highest-priority detainees from that group out of northern Syria since December, when Mr. Trump first announced that he would withdraw troops from the country before his administration slowed down that plan, one official said. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to let Turkey proceed prompted the military to start getting those prisoners out, lest they escape amid the chaos and as the Kurds pull guards out of the prisons to help fight. But the detainees were scattered among numerous makeshift prisons, and it was not clear how many on the list would ultimately be taken, the official said. The Washington Post earlier reported on the move to transfer custody of detainees, including the two British men. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to clear the way for Turkey to launch its operation into northern Syria is bringing to an abrupt crisis a long-simmering problem: About 50 countries have citizens in the Kurds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 prisons for ISIS fighters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and in the displaced persons camps where tens of thousands of ISIS women and children are held \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and have been reluctant to repatriate them, instead leaving them in the Kurds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hands indefinitely. The male fighters the Kurds are holding include about 9,000 local Syrians and Iraqis, as well as 2,000 foreign fighters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including scores from Western Europe. Many European law enforcement officials fear that if they repatriate their extremist citizens, they would be unable to convict them or keep them locked up for a long time. After Britain declined to bring Mr. Elsheikh and Mr. Kotey home for prosecution, instead stripping them of their citizenship, the United States government weighed various options for handling them itself before deciding to prosecute them in civilian court once it obtained all of the evidence it needed. A person familiar with the exchange said that Attorney General William P. Barr has asked Mr. Trump to make keeping the two British men detained a priority so they could eventually face prosecution in the United States. The president agreed to do so, the person said. The Trump administration had also toyed with sending the two British men to the American military prison at Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo Bay, Cuba, for a period of indefinite wartime detention without trial. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who is a close ally of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s but has criticized his Syria policy, has advocated that step. But the military opposes becoming more deeply involved in long-term detention operations, and there are steep legal obstacles to taking the men to Cuba. Among those challenges, transfer restrictions Congress imposed to block President Barack Obama from carrying out his plan to close the Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo prison would make it illegal to transfer the men, once at the base, to domestic American soil for an eventual trial before a civilian court, and the military commissions system at Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo is widely seen as dysfunctional. It is also not clear whether legal authority exists to hold Islamic State members \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as opposed to members of Al Qaeda \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in indefinite wartime detention. Once in Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo, the detainees would have the right to file habeas corpus lawsuits challenging the legality of their detention, raising the risk of a ruling that the larger war effort against ISIS has been illegal.",

      "author": "Elizabeth Williamson",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 As a lawyer in private practice, Pat A. Cipollone, now President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s White House counsel, told colleagues that there were two approaches to legal fights. One, he said, was like the Department of State, when the two sides would try to work out a deal to avoid painful and expensive litigation. The other, when the first failed, was the Department of War. As of this week, Mr. Cipollone has put himself squarely in the war camp when it comes to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense against the House impeachment inquiry. After earlier advocating that the president adopt a policy of transparency by releasing the document at the heart of the impeachment debate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with his Ukrainian counterpart \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mr. Cipollone has shifted course and is now leading a no-cooperation strategy that holds substantial political risks but also seems to suit his combative client in the Oval Office. It is a role that has pushed Mr. Cipollone, 53, to the center of a battle that could determine the course of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidency and potentially lead to a constitutional battle with far-reaching ramifications. In building an argument that Mr. Trump has no obligation to respond to demands for information from Congress, Mr. Cipollone, in a letter sent Tuesday to House Democratic leaders, laid out an extraordinarily broad view of executive authority that, if maintained, seems likely to be viewed skeptically by the courts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taking a leading role in this proceeding because of the institutional interests that are at stake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jay Sekulow, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the right man for the task. He has the right temperament and disposition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rudolph W. Giuliani, another of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers and a key player in the Ukraine affair, heaped praise on Mr. Cipollone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom a lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of view, the letter is close to brilliant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. But to critics of Mr. Trump, Mr. Cipollone is seeking to twist the law and stonewall an entirely legitimate inquiry from a coequal branch of government and undercut the ability of Congress to pursue its constitutionally mandated remedy of impeachment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot fathom how any self-respecting member of the bar could affix his name to this letter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d George Conway, a constitutional lawyer and the husband of Kellyanne Conway, a top aide to Mr. Trump, said on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pure hackery, and it disgraces the profession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cipollone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defiant posture toward Congress, Democrats said, was more about political positioning than a serious effort to articulate a legal and constitutional defense for Mr. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking a position that seems to me to be quite frivolous: that Congress doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any power to investigate most of what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investigating,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Neil Eggleston, who was the White House counsel in the Clinton and Obama administrations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of a last refuge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A well-known figure in Washington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s community of Catholic conservatives and anti-abortion activists, Mr. Cipollone came to the White House late last year after earlier having helped prepare Mr. Trump for the presidential debates in 2016 and advised his legal team during the special counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation into Russian interference in the campaign. But Mr. Cipollone generally keeps such a low public profile that even those who have known him for years differ on how to pronounce his last name (it is sip-uh-LOAN-ee). He drives a pickup truck and a Honda Pilot, into which he loaded a beloved desk chair for the move to the White House after his appointment last December. He has contributed substantially to Catholic charities and causes, but his political work has been largely behind the scenes, including his former law firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense of former Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin in a campaign finance case. The son of an Italian-born factory worker and homemaker, Mr. Cipollone spent much of his childhood in the Bronx. After his father was transferred to Kentucky, Mr. Cipollone attended Covington Catholic High School before returning to New York to attend Fordham University. A debate champion and intramural athlete, he worked days in Fordham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s computer center and summers in construction, factory and clerical jobs. He was the class of 1988\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valedictorian, graduating first in a class of 650 with a degree in economics and political philosophy. Already interested in constitutional law, he wrote a senior thesis on \u00e2\u0080\u009cSubstantive Due Process and the 14th Amendment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cipollone won a full academic scholarship to attend the University of Chicago Law School. There, he sank deep conservative roots, helping lead a student chapter of the Federalist Society. Mr. Cipollone served a clerkship with Judge Danny Julian Boggs, a Reagan appointee, on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. As part of the interview process, Mr. Cipollone took the judge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s famously difficult \u00e2\u0080\u009cgeneral knowledge\u00e2\u0080\u009d quiz, which he used to gauge knowledge beyond the law. In Mr. Cipollone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s year, potential clerks had to answer 64 questions, including, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was the Trail of Tears?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did the battles of Actius, Lepanto and Salamis have in common?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen and what was the Edict of Nantes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Judge Boggs said he had looked back in his files and could not find Mr. Cipollone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s score.) Judge Boggs recently had lunch with Mr. Cipollone in the White House mess. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI complimented him on not seeing his name in the paper,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the judge said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich means he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing a good job.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cipollone went from Judge Boggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chambers in Louisville to Washington, and a speechwriting job with William P. Barr, who was attorney general in the George Bush administration and was named attorney general by Mr. Trump a few months after Mr. Cipollone arrived at the White House. A fellow clerk, Jennifer Hall, recalled sitting in Judge Boggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bookshelf-lined chambers between Mr. Cipollone and another clerk, Stephen Vaughn, now a trade lawyer in Washington. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey would yell at each other over me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she recalled, \u00e2\u0080\u009clistening to Rush Limbaugh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cipollone and his wife, Rebecca Cipollone, have 10 children. The youngest is a 10-year-old son and the oldest a 26-year-old daughter, who works at Fox News for Laura Ingraham, the conservative commentator, who was introduced to Catholicism by Mr. Cipollone. Mr. Cipollone is a founder of the National Prayer Breakfast, participates in the anti-abortion March for Life, and events that draw Washington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Catholic elite, like the Red Mass, celebrated each year at St. Matthew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cathedral on the Sunday before the Supreme Court session begins. (Mr. Cipollone was absent when the event was held this past weekend.) After his stint with Mr. Barr, Mr. Cipollone joined the law firm Kirkland & Ellis in Washington. In the mid-1990s, he moved his family to Connecticut and took a job as general counsel for a Kirkland & Ellis client, the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization and multibillion dollar insurance company. He later rejoined the firm, then left for a partnership at Stein, Mitchell, Cipollone, Beato & Missner, where he worked on Mr. Walker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, among others. Melanie Sloan, a law school classmate who works with the liberal watchdog organization American Oversight, said she called Mr. Cipollone for help in a complicated legal matter after classmates recommended him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was kind and happy to help me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like too many people in Washington would take a call from somebody they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been in touch with 20 years and be right there to help. And I never got a bill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cipollone earned nearly $7 million at Stein Mitchell in 2017 and 2018, according to his White House financial disclosure report. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith every client, with everybody he sat in front of, he used the term \u00e2\u0080\u0098off ramps,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Jonathan Missner, a partner of Mr. Cipollone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the firm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pat. He looks for off ramps, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good at it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is also true, he said, that Mr. Cipollone \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan be a pit bull \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Department of War.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

The move \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which had been widely anticipated \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was announced Wednesday night by Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer Jay Sekulow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have known Trey for years and worked with him when he served in Congress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sekulow said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis legal skills and his advocacy will serve the president well. Trey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s command of the law is well known and his service on Capitol Hill will be a great asset as a member of our team.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Gowdy, a former prosecutor who served four terms in the House before resigning in January, met with Mr. Trump for lunch on Tuesday at the White House. He is expected to be a presence on television defending the president. As chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, Mr. Gowdy led a two-year investigation into the 2012 attack in Libya that was sharply criticized by Democrats as a vehicle for Republicans to investigate Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time and went on to become the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee. Among the members of the committee was Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, then a Republican congressman from Kansas. Mr. Gowdy was particularly critical of the State Department for not complying with requests for documents, and those past comments about the importance of responding to document requests are likely to resurface in any defense of Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal team is not expected to expand substantially. Another of his personal lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, is himself at the center of a controversy over Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone call with the Ukrainian president asking for an investigation into Hunter Biden, the younger son of one of his leading 2020 Democratic rivals, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. In addition to Mr. Sekulow, the president had relied heavily on a small group of lawyers with experience as federal prosecutors to deal with the investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian election interference. But the impeachment inquiry, announced last month by House Democrats, might require a lawyer who can aid with a Senate trial.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 House Democrats prepared on Wednesday to force the Trump administration anew to answer questions in their impeachment investigation, one day after President Trump and the White House declared that they would defy Congress in one of the most extraordinary assertions of executive authority in modern times. House chairmen leading the impeachment inquiry planned to issue additional subpoenas for witness testimony and records related to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Ukraine as soon as Thursday, lawmakers and aides said, after a pause for the Jewish High Holy Days. They want to force executive branch officials to answer to their demands, generating a detailed record of refusals that could shape an impeachment article charging Mr. Trump with obstructing Congress. Democrats also still see other meaningful avenues for gathering evidence that go around the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defiance, including questioning private citizens, former officials, career diplomats near retirement and the whistle-blowers whose revelations fueled the inquiry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is more we want to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the second-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. He called the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stonewalling \u00e2\u0080\u009ca brazen political move to try to align what has been a fragmented and uncertain strategy to defend the president.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 investigation earned a prominent endorsement as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading presidential candidate, said in a speech on Wednesday in New Hampshire that Mr. Trump should be impeached for \u00e2\u0080\u009cshooting holes in the Constitution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden set aside months of restraint complicated by the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unsubstantiated allegations about Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own dealings with Ukraine. But the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promise to put a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfull halt\u00e2\u0080\u009d on cooperating with the impeachment inquiry was likely to force Democrats to more quickly confront questions about how long and how extensively to investigate Mr. Trump when ample evidence of his actions is already in the open. So far, the Democrats have secured public support for their inquiry. Polls show that a majority of the public backs it, but if the White House successfully stanches the flow of evidence and lawmakers extend their investigation without delivering significant new findings, that support could erode. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery new piece of information has corroborated the basic facts, which are devastating for the president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York and a member of the Intelligence Committee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many smoking guns are we going to get? The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own words incriminate him. Every supporting document we have seen further supports the devastating facts we are learning more about every day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But moving too quickly toward drafting articles of impeachment could expose Democrats to charges that their inquiry was a rush to tarnish the Trump presidency rather than a pursuit of the truth. Mr. Trump and other top administration officials, as well as his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, embarked in recent months on a campaign to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to open investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically. A whistle-blower complaint helped bring the scandal more fully into public view and prompted the impeachment inquiry, and Democrats say they want to ensure that they are fully scrutinizing the facts before they move forward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is another risk, which is you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to the bottom of the story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Himes said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWas Rudy Giuliani running his own State Department? What other people were pressured to go along with this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charged assertion late Tuesday that it would try to stymie the inquiry came in a letter from Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, but the document read more like a political argument than a legal one. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPut simply, you seek to overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the president they have freely chosen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cipollone wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany Democrats now apparently view impeachment not only as a means to undo the democratic results of the last election, but as a strategy to influence the next election, which is barely more than a year away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [As the White House counsel, Mr. Cipollone is building a case for defiance on impeachment.] Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he was ready for a long fight with the Democrats but implied that he might reconsider if the House were to hold a vote authorizing the inquiry and granting Republicans and the White House new powers to call and cross-examine witnesses in the inquiry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would if they give us our rights,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of Democrats. And Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s congressional allies continued to try to undercut the impeachment case. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he would invite Kurt D. Volker, the former United States special envoy to Ukraine, to testify in public if the House did not release of a transcript of its private interview with him. Mr. Volker helped try to secure commitments from Mr. Zelensky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government to investigate corruption, serving as an intermediary between the Ukrainians, Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani. House Democrats released damaging text messages that Mr. Volker shared showing his conversations with other American diplomats and a top Ukrainian aide. But Republicans argued that Democrats were trying to cover up the fact that he told investigators behind closed doors that he saw nothing untoward between the Trump administration and the Ukrainian government. Democratic leaders have made clear that they view Mr. Cipollone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter as an invalid legal document and warned Mr. Trump and other potential witnesses that ignoring subpoenas would carry consequences. Speaker Nancy Pelosi retorted to Mr. Trump late Tuesday that he was not \u00e2\u0080\u009cabove the law\u00e2\u0080\u009d and hinted that any efforts to undercut Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation would only fuel her impeachment case. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Other Democrats more explicitly pointed to one of the three articles of impeachment the House Judiciary Committee approved in 1974 charging Richard M. Nixon with failing to provide information to House inquirers. House leaders have signaled that they are highly unlikely to take any of the Ukraine-related disputes over information into court, as they did when the White House blocked earlier requests from congressional Democrats seeking to conduct oversight. Though the House continues to litigate those earlier cases in the courts, new lawsuits would take far longer to resolve than the amount of time that Democrats believe they have to decide on impeachment. Though they did not issue their request publicly, Democrats moved on Wednesday to line up at least one additional witness deposition, with a former White House foreign policy adviser, and requested she produce documents related to their inquiry. Fiona Hill, who until this summer served as senior director for Europe at the National Security Council, was expected to appear Monday for a deposition, two officials involved in the inquiry said. Ms. Hill turned over her responsibilities shortly before Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July phone call with Mr. Zelensky. Axios first reported the request. Two key State Department figures will also face choices in the coming days about whether to step down and testify to Congress or remain in the administration and keep quiet, according to current and former diplomats. William B. Taylor Jr., America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top diplomat in Ukraine, has already retired twice from the State Department and was called back into service most recently to go to Kiev. He has already threatened to quit once in protest over Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ukraine policy, according to the text messages that Mr. Volker shared with congressional investigators. Marie L. Yovanovitch, who was forced out by the Trump administration as ambassador to Ukraine, is teaching at Georgetown University and nearing the end of her foreign service career. If she wants to tell her story to Congress, she will have no choice but to quit, the current and former officials said. But even if they do resign, both Mr. Taylor and Ms. Yovanovitch could face hurdles to testifying in the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump could seek to tie up both officials\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eyewitness accounts in court by threatening legal action. Congressional investigators also believe they can glean important information from private citizens whom the White House cannot claim executive privilege over and would also have a more difficult time evading subpoenas. Most prominent among them is Mr. Giuliani, who appears to have orchestrated the monthslong effort to secure Ukrainian government support for investigations into Mr. Biden and his son and another unfounded theory about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election. Investigators have subpoenaed Mr. Giuliani for a vast set of records, to be delivered early next week. The House is prepared to issue subpoenas to two associates of Mr. Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who helped him try to stir up investigations in Ukraine, if they do not show up for scheduled depositions this week. The men worked to gather information in Kiev about the Bidens and matters related to the 2016 election. Mr. Parnas also helped connect Mr. Giuliani and Ukrainian prosecutors. And then there are the whistle-blowers whose accounts have provided a road map to investigators. Lawmakers are finalizing arrangements to talk to the first whistle-blower, who may be able to provide additional information or investigative leads. The whistle-blower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers have confirmed that they are also representing a second official who had more direct knowledge of the effort to pressure Ukraine. Lawmakers are also likely to want to speak to that official.",

      "content": "Bernie Sanders acknowledged on Wednesday that he knew he had suffered a heart attack three days before his campaign released that information, but he defended the decision to keep those details private. Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign had been inundated with questions from the news media last week as he recovered at a hospital in Las Vegas, and speculation about whether he had had a heart attack spread on social media and among voters. Campaign officials waited until Mr. Sanders was released from the hospital on Friday, smiling and waving to news reporters, before disclosing that he had. In an interview with NBC News, Mr. Sanders said a doctor at an urgent care facility in Las Vegas, where he went last Tuesday night after experiencing chest pain, had informed him that he was having a \u00e2\u0080\u009cheart event.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The interviewer then asked if the doctor had said he was having a heart attack, to which Mr. Sanders said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His campaign did not announce that until Friday, saying only that doctors had inserted two stents to open a blocked artery \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a fairly common procedure. A heart attack, known medically as a myocardial infarction, means that there was at least some damage to the heart muscle. Mr. Sanders, 78, rejected the idea that his campaign had showed a lack of transparency in not disclosing the information more quickly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept that. I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a media thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told NBC, adding that his campaign had been trying \u00e2\u0080\u009cto understand what in fact is going on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we did it appropriately and did it as quickly as we could,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo apologies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His wife, Jane Sanders, said in an interview with The New York Times that she had received the heart attack news on Thursday, and that it was her decision to wait to release that information until her husband was discharged the next day. Mr. Sanders and his family were dealing with another crisis at the same time: the cancer diagnosis of his daughter-in-law, Rain\u00c3\u00a8 Riggs. Ms. Riggs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who was married to Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son Levi Sanders \u00e2\u0080\u0094 died this weekend at age 46. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard it on Thursday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Sanders said, referring to her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart attack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut frankly, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thinking about the campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked in the NBC interview what voters should think with regard to the future of his campaign, Mr. Sanders said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople should think that I had a procedure which hundreds of thousands of people a year have. People should think that according to the doctors, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m on the way to a full recovery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Breathtaking in scope, defiant in tone, the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refusal to cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry amounts to an unabashed challenge to America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longstanding constitutional order. In effect, President Trump is making the sweeping assertion that he can ignore Congress as it weighs his fate because he considers the impeachment effort unfair and the Democrats who initiated it biased against him, an argument that channeled his anger even as it failed to pass muster with many scholars on Wednesday. But the White House case, outlined in an extraordinary letter to Democratic leaders on Tuesday, is more a political argument than a legal one, aimed less at convincing a judge than convincing the public, or at least a portion of it. At its core, it is born out of the cold calculation that Mr. Trump probably cannot stop the Democrat-led House from impeaching him, so the real goal is to delegitimize the process. Just last week, Mr. Trump acknowledged that Democrats appeared to have enough votes to impeach him in the House and that he was counting on the Republican-controlled Senate to acquit him. By presenting the inquiry as the work of an unholy alliance of deep-state saboteurs and Democratic hatchet men, he hopes to undermine its credibility, forestall Republican defections and energize his voters heading into next year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a general matter, painting the process as highly partisan should rally the G.O.P. and Trump base, as those groups will see the current inquiry as merely a continuation of the past three years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a Washington research organization, and a student of conservative thought. But it may also harden opposition to Mr. Trump, bolstering the impression that he considers himself above the law. That could build support for an article of impeachment that charges him with obstructing Congress in addition to any related to his effort to pressure Ukraine for damaging information about his Democratic adversaries. The eight-page letter signed by Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, and sent to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats outlined a bevy of grievances about the House inquiry, some procedural and others political. It argued that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis purported \u00e2\u0080\u0098impeachment inquiry\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d was not valid because the House did not vote to authorize it, as it did in the cases of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton, with Ms. Pelosi taking it upon herself instead to declare the existence of an impeachment process by fiat. It complained that Republicans have not been granted subpoena power of their own and that the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers have not been allowed to attend closed-door interviews, cross-examine witnesses or call their own witnesses to testify. But it also threw in a hodgepodge of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite objections, essentially memorializing some of his many Twitter blasts at Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, who is leading the inquiry and has become the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief target. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou look at all the irregularities, you can come to the conclusion that this is an illicit hearing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer, said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the first time that a president hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had the ability to have his party to call witnesses in the preliminary phase. It sounds like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re singling him out for unfair treatment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Constitutional scholars, though, were not impressed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt looks like a pathetic attempt to make a legal argument when the president is really expressing rage at the Congress for trying to stop him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Corey Brettschneider, an impeachment expert at Brown University. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sad about it is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so poorly drafted and the legal arguments are so nonexistent that you wonder who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advising the president.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and former senior Justice Department official under President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position was more political than constitutional. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe White House letter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal objections don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have merit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe letter, like the \u00e2\u0080\u0098official impeachment inquiry\u00e2\u0080\u0099 itself, is a hardball tactic designed to achieve maximum political advantage\u00e2\u0080\u009d before the public. Indeed, it could ultimately end up being a negotiating position. Mr. Trump, who on Tuesday denounced the \u00e2\u0080\u009ckangaroo court,\u00e2\u0080\u009d told reporters on Wednesday that he could change his mind and cooperate if the House voted to formally authorize the impeachment inquiry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, that sounds O.K.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would if they give us our rights. It depends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As a matter of historical precedent, Mr. Cipollone was correct in saying that Mr. Clinton and his lawyers and Democratic allies were eventually granted more rights during his impeachment in 1998 than Mr. Trump has been, at least so far. Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer, for instance, was given the opportunity to cross-examine his main accuser, the independent counsel Ken Starr, during an open House Judiciary Committee hearing. But the Constitution makes no guarantees of such rights for a president facing impeachment, simply saying that the House \u00e2\u0080\u009cshall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Indeed, the House impeached President Andrew Johnson in 1868 without even drawing up articles of impeachment until after the vote. Legal experts said nothing in the White House letter justified a president or his administration unilaterally defying congressional subpoenas. In fact, such resistance has been used against presidents in past impeachment efforts. One of three articles of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee against Mr. Nixon before he resigned in 1974 charged that he \u00e2\u0080\u009cwillfully disobeyed\u00e2\u0080\u009d congressional subpoenas, thereby \u00e2\u0080\u009csubstituting his judgment as to what materials were necessary for the inquiry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In his report to Congress in 1998, Mr. Starr argued that among the grounds for impeachment was what the prosecutor considered Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrivolous\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cpatently groundless\u00e2\u0080\u009d assertions of executive and other privileges to thwart a perjury and obstruction of justice investigation stemming from the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affair with Monica Lewinsky. In that case, though, the House opted against including such a charge in the articles of impeachment passed against Mr. Clinton. In some ways, Mr. Trump is employing a version of Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategy, albeit on steroids. During Mr. Starr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation, Mr. Clinton repeatedly sought to block testimony or documents, only to be overruled by the courts, just as Mr. Nixon was in the Supreme Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s groundbreaking and unanimous U.S. v. Nixon decision. Unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Clinton finally agreed to testify under oath, although only after refusing six times and eventually being subpoenaed by Mr. Starr. When the Republican-led House took up the matter, it did little original investigating of its own, relying primarily on Mr. Starr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s findings, so there were not the sort of subpoenas to resist the way Mr. Trump is doing now. But Mr. Clinton likewise felt outrage about the effort to impeach him, convinced that it was a partisan witch hunt, and he set about discrediting it with the public. House Republicans rejected protections and limits sought by Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team, and his Democratic allies attacked the process, accused the other side of railroading the president and made it an us-versus-them fight to keep wavering Democrats on Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side. House Democrats privately called their strategy \u00e2\u0080\u009cwin by losing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d reasoning that the more process motions they lost on partisan votes, the more illegitimate the effort would seem. In the end, the House voted almost entirely on party lines to impeach Mr. Clinton and, with Democrats sticking by him, the Senate voted to acquit him after a trial \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the scenario that, flipping the parties, looks most likely to repeat itself with Mr. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn one respect, President Trump seems to be borrowing from the Clinton White House playbook,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ken Gormley, the author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Death of American Virtue\u00e2\u0080\u009d about Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battle with Mr. Starr. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is attempting to throw gasoline over the entire impeachment process in the House and light a match in order to cause a conflagration and treat the entire process as illegitimate from the start.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, Mr. Gormley added, Mr. Trump is taking Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategy even further by refusing any cooperation at all and advancing the theory that the impeachment is an unconstitutional effort to overturn the 2016 presidential election and therefore he can ignore it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot surprisingly, President Trump is adopting a take-no-prisoners approach to this new threat that presents itself to his presidency, just has he has done, often with great success, when previous threats have presented themselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Mr. Gormley, the president of Duquesne University. While Democrats ponder going to court, Mr. Trump will take his case to the court of public opinion, or at least his base. He has scheduled three campaign rallies in the next week, starting Thursday in Minnesota, then Friday in Louisiana and then next Thursday in Texas. It seems safe to assume that he will have something to say about impeachment.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The Trump administration plans to soon issue licenses allowing some American companies to supply nonsensitive goods to the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, according to people familiar with the matter, a step that could cool tensions between the United States and China as trade talks resume this week. In a meeting last week, President Trump gave the green light to begin approving the licenses, which will allow a select few American companies to bypass a ban his administration placed on Huawei this year. In May, the Trump administration placed Huawei and dozens of its affiliates on the entity list, citing national security concerns. That move blocked Huawei from buying parts and obtaining technology updates from companies like Google and Micron without seeking approval from the United States government. The ban has not technically gone into effect. The administration issued a temporary reprieve to allow Huawei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suppliers and users of its products more time to find alternate arrangements. But the designation has been a significant source of tension between the United States and China, which considers Huawei central to its ambitions for building the next generation of wireless networks, known as 5G. The Trump administration originally said that it would approve licenses to continue selling to Huawei after Mr. Trump met with President Xi Jinping of China in Osaka, Japan, in June. But no licenses have since been issued, raising speculation that the administration was withholding them as leverage in trade talks. A spokesman from the Commerce Department, which is responsible for the licenses, said in an email that \u00e2\u0080\u009cas of right this moment, the status quo holds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to allow licenses could help smooth the path to a trade deal. Negotiators from the United States and China are meeting in Washington this week for their 13th round of trade talks and officials are trying to agree on terms that would address Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criticisms of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic practices but still be acceptable to Beijing. Mr. Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods this month and to impose another slew of tariffs in December if Beijing does not agree to concessions that Washington has been demanding. But some in the Trump administration have been eager to avoid further tariff increases and are pushing for a more limited agreement, which would end a trade war that has dragged on for more than a year. It is not clear whether the president would agree to a limited pact or whether such a deal can be struck. China has continued to resist many of the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demands to make more transformative changes to the way it runs its economy. The two countries have been on the cusp of an agreement before, only to have the arrangement fall apart. Approving licenses that allow American companies to supply so-called general merchandise to Huawei is likely to be seen as a gesture of good will, though its practical effects may be limited. Despite the ban, many American companies have continued supplying goods to Huawei by finding ways to avoid labeling goods as American-made and channeling more goods produced outside the United States to the company. In an earnings call in June, the chief executive of the American chip maker Micron, Sanjay Mehrotra, said the company had briefly stopped shipments to Huawei, but then resumed sales after Micron reviewed the entity list rules and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdetermined that we could lawfully resume\u00e2\u0080\u009d shipping a subset of products.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 American and Chinese officials met for the 13th round of trade negotiations on Thursday amid growing expectations of a limited deal that could ease tensions and address some of President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerns about China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic practices. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had a very, very good negotiation with China,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said on Thursday afternoon, adding that the two sides would continue discussions on Friday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going very well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But administration officials are separately weighing options that could inflict additional economic pain on Beijing as the United States continues looking for ways to force China to change longstanding rules that have put American companies at a disadvantage. The ideas under consideration would move the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negotiating tool of choice beyond tariffs toward limiting China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s access to American capital markets and imposing greater scrutiny on its companies, according to people familiar with the discussions. Administration officials, including members of the National Security Council, have begun pressing the Securities and Exchange Commission to increase scrutiny of Chinese firms. They are also looking for ways to reduce the exposure of American retirement funds to certain Chinese companies. Many of the efforts have been proceeding independently from the trade talks and are fueled by longer-term considerations of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic and security threats. Some White House advisers now view the escalation options as an additional lever to force China to make the kinds of deep economic concessions that have so far proved elusive in the talks, which have dragged on for more than a year. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top trade negotiator, greeted the Chinese vice premier, Liu He, on the steps of the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The meetings stretched into the afternoon, and at one point a black S.U.V. was seen delivering large brown bags from Clyde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, a Washington restaurant, for a working lunch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBig day of negotiations with China,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday morning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A U.S. Chamber of Commerce official briefed by both negotiating teams said that the United States and China could announce a limited trade agreement this week that would prevent Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planned tariff increase from going into effect this month and set rules around how China manages its currency. Myron Brilliant, the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the Chamber of Commerce, said that a more comprehensive pact could still be announced but that the scope of the deal would depend on what Chinese negotiators offered. The Trump administration could also contemplate removing the threat of additional tariffs that are scheduled to be imposed in December or roll back some of the tariffs it has already levied on more than $360 billion of Chinese goods based on what the Chinese negotiating team offers, he said. There have been some recent signs of accommodation between the two countries in recent weeks. China has resumed purchases of American agricultural goods. And in what is likely to be viewed as a gesture of good will by the Chinese, the Trump administration plans to  approve licenses soon that will allow some companies to sell nonsensitive goods to the Chinese telecom provider Huawei, which has been blacklisted from buying American products. But China has resisted many of the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demands to make more transformative changes to the way it runs its economy. Chinese officials appear unlikely to agree to the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longstanding demands that Beijing limit its subsidies to Chinese firms, change its policies surrounding the treatment of data or make other structural changes, people familiar with the negotiations said. The potential for such a limited agreement has fueled private deliberations within the White House on options for escalating economic pressure on China. Officials have held meetings in recent weeks to consider options if the current round of negotiations fails to address the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary concerns. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top economic advisers have publicly played down the discussions, which have centered on tightening scrutiny of Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges and limiting the direct exposure of government-run retirement funds to China. Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, acknowledged on Tuesday that the administration was looking for ways to protect Americans who were investing in Chinese companies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve opened up a study group to take a look at it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kudlow said on the Fox Business Network. But the options under consideration go further than that. According to a memo circulated within the White House and reviewed by The New York Times, the administration is studying a menu of actions that, if carried out, would most likely rattle the Chinese government. The memo was drafted by Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute and an outside adviser to the White House. It proposes holding Chinese companies and their employees criminally liable for financial disclosure violations, broadening the criteria that could get prominent Chinese companies blacklisted in the United States and blocking public and private pension funds and university endowments from certain Chinese investments. Other options go beyond financial scrutiny of Chinese companies. The memo describes the possibility of fostering deeper ties between the United States and Taiwan and disrupting the flow of capital between Hong Kong and mainland China if it is determined that Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s autonomy is not being respected. It also lays out legislation in Congress, which Mr. Trump has yet to endorse, that would impose sanctions on China for activity in contested areas of the South China Sea and crack down on Chinese-funded Confucius Institutes at American universities. Mr. Pillsbury declined to comment on his conversations with the White House but acknowledged that he had been analyzing such possibilities for a coming study on China strategy for the Hudson Institute. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt appears that tariffs alone are not enough, but we also need to meet some of the Chinese demands to get the kind of deal the president wants,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Pillsbury said. A White House spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tariffs have already pushed some companies to move their operations out of China. But the raft of new investment restrictions and export controls that the administration is mulling would further sever supply chains and discourage financial integration between the countries, potentially to the detriment of financial markets. On Monday, the White House clamped down on Chinese firms it accused of human rights violations by adding eight companies and 20 government organizations to an entity list that will prevent them from buying American products. On Tuesday, the State Department announced visa restrictions for Chinese officials allegedly involved in the detention and abuse of Muslim minorities. An array of initiatives related to American capital markets and investments made by retirement funds in Chinese entities are also under consideration. The most advanced discussions have centered on the Thrift Savings Plan, the retirement plan for federal employees and the military. As of next year, that plan, which holds nearly $50 billion in assets, is expected to begin investing in an index fund that includes more Chinese and Russian companies, as part of an effort to diversify its exposure. The index fund includes companies that the United States government has imposed sanctions on \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, which was among the companies blacklisted on Monday. It also includes AviChina Industry & Technology, an affiliate of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major military aircraft and weapons manufacturer; ZTE, which was hit with sanctions for providing technology to North Korea and Iran; and several Russian companies that the Treasury Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Foreign Assets Control has put under sanctions. Officials have also been discussing efforts to close loopholes that give Chinese companies access to American capital markets with less stringent disclosure requirements than American firms or those from other countries. Chinese law requires the records of companies based in China to be kept there, and restricts the kind of documentation that auditors can transfer out of the country. The rules mean that hundreds of Chinese firms, with a collective market capitalization of more than $1 trillion, have received looser oversight than companies in other jurisdictions, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. A bipartisan group of senators has introduced legislation that would force Chinese companies to comply with S.E.C. disclosure regulations or be delisted from American exchanges in three years. White House officials have debated throwing their support behind the bill, but several officials, including Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Mnuchin, have opposed delisting as a draconian option that could throw American stock markets into turmoil. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDelisting is not on the table,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kudlow told reporters on Monday. He said the administration was responding to complaints to the commission about a lack of transparency and compliance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very early in our deliberations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Elizabeth Economy, the director for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that addressing the lack of compliance among Chinese companies was \u00e2\u0080\u009coverdue\u00e2\u0080\u009d but that a solution would ideally be negotiated between Chinese companies and the S.E.C. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody benefits from a mass delisting of Chinese companies on U.S. stock exchanges,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Economy said.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The last time the United States abandoned allies in the Middle East, military officials say, it helped lead to the Iraq war. Now, almost 30 years later, President Trump has pulled American special forces and support troops away from Kurdish allies in northern Syria, easing the way for Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promised offensive, which began on Wednesday. It is too soon to say with any certainty where Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abandonment of the Kurdish fighters who did the heavy lifting in the fight against the Islamic State will lead. But already, anguished American military and national security officials are sounding alarms that clearing the way for Turkey to bomb the Kurds could have long-term repercussions, just as the desertion of allies did then. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the course of American history, when we have stuck with our allies in troubling circumstances, from the U.K. and Australia under attack in WWII to South Korea in the Korean War, things tend to work out to our benefit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral and former supreme allied commander for Europe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we walk away from loyal allies, as we did in Vietnam and are now threatening to do in Afghanistan and Syria, the wheels come off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the end of the Persian Gulf war, the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 refusal to aid a rebellion it encouraged in Iraq allowed Saddam Hussein to brutally crush the insurgents, leaving him in power and American allies on the ground alienated and slaughtered by the thousands. Now, with the Kurds potentially facing a similar fate, a Pentagon official said anger within the military was deeper than at any other point in Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tenure as commander in chief. That is in part because American military officials personally know the Kurds they have been fighting alongside. They consider them friends and even, in some cases, brothers in arms. While the Kurds may not have been with the Americans in Normandy, as Mr. Trump curiously noted on Wednesday, neither were the American service members who are now in Iraq and Syria. What those service members know, military officials say, is that the Kurds have been with them in Manbij, and Raqqa, and the Middle Euphrates River Valley. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happens if we leave?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the normally reticent Gen. Joseph L. Votel, who until March was the commander of United States Central Command overseeing the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, wrote in an op-ed article in The Atlantic on Tuesday, two days after the White House announced it was leaving the Kurds. In the piece, General Votel spoke fondly of the top Kurdish general, Mazloum Abdi, whom he called \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpressive and thoughtful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d General Votel, now retired, wrote that Turkish attacks on the Kurdish fighters, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoupled with a hasty U.S. departure, now threaten to rapidly destabilize an already fragile security situation in Syria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s northeast, where ISIS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 physical caliphate was only recently defeated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Paul D. Eaton, a retired major general and veteran of the Iraq war, was more blunt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt takes time to build trust,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd any time you erode trust, like this, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that much harder to bring it back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pentagon officials fear that Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incursion could lead to the release of tens of thousands of Islamic State fighters and their families who are being held in detention facilities under Kurdish control, and a return, quickly, of the self-proclaimed caliphate that the United States and its partners have spent the last five years destroying. But even more, they fear that the next time the United States is looking for help from fighters on the ground in the region, the Americans will not be able to find it. This has happened before. In February 1991, as the Desert Storm campaign was unfolding in Iraq, President George Bush, during a rally in Andover, Mass., suggested that the Iraqi people \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake matters into their own hands and force Saddam Hussein, the dictator, to step aside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Two weeks later, Mr. Bush made another call to arms, saying that putting Hussein \u00e2\u0080\u009caside\u00e2\u0080\u009d would \u00e2\u0080\u009cfacilitate the resolution of all these problems that exist and certainly would facilitate the acceptance of Iraq back into the family of peace-loving nations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Iraq\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feared Republican Guard did not heed Mr. Bush. But the Shiites and the Kurds did. On March 1, the day after Mr. Bush halted the Desert Storm war effort, Iraqi Shiites in the south and Kurds in the north began a rebellion against Hussein. At first, things went swiftly and well for the Shiites and the Kurds, as a succession of Iraqi cities and towns \u00e2\u0080\u0094 although not Baghdad \u00e2\u0080\u0094 came under their control. But the United States never stepped in to assist, and Hussein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military soon regrouped and began a counteroffensive. In fact, the cease-fire negotiated by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf to end Desert Storm helped Hussein quell the uprising. The deal prohibited the Iraqi military from using fixed-wing aircraft over the country but allowed helicopters, which Hussein then deployed to bombard the Shiites, who had few surface-to-air missiles or heavy weapons. They were largely defenseless against the helicopters strafing the ground. In the north, Iraqi divisions crushed the Kurdish rebellion. Shiite and Kurdish leaders turned to the Americans, begging for help. It did not come. American warplanes in the south did not engage as the Republican Guard wiped out the rebellious Shiites by the thousands. Human Rights Watch reported that \u00e2\u0080\u009cin their attempts to retake cities, and after consolidating control, loyalist forces killed thousands of unarmed civilians by firing indiscriminately into residential areas\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cexecuting young people on the streets, in homes and in hospitals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Iraqi military, Human Rights Watch said, was shooting people \u00e2\u0080\u009cen masse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Paul D. Wolfowitz, then the under secretary of defense for policy, was \u00e2\u0080\u009cdismayed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say later, by the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unwillingness to support the Shiite uprising, and particularly by the order that American pilots not shoot down Iraqi military helicopters that were strafing the rebels. More than a decade later, President George W. Bush was surrounded by many of the same national security advisers his father had. One in particular, Mr. Wolfowitz, was forcefully making the case that it was time for the United States to do what it did not in 1991: Go after Hussein. When the United States finally did enter Iraq in 2003, the Shiites, while welcoming the toppling of Hussein, did not greet the Americans as liberators.",

      "subtitle": "Jane Sanders, long an influential force in her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political life, has recently been instrumental in shaping decisions about his health issues, his campaign and the flow of information to the public.",
      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": "BURLINGTON, Vt. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 When it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife, Jane Sanders. It was Ms. Sanders who provided a medical update after her husband was hospitalized in Las Vegas last week and had two stents inserted into an artery \u00e2\u0080\u0094 issuing a statement and speaking to reporters outside the hospital. When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who has effectively been running the campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s external communications in Vermont this week \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, \u00e2\u0080\u009cespecially me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d had told him to slow down. Ms. Sanders has played a central role in her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political life for decades, acting as his confidante and his closest adviser. Yet as Mr. Sanders weighs the future of his candidacy, never has it been clearer that the two of them are primarily making the calls for his campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll often say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk to Jane,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Representative Ro Khanna of California, one of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national campaign co-chairs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one person Senator Sanders listens to above everybody else \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by an order of magnitude,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Khanna said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no one whose political judgment he trusts more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be \u00e2\u0080\u009cegotistical\u00e2\u0080\u009d to call herself Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top adviser but allowed that she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery much a close adviser.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Above all, she said, she was \u00e2\u0080\u009chis wife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe share a life, and his life is of public service,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I need to be part of that in order to have a wonderful marriage. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary for us to work together because he works a lot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said in an interview with NBC News Wednesday that he learned he had suffered a heart attack on the night he entered the hospital last week with chest pains. Ms. Sanders, in the interview with The New York Times shortly afterward, said she only learned of it two days later, last Thursday. Ms. Sanders said the decision not to reveal her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart attack until the next day was motivated by another crisis in her family occurring at the same time: the sudden cancer diagnosis of her daughter-in-law, Rain\u00c3\u00a8 Riggs, the wife of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son, Levi Sanders. Ms. Riggs died this weekend, at age 46. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard it on Thursday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Sanders said, referring to her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart attack. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut frankly, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thinking about the campaign.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significant role in her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential run recalls the close involvement of other political spouses, including Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Nancy Reagan. They had other trusted aides, and Ms. Sanders said her husband does too, listing Jeff Weaver, his 2016 campaign manager who has been by his side for decades; Faiz Shakir, his 2020 campaign manager; and Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager. But if most politicians typically rely on their spouses as part of a larger group of consultants and close friends, Mr. Sanders maintains only a small inner circle and has long leaned primarily on his wife, who operates as something of a co-strategist for the Sanders brand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere Jane goes, Bernie goes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael Ceraso, a high-ranking aide on Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 campaign in New Hampshire and California. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is his engine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She is also fiercely protective of her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image. When Mr. Sanders had elective hernia surgery in 2015, for example, her preference was not to tell the media, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversations at the time. But other advisers convinced her and Mr. Sanders that if they did not disclose the operation and it was later revealed, their secrecy would create a firestorm in the press. Much like with his heart attack last month, the campaign initially only released a statement with spare details. The Sanders partnership formed soon after the two met at a political event during his first campaign for mayor in 1981. When he was in City Hall, she ran his youth office. They married in 1988. When Mr. Sanders was elected to Congress in 1990, Jane Sanders served as his unpaid chief of staff, vetting potential staff members and writing dozens of pieces of legislation. She helped him form the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 1991, worked on his re-election ads and liaised with reporters. Those who have worked with Mr. Sanders say his wife has extraordinary influence over his decisions. If they want him to sign off on something, one way to ensure it happens is to get her buy-in first. That level of trust has made her one of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most important assets. During the 2016 campaign, she was credited with helping to humanize her husband, who can come across as gruff and impersonal, offering a tour of their Burlington home and even showing reporters pictures of their wedding day from a photo album. But she has also complicated his presidential bid: A federal investigation into her role in a 2010 land deal as president of a Vermont college threatened to undercut his populist appeal. (Ms. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer said last year that he had been told the investigation had been closed.) She also started a public policy group, the Sanders Institute, that attracted scrutiny because her son served as executive director and drew a salary of $100,000 last year. She suspended its operations in March soon after Mr. Sanders announced his run. And at times, her influence has also frustrated advisers. Some people familiar with the campaign said she would get annoyed when it appeared that decisions were being made without her input, often prompting her to try to reassert control. When Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aides were finalizing plans for the campaign announcement earlier this year, for instance, Ms. Sanders questioned whether it was wise to start the race in Brooklyn: Some observers, she warned, might note that Hillary Clinton had located her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn in 2016. Her concern perplexed some Sanders advisers who wondered why that was relevant, according to one Democratic official familiar with the discussion, making the case that it was important to set the announcement in the city where Mr. Sanders and President Trump both grew up, to draw a contrast between their values. (Mr. Sanders ultimately did kick off his candidacy in Brooklyn, with a big rally that drew thousands of supporters.) Mr. Shakir, the campaign manager, said he never heard Ms. Sanders express any concern about the announcement decision. In another instance, Ms. Sanders was unhappy with one of the commercials Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consulting team devised for his campaign kickoff earlier this year, people familiar with the matter said. Without discussing their plans with the consultants, the Sanderses decided that he would record a different, more unadorned advertisement from a Burlington studio \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and he ultimately shared that version widely with supporters. But the move prompted the advisers, who played a central role in his 2016 bid, to abruptly quit the campaign. People who know her say Ms. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intense involvement stems both from her commitment to changing the world with progressive ideas and from her deep love for her husband. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a critical relationship for both of them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jim Rader, a Sanders confidant who officiated their wedding. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just been a very crucial part of obviously his personal life, but also his professional life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the interview, Ms. Sanders said she was most concerned now about getting Mr. Sanders back in good health, including changing his diet to incorporate more vegetables, especially while on the campaign trail. And though she admitted to being worried after his heart scare, she said it had not prompted them to consider dropping out of the race. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been his entire life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 fighting for the average working people in this country, and this is not the time to stop when it feels like things can really change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it was more serious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure we would have thought about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Each state in America has an official state bird, usually an iconic species that helps define the landscape. Minnesota chose the common loon, whose haunting wails echo across the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s northern lakes each summer. Georgia picked the brown thrasher, a fiercely territorial bird with a repertoire of more than 1,000 song types. But as the planet warms and birds across the country relocate to escape the heat, at least eight states could see their state birds largely or entirely disappear from within their borders during the summer, according to a new study. The research, released Thursday by the National Audubon Society, projects that hundreds of bird species across North America are likely to drastically shift their ranges in the decades ahead in response to rising temperatures and other threats from climate change. The report raises the prospect that many bird species could struggle to cope as warming forces them into unfamiliar territory or shrinks their existing habitats. And it illustrates how thoroughly the avian world as we know it may be remapped if humans continue pumping greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. If global temperatures rise a plausible 3 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels this century, Minnesota will no longer enjoy the local climate conditions that loons are accustomed to as they arrive each summer to breed and hunt for food, the study found. As a result, the birds may bypass the state altogether and head farther north. The same goes for other state birds, including the northern flicker in Alabama \u00e2\u0080\u0094 known locally as the yellowhammer \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0as well as the brown thrasher in Georgia, the purple finch in New Hampshire, the hermit thrush in Vermont and the goldfinch in Iowa and New Jersey. Those birds are projected to lose virtually all of their summer ranges within those states at 3 degrees of global warming. The California quail, often seen strutting around the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suburbs and parks, could lose 87 percent of its winter range in California. And the ruffed grouse, the official state game bird in Pennsylvania and one that is popular with hunters, could lose its entire summer and winter ranges in the state, the study found. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one way we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see the effects of climate change right in our own backyards,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Yarnold, the president of the National Audubon Society. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever been around a lake in the upper United States, you can probably hear the sound of a loon in your head. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to imagine a Minnesota summer without them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to imagine a New Jersey summer without goldfinches.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To conduct the study, Audubon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scientists mapped the current ranges and habitats of 604 bird species across North America, using data from millions of bird observations. They then used climate models to estimate the birds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 future ranges under warming conditions of 1.5 degrees, 2 degrees and 3 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The expectation was that many birds will try to move to keep up with shifts in temperature, rainfall and vegetation. Many species could face major upheaval. The report classified 389 of the species studied as \u00e2\u0080\u009cvulnerable\u00e2\u0080\u009d to 3 degrees Celsius of warming. That means the birds are projected to lose a significant portion of their current range and may have relatively limited opportunities to move elsewhere. Examples include the lark bunting, Colorado\u00e2\u0080\u0099s state bird, and the wood thrush, a migratory bird that breeds in Eastern forests. The report also mapped out which bird species are likely to face additional dangers from climate change, such as increased springtime heat, fiercer wildfires or rising ocean levels. For instance, the piping plover, which builds its nests in sandy areas along the Atlantic coast, is expected to see its habitat encroached by the rising seas. Outside experts who reviewed the study called its methods to project shifting bird ranges and other climate threats reasonable. But they cautioned that it can be extremely difficult to predict how many bird species might be able to adapt to hotter climates and new environments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, conversely, how many birds might face increased extinction risk as a result. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about how certain species might adapt to novel climate conditions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Benjamin Zuckerberg, an associate professor in the Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe might see bird species shifting their nesting times or changing their diet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is a real concern that the rate of climate change is going to be beyond the ability of many species to adapt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Audubon report is a much more detailed update of a study the group published in 2014 on how climate change might disrupt bird populations. And it comes on the heels of a recent paper in the journal Science estimating that the total number of birds in the United States and Canada has declined by 29 percent since 1970, with 2.9 billion fewer birds in the skies today. Much of that decline, experts say, was likely caused by factors such as habitat loss or pesticide use, not climate change. But there are some signs that global warming is now putting additional pressure on birds. In a 2012 study, scientists concluded that climate change had likely contributed to the decline of the once-common rusty blackbird, which has seen its range in Maine retract northward as temperatures have risen. The Audubon study does suggest that there are ways to lessen the pressure on North America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birds. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions would likely help: The study concluded that limiting total global warming to 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees Celsius would significantly reduce the vulnerability of hundreds of species. While the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nations have vowed, under the Paris climate agreement, to curb emissions in order to limit global warming to those lower levels, they are nowhere near on track to do so. Among other things, at the lower end of global warming, many state birds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Minnesota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loon and New Hampshire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purple finch \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would be more likely to maintain at least a fraction of their current range in their states. There are also adaptive measures that could be taken that would protect habitat both for today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birds as well as any species that might migrate into an area in the future. Mr. Yarnold, the president of Audubon, noted that policymakers could protect local wetlands and forests, while local communities could plant more native vegetation in backyards and along highway medians. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe big takeaway is that we can have a huge impact on the future of the planet, and of birds, by changing our emissions trajectory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there are also things that people can do in their own communities, in their own backyards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "KIEV, Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 When two elderly women started shouting at President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday, interrupting questions from journalists about his summer call to President Trump with complaints about a local mayor, the young Ukrainian leader made clear where his priorities lay. Mr. Zelensky, whose political party is called Servant of the People, abandoned the journalists and his exasperated press secretary and went over to hear the women out, ordering his aides to take down their information and determine how to address their concerns. The scene unfolded in the course of a daylong news conference that Mr. Zelensky hosted at a food court in central Kiev, part of an effort to take back control of his narrative and refocus attention on domestic priorities amid the firestorm surrounding his interactions with President Trump. This is not where Mr. Zelensky expected to be when he took office last May. A popular comedian and actor, who played a president on TV before he entered the race for Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actual presidency last year, Mr. Zelenksy had anticipated becoming embroiled in ferocious battles with Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oligarchs over endemic corruption and going head-to-head with Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president, Vladimir V. Putin. In the past, America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support as he faced down these challenges and attempted to break Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cycle of instability and dysfunction would have been a given. No more. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRight now, I am in the center of world media,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at the news conference. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI really wanted to be world famous, but not because of such a situation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With locals milling about on their lunch hours, Mr. Zelensky spent the day on Thursday holding court in front of a barbecue restaurant, hosting a rotating series of small panels with local and foreign journalists. He tried to focus the conversation on the bread and butter issues that both he and most Ukrainians say they elected him to address: rampant corruption, crumbling infrastructure and a war against Russian-backed separatists that continues to bleed the country of lives and treasure. The war has cost 13,000 lives, led to the loss of the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed in 2014. Large swathes of eastern Ukraine are under control of separatists backed by Russia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat kind of president did society elect?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Zelensky said to journalists on Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA president that will end the war. This is my mission for the next five years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He fielded questions about organized crime in the city of Odessa and the continued presence in his government of high-ranking officials who have long been stained by corruption. And he was asked repeatedly about Ihor Kolomoisky, a billionaire and former business partner of Mr. Zelensky, whose looming influence over his administration is at odds with his promises to finally expel the oligarchs from power. All the while, members of the public meandered around just a few yards away, buying muffins and occasionally yelling out questions or complaints of their own. The event had the appearance of Mr. Zelenky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite medium: theater. \u00e2\u0080\u009dZelensky won the election on the message that, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not a typical politician \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I am the anti-politician, I am the man of the people,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Volodymyr Yermolenko, editor in chief of Ukraine World, said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTherefore, he should communicate with media without symbols of power. That was the idea behind the whole theater.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But time and again, journalists steered him back to Mr. Trump and Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in an impeachment inquiry that has threatened to engulf not one but two presidencies. As Mr. Trump fights for his political life and legacy in the United States, Mr. Zelenksy has had to contend with the fallout in Ukraine and his place at the center of an enormous political scandal raging thousands of miles away. So far, he has handled the challenge with poise, observers say, and a little bit of the wry sass that made him famous in his home country. After a partial transcript of his call with Mr. Trump was released, showcasing his somewhat awkward efforts to make nice to President Trump, he joked that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the White House would publish his part of the conversation. And with American TV networks clamoring for an on-camera exclusive with the man at the center of the drama, Mr. Zelensky chose instead to sit for an interview with Kyodo, a Japanese news service. It is difficult to gauge fully how the impeachment inquiry in the United States has affected Mr. Zelenksy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standing with Ukrainians, though a poll published this week by the National Democratic Institute found that 67 percent of respondents trust or fully trust the president. For many, the drama in faraway Washington can feel remote next to more pressing local questions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t something that we really talk about in Ukraine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Valeria A. Gontareva, the former head of Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Central Bank. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had 20 banks involved in money laundering that we closed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet them investigate that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Zelensky has received far more scrutiny over his handling of the conflict with Russia than anything involving Mr. Trump. Last weekend, thousands of Ukrainians gathered in central Kiev to protest after Mr. Zelensky signed onto a proposal to grant a degree of autonomy to separatist regions as long as they hold elections deemed free and fair by international observers. Critics have derided the move as capitulation to Russia because the deal includes no timeline for a pullback of Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forces. Mr. Zelensky is also pursuing a policy of disengagement along the front with Russia by moving Ukrainian front-line trenches back several thousand yards, intended to decrease casualties from snipers and skirmishes and reduce danger to civilians in these areas. Critics accuse the president of giving up territory hard-won by Ukrainian. Konstiantyn Marchenko, 46, a veteran who turned up at the protest against Mr. Zelensky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peace plan last Saturday, called the him a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctraitor and a puppet\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not for obsequiousness to Mr. Trump, but to Mr. Putin. Of course, fallout from the impeachment proceeding in the United States will continue to cast a shadow over Mr. Zelensky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidency. Pressed on the issue on Thursday, Mr. Zelensky again denied he had felt any pressure from Mr. Trump to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, and said he \u00e2\u0080\u009cdidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care what happens\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the case of Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company that once employed Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son. In the phone call, President Trump had asked Mr. Zelensky to do him a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfavor\u00e2\u0080\u009d and investigate the debunked theory that Mr. Biden had directed Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who had set his sights on the company. Mr. Zelensky also insisted that Mr. Trump did not seek to blackmail him over military aid, saying he was not aware at the time of the call that Mr. Trump had put a hold on nearly  $400 million meant to bolster Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fighting ability, and that the topic had not come up. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to delay the release of the military aid is one of the central questions in the impeachment inquiry being pursued by Democrats in the House of Representatives. At issue is whether Mr. Trump sought to use the assistance as leverage to pressure Mr. Zelensky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new government to open investigations into Mr. Biden, one of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading opponents in the 2020 elections. If that was the intended message, Mr. Zelensky does not seem to have received it. The Ukrainian president said that after he became aware of the issue, he raised it, first with Vice President Mike Pence at a meeting in Poland, and then with Mr. Trump directly during a meeting at the United Nations in September. Pressed on the now debunked conspiracy theory promoted by some of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters that it was Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and not Russia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that was guilty of interfering in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Zelenksy said that he had no intention of meddling in any country. He warned other countries to stay out of Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal affairs as well. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou chose your president yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in response to a question from an American journalist. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, if I may say so, you will not now, or in the future, influence the elections of an independent Ukraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "LONDON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump offered little succor to the authorities in Britain on Wednesday in a growing dispute over an American woman who fled the country using diplomatic immunity after being involved in a road crash that left a teenage motorcyclist dead. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain had said that he would appeal directly to the president for the return of the woman, Anne Sacoolas, a diplomat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife. The police in Northamptonshire, England, suspect her of being the driver of a car that they say was on the wrong side of the road when it collided with a motorcycle ridden by Harry Dunn, 19. When Mr. Johnson raised the case in a phone call on Wednesday, according to a statement from the prime minister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, Mr. Trump expressed his condolences to Mr. Dunn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family and \u00e2\u0080\u009cagreed to work together to find a way forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the statement made no mention of withdrawing diplomatic immunity or any other specific remedy. The case has created diplomatic and political complications for Mr. Johnson, who needs good relations with Mr. Trump to try to secure a trade deal from the United States after Britain leaves the European Union. The reaction to the accident among the British public and media left the prime minister with no choice but to intercede and raise the issue with the president, who is not a popular figure in Britain. The opposition Labour Party argues that Mr. Johnson is planning to sell out British interests through a trade deal with the United States, and sees political mileage in suggesting that he is too close to Mr. Trump. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Trump described the death as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca terrible accident,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding that \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is a very, very complex issue because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about diplomatic immunity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he also expressed understanding for Ms. Sacoolas, suggesting that he had himself driven on the wrong side of the road in Britain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know those are the opposite roads, that happens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say it ever happened to me, but it did. When you get used to driving on our system, and then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all of a sudden on the other system when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re driving, it happens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to speak to her and see what we can come up with so that there can be some healing. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tremendous anger over it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand the anger from the other side very much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The crash occurred on Aug. 27 in Brackley, a town in Northamptonshire about 60 miles northwest of London and near a Royal Air Force base that hosts a United States Air Force communication station. The police have said that Ms. Sacoolas told them before her departure that she had no plans to travel. The two countries have been involved in a diplomatic tug-of-war over the case ever since. Britain transmitted a formal request for a waiver of immunity to the United States Embassy in London on Sept. 5. It was declined eight days later. Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, Harry Dunn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents, have made a public appeal of their own to Mr. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Trump, please listen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Charles told Sky News, the outlet that first publicly identified Ms. Sacoolas, last week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a family in ruin. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re broken.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grieve,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, adding of the woman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease, please let her get back on a plane.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dominic Raab, the British foreign secretary, has also urged the American Embassy to reconsider their stance. Mr. Raab met with Harry Dunn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family on Wednesday, but they were left disappointed by the meeting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really see the point as to why we were invited to go and see Dominic Raab,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Charles told Sky News after the meeting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPart of me is feeling like it was just a publicity stunt on the U.K. government side to show that they are trying to help,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, adding that, despite spending half an hour or more with Mr. Raab, they had gotten no answers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have come out with nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "Katie Benner, who covers the Justice Department for us, said federal prosecutors probably had the indictment ready to go for a while and were keeping tabs on Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. When the two got one-way tickets out of the country, she said, the prosecutors realized that they had to move. My colleague Mike Schmidt got an eyewitness account of the arrests in the Lufthansa lounge in the B concourse of Dulles International Airport on Wednesday. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what he heard: At first glance, the two men might seem peripheral to the events that the House is investigating. But they were involved in the Ukraine affair from the beginning, dating to Mr. Parnas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job as Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fixer in Ukraine. This evening I stopped by the desk of my colleague Ken Vogel, who revealed Mr. Parnas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement in Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ukraine efforts, to get a sense of why they matter to the impeachment investigation. Why are these two men so important to understanding the whole Ukraine scandal? They were Rudy Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enablers and facilitators in his Ukrainian expedition. They connected Mr. Giuliani to the Ukrainian prosecutors who provided both the information and the potential investigations that are at the center of President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in Ukraine. They were at the very front of all of this activity that led to what became the whistle-blower complaint. Why did that activity raise alarm bells? Their ability to get Congressman Sessions to take up their cause on such a niche issue that might not have been on his radar \u00e2\u0080\u0094 helping to oust the American ambassador to Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is precisely the type of thing that campaign finance watchdogs warn of when they bemoan the power of money of politics. How valuable can they be to federal prosecutors, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve clearly been investigating them long before the impeachment investigation? It depends who the prosecutors are after. The two men could certainly flip and provide plenty of information about Rudy Giuliani. I have a source who saw Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and Mr. Giuliani together not infrequently at the Trump hotel here in Washington. What about to Congress? They were supposed to be important witnesses in the impeachment investigation this week before they were arrested. They could be very useful to Congress, but maybe not as much in the impeachment inquiry. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a ton of access or visibility into Trump himself, so it could be a bit of a bank shot. But in another way, they could be extremely useful. Congress has shown a great interest in the outsourcing of foreign policy, and these guys are right in the middle of that. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump will hold a campaign rally in Minneapolis, his first since the impeachment investigation began. On Friday, House investigators are due to interview  the career diplomat and former American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, whose ouster was sought by Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and many in the Trump administration. Despite the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to block cooperation by State Department employees, Ms. Yovanovitch has signaled to House staff members that she is willing to speak to them.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Federal prosecutors unsealed charges on Thursday against two men who have aided President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to gather damaging information in Ukraine about his political opponents, a criminal case that signaled growing legal exposure for the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies as Mr. Trump tries to blunt an impeachment inquiry in Congress. The indictment of the two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, sketched a complex scheme to violate campaign finance laws and did not accuse Mr. Trump of wrongdoing. But it revealed new details about the push to pressure Ukraine: a campaign encouraged by Mr. Trump, led by his private lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and assisted by obscure figures like Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. Mr. Trump continues to defend the effort, which is the focus of the impeachment inquiry that House Democrats opened last month. The new indictment, however, suggests the first criminal implications of the shadow foreign policy that Mr. Giuliani pushed on behalf of the president. And it is another example of the extent to which the messy power dynamics of Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a former Soviet republic and close American ally with a recent history of political upheaval \u00e2\u0080\u0094 now dominate discussions about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future. The impeachment inquiry began after a C.I.A. officer who has worked at the White House raised alarms about a July telephone call in which Mr. Trump seemed to suggest that American military aid was contingent on Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help in unearthing information that could help Mr. Trump politically. [Rudy Giuliani was a zero-tolerance mayor who cleaned up New York as he inflamed racial tensions. He was hailed as \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mayor\u00e2\u0080\u009d after 9/11. Now, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the center of the Trump impeachment inquiry. Watch \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Weekly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d our new TV show, on FX Sunday at 10/9c.] Mr. Giuliani has been public about his hunt for damaging information about Democrats, and the indictment gives a more complete picture about how he seems to have subcontracted part of the work to Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, two of his longtime associates. It directly connected the two men to a key element of the pressure campaign, an effort to recall the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, after she became a focus of criticism from many of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman donated money and pledged to raise additional funds in 2018 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some violating legal limits \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for a congressman who was then enlisted in the campaign to oust her, court papers showed. Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that the two men were charged with making illegal campaign donations, and law enforcement officials harshly criticized the scheme. On Thursday, William F. Sweeney Jr., the top agent in the F.B.I.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s New York office, said during a news conference that \u00e2\u0080\u009ccampaign finance laws exist for a reason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe American people expect and deserve an election process that hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been corrupted by the influence of foreign interests,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the public has a right to know the true source of campaign contributions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cLaws make up the fabric of who we are as a nation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sweeney added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese allegations aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about some technicality, a civil violation or an error on a form. This investigation is about corrupt behavior and deliberate lawbreaking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The lawmaker is named in the indictment only as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongressman-1,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but campaign finance filings identify him as former Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas. Mr. Sessions, then the chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, wrote a letter in 2018 to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying that Ms. Yovanovitch should be fired for privately expressing \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisdain\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the current administration. Mr. Sessions, who lost his re-election bid last year, said in a statement that he could not confirm that he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongressman-1\u00e2\u0080\u009d but that he would \u00e2\u0080\u009cvigorously defend myself against any allegations of wrongdoing\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by prosecutors. He said that he met the two men to discuss Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bid for energy independence and that he wrote to Mr. Pompeo \u00e2\u0080\u009cseparately, after several congressional colleagues reported to me that the current U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was disparaging President Trump to others as part of those official duties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some Trump allies believed Ms. Yovanovitch was trying to impede their effort to dig up damaging information about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, a former Ukrainian official has said, and House Democrats are looking into whether her removal was linked to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to gain politically helpful information. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman are witnesses in their impeachment inquiry, and Mr. Parnas had been scheduled to be questioned Thursday by investigators. Ms. Yovanovitch was herself scheduled to appear Friday on Capitol Hill, but she remains an employee of the State Department and the Trump administration could try to block her testimony. If that happens, House Democrats have said that they are prepared to subpoena her. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were arrested on Wednesday evening at Dulles International Airport as they held one-way tickets on a Lufthansa Airlines flight to Frankfurt. They were walking down a glass-framed jetway, boarding with first-class passengers after indulging in free drinks and food in the lounge, when two plainclothes officers stopped them, according to someone who witnessed the arrest. After they produced their passports to one of the officers, according to the witness, they were instructed to turn around and walk back toward the terminal, where a phalanx of uniformed and plainclothes officers waited. At a hearing on Thursday in federal court in Northern Virginia, prosecutors argued that the men were flight risks, and a judge set bail at $1 million each. Dressed in T-shirts, Mr. Fruman and Mr. Parnas were represented by two lawyers who defended Paul Manafort, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former campaign chairman who was convicted last year in the same courthouse of financial crimes associated with his own work in Ukraine. A lawyer for the men, John M. Dowd, who was not at the hearing, declined to comment. His clients were ordered to appear in court on Thursday in New York, where the charges were filed. The work the two men did in Ukraine for Mr. Giuliani seems to have been a mixture of business and politics. Mr. Parnas advised Mr. Giuliani on energy deals in the region and pursued his own in Ukraine even as he portrayed himself as a representative of Mr. Giuliani on the Trump-related matters. The indictment said Mr. Parnas acted \u00e2\u0080\u009cat least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.\u00e2\u0080\u009d None were named, but Ms. Yovanovitch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main critic in the Ukrainian government was Yuriy Lutsenko, then the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prosecutor general who himself has a history of wielding the law as a weapon in his personal political battles. Both Mr. Fruman and Mr. Parnas appear to have at least glancing contacts with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump invited Mr. Fruman to a fund-raiser last year at the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, he said in an interview with Forum Daily, a publication that bills itself as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cvoice of Russian-speaking America.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The article featured a photograph of the two men, with the president giving a thumbs-up sign. Mr. Parnas posted a photo on Twitter this spring of himself with the president and wished Mr. Trump a happy birthday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am honored to call you Mr. President!!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd my friend!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president sought to distance himself from the men as he left the White House on Thursday en route to a political rally in Minnesota. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know those gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about them. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what they do. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, maybe they were clients of Rudy. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to ask Rudy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Giuliani said that no one from the Justice Department had contacted him about Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have to presume they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re innocent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNone of those facts that I see there make any sense to me, so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what they mean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said that he was aware they were leaving the country, but he dismissed the idea that they were fleeing and said they regularly traveled to Europe on business. Based in South Florida, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman are executives of an energy company that donated $325,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC last year, which prompted a Federal Election Commission complaint by a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog accusing the men and the company of violating campaign finance laws. Not long before the large donation, the men created a limited liability company called Global Energy Products, which they used to funnel large contributions, according to the indictment. Last month, Mr. Giuliani sought to minimize the significance of the campaign finance inquiry into the two men and said it was resolved. And on Thursday, he questioned the timing of the indictment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll I can tell you about this arrest is, it comes at a very suspicious time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Prosecutors said Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, along with two other men indicted on Thursday, David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, also funneled money to state and federal candidates in exchange for potential influence, according to court papers. The men wanted to set up recreational marijuana businesses in Nevada and other states, and were seeking political help to get access to the necessary licenses. The plot was funded by someone identified only as \u00e2\u0080\u009cForeign National-1\u00e2\u0080\u009d who had \u00e2\u0080\u009cRussian roots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d court papers showed. The arrangement involved an attempt to seek licenses to sell legal marijuana in Nevada, but the defendants missed a deadline to apply for them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo months too late to the game unless we change the rules,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kukushkin told the unidentified foreign citizen, according to the indictment. Mr. Correia was still at large but was expected to turn himself in, according to a law enforcement official. Mr. Kukushkin appeared briefly in federal court in San Francisco, where the government argued that he was a flight risk who should not be granted bail, citing his connections to overseas wealth, his multiple properties in the Bay Area and his refusal to turn over his Ukrainian passport. He was to appear again on Friday in court to discuss bail. His lawyer, Alan Dressler, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "subtitle": "null",
      "author": "Coral Davenport",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The Trump administration on Thursday proposed new regulations on lead and copper in drinking water, updating a nearly 30-year-old rule that may have contributed to the lead-tainted water crisis in Flint, Mich., that began in 2015. The draft plan, announced by the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Andrew Wheeler, at a news conference in Green Bay, Wis., includes some provisions designed to strengthen oversight of lead in drinking water. But it skips a pricey safety proposal advocated by public health groups and water utilities: the immediate replacement of six million lead pipes that connect homes to main water pipes. The proposed new rule would also more than double the amount of time allotted to replace lead pipes in water systems that contain high levels of lead. Mr. Wheeler framed the new regulations as a major step forward in protecting water supplies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe water sector has known for years and years that the regulations governing lead and copper in our water need to be improved, but administration after administration has failed to get it done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Wheeler said, noting that the standards were last updated in 1991. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are delivering on the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment that all Americans have access to clean and safe drinking water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although the new proposal would extend the timetable for replacing lead pipes, it would include new requirements that schools and day care centers be tested for lead, and, if elevated lead levels are found, customers would have to be told within 24 hours, not the current standard of 30 days. It would also require water utilities to conduct inventories of their lead service pipes and publicly report their locations. Environmental activists said those moves forward would not make up for the relaxation of standards in other areas. The slower timetable for the replacement of lead pipes is a \u00e2\u0080\u009chuge weakening change that will swallow up the few small improvements in the proposal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Erik D. Olson, an expert in drinking water policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group, in an email. The new rule proposes changing a key element of the current rules, which requires that a water system that is found to contain lead levels higher than 15 parts per billion must replace 7 percent of its lead service lines each year for as long as the lead levels exceed that measurement. The new proposal would instead require water systems with those lead levels to replace 3 percent of lead service lines each year. Mr. Olson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s group estimated that the loosening of standards could extend the length of time needed to replace dangerous lead water pipes from 13 years to 33 years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt means that another generation of American kids will be exposed to dangerous levels of lead from their drinking water,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. President Trump has made the rollback of environmental regulations a hallmark of his administration, with initiatives to weaken or erase dozens of E.P.A. regulations on climate change, chemical pollution and water quality. At the same time, he has also called attention to the concerns about lead in water that were ignited by the discovery of high levels of lead and other contaminants that poisoned Flint\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drinking water for more than a year. He also frequently emphasizes his desire to promote \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrystal-clear water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During a 2016 campaign stop in Flint, Mr. Trump said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt used to be, cars were made in Flint and you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you cannot drink the water in Flint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow it to happen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, announced that he would prioritize removing lead from water, saying that the agency was declaring \u00e2\u0080\u009cwar on lead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Pruitt stepped down amid a corruption scandal in 2017. A 2018 report from the E.P.A.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office of Inspector General said management weaknesses had hobbled the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response to the Flint crisis and that federal officials should have taken stronger action to correct repeated blunders by state regulators. Mr. Pruitt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s successor, Mr. Wheeler, announcing the plan, highlighted it as part of Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health Month, which falls in October. But for Flint advocates, it fell well short. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need urgent action and bold investments to rebuild America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water infrastructure, not weakened policies that fail to protect the health and safety of our citizens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Representative Dan Kildee, Democrat of Michigan, who was born and raised in Flint and represents it in Congress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Flint water crisis should have taught policymakers at all levels of government that we must get serious about removing lead from our water systems. Yet the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies have continuously put special corporate interests ahead of public health.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The draft plan will be open for public comment for 60 days, and Mr. Wheeler said that he expected to complete the final plan next summer.",

      "content": "President Trump announced on Thursday that United States forces had killed Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, a highly skilled Qaeda bomb maker who built the explosives for several high-profile terrorist plots. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement belatedly confirmed news reports from August 2018 that cited United States officials expressing confidence that Mr. Asiri, a leader of the Yemen-based branch known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, had likely been killed by a drone strike in the country the year before. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will confirm for the first time that Ibrahim al-Asiri, a senior al Qaeda bomb maker and terrorist coordinator, was killed two years ago in a United States counterterrorism operation in Yemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said in the statement released by the White House. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe United States will continue to hunt down terrorists like al-Asiri until they no longer pose a threat to our great nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The statement did not explain the reason for the long delay. The United States is not always sure who exactly has been killed in counterterrorism operations conducted from a distance, including by a drone strike, and confirmation can sometimes come later through new intelligence such as intercepted conversations or interrogations. The announcement also comes as Mr. Trump faces intense criticism from national security experts, many of them Republicans, over his failure to prevent Turkey from invading northeastern Syria to attack Syrian Kurdish fighters. Those Kurdish fighters have been the major ground ally in Syria for the campaign against the Islamic State. Many military and intelligence officials believe the Turkish action could make it easier for the Islamic State, or ISIS, to regenerate as the Kurds turn their attention toward their Turkish enemies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is important, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not news,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Joshua A. Geltzer, who served as a senior director for counterterrorism on the National Security Council in the Obama administration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCredible reports have been indicating Asiri is dead for over a year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Geltzer added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo this announcement appears deliberately designed to portray Trump as tough on terrorism in a week when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proving the opposite \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abandoning key U.S. partners in the fight against ISIS and thus directly raising the terrorist threat to Americans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Writing in The Washington Post soon after reports of Mr. Asiri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death last year, the former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Michael J. Morell, said that, if confirmed, \u00e2\u0080\u009che would be the most significant international terrorist removed from the battlefield since Osama bin Laden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was well known as a master of his craft, and was as intelligent as he was evil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Morrell wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I left government in 2013, I considered him the most dangerous terrorist on the planet. His removal leaves the world a safer place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Though many of his plots failed, Mr. Asiri was among the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most feared terrorist operatives for much of the past decade. Technically skilled and imaginative about evading bomb-detection technology, he was long the target of an intensive manhunt by American military and intelligence officials. It was Mr. Asiri who sewed a bomb into the underpants of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to detonate the device on an American airliner approaching Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009. The bomb fizzled harmlessly and Mr. Abdulmutallab was arrested and imprisoned. Mr. Asiri also designed explosive devices disguised as printer cartridges and intended to blow up cargo planes over the United States in 2010, and another device meant to bring down a passenger plane in 2012, according to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement. But perhaps the most novel \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and disturbing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of Mr. Asiri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plots involved the recruitment of his own brother to become a suicide bomber in a 2009 plan to assassinate Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crown prince at the time, Mohammed bin Nayef. The younger Mr. Asiri hid in his rectum a one-pound explosive device fashioned by his brother and which was remotely detonated during a meeting with Mr. Nayef, who survived. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough the assassination attempt failed, the brutality, novelty and sophistication of the plot is illustrative of the threat posed by al-Asiri,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said in his statement.",

      "author": "Tariro Mzezewa",
      "content": "When Jacqueline Kennedy and her younger sister, Lee Radziwill, began a tour of India and Pakistan in March 1962, the first lady was described in Life magazine as \u00e2\u0080\u009carguably the most famous woman in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In India, crowds gathered to see Mrs. Kennedy in Jaipur, New Delhi and Fatehpur Sikri. In Pakistan, she was welcomed by people lining the streets of Lahore, Karachi  and the Khyber Pass. The sisters spent two weeks in the countries, and were photographed riding camels and elephants, on a boat ride along the Ganges, at a horse and cattle show and at black-tie dinners with politicians, diplomats and other dignitaries. Beginning on Friday, Mrs. Radziwill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal photo albums of the trip will be on display at Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s New York, a week ahead of an auction of jewelry, fine art, books, decorative arts and other memorabilia (including the albums) from her home in New York City. Mrs. Radziwill died of natural causes in her home on Feb. 16. She was 85. Mrs. Radziwill became a princess when she married a Polish \u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9 nobleman, Prince Stanislas Radziwill in 1959. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting to see how Princess Radziwill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way of life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the way in which she lived, the interiors of the apartments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 reflected her travels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jonathan Rendell, a deputy chairman at Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who is working on the auction. Despite having a complicated relationship, the sisters often traveled together; they even wrote a book about their first trip to Europe. The fact that the first lady brought her sister on the trip to India and Pakistan signaled that they were on good terms. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was no need for Mrs. Kennedy to take her sister, but she wanted to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rendell said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can see that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re enjoying being in each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d India and Pakistan had been divided for 15 years when the women arrived. The Sino Indian War would begin later that year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe moment of the sisters going there is very pivotal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a slow moving timebomb between the struggle of Kashmir, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening with India and China, and Pakistan and Afghanistan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Manan Ahmed, a historian at Columbia University. On March 12, after taking a chartered Air India flight from Rome, the sisters arrived to a red carpet rolled out on the runway at Palam Airport in New Delhi. They were accompanied by John Kenneth Galbraith, the United States ambassador to India, and his wife, Kitty. The sisters were greeted by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. In a blue album with a golden inscription \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cVisit of Mrs. John F. Kennedy to India (March 1962)\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are color and monochrome photos of Mrs. Kennedy alone in front of the Taj Mahal in a green dress and white gloves, and of both sisters at a black-tie dinner attended by Braj Kumar Nehru, the Indian Ambassador to the United States, along with Mr. Nehru and his daughter. The album has 89 photographs. In the 1960s, Mr. Rendell said, first ladies did not typically play roles in American relations elsewhere in the world. Mrs. Radziwill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photographs, however, show Mrs. Kennedy and her sister with Prime Minister Nehru and others in semi-official situations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis type of diplomacy has almost disappeared,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pity, because they projected a certain version of American culture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After eight days in India, Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Radziwill made their way to Pakistan, where they were welcomed by crowds with flowers and gifts. Clint Hill, a Secret Service agent on the trip, later told Radio Free Europe that a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhole damn bouquet\u00e2\u0080\u009d of flowers would occasionally be flung at Mrs. Kennedy as she was driven through the streets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to rise out of my seat to fend it off so it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t knock her in the head,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. A green album inscribed \u00e2\u0080\u009cVisit to Pakistan, March 21-26, 1962\u00e2\u0080\u009d shows the women with President Mohammad Ayub Khan (above). The women also met with a camel driver, Bashir Ahmad, and his family at the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s residence in Karachi. They rode one of his camels through the grounds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese photographs are a little slice of Americana that has gone completely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rendell said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey look so happy, and you know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and you know you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump and his allies have struggled for months to come up with effective ways to confront Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose steady rise in the polls put the lie to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boasts last spring that she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinished\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cgone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d undone by her past claims of Native American ancestry. Republicans have tried to brand her as a socialist, attack her policy ideas and portray her as too left-wing for the American electorate. None of those arguments have diminished her political momentum, robust fund-raising or polling. But in the past week, conservative news sites have challenged Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story about how a public school principal forced her out of a teaching job in 1971 because she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cvisibly pregnant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the Republican National Committee grabbed onto the issue to wage its own attack. In doing so, Republicans employed a tactic \u00e2\u0080\u0094 questioning a female candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authenticity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is at once often a sexist trope in politics and a strategy used against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Ms. Warren and her team, in turn, have confidently parried those attacks and used them to rally supporters. Rather than take a defensive posture, Ms. Warren has responded by offering her personal story as one of countless instances of pregnancy discrimination that have occurred in American workplaces, where it remains a widespread problem. In a video that has been viewed more than a million times across social media platforms, Ms. Warren read messages from women sharing their own experiences. Christina Reynolds, who was an aide on Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign and is now a spokeswoman for EMILY\u00e2\u0080\u0099s List, which supports female Democratic candidates who back abortion rights, said the Warren campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move to solicit stories from people was a better response to the line of attack \u00e2\u0080\u009cthan just saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not true.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really powerful thing that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich is turn this into a learning opportunity for all of us as to what women have faced at past times, what they might still face and how can we do better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Well before Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story about losing her teaching job became the subject of news articles, she was being challenged over how she has presented her biography. Since she first ran for the Senate in 2012, she has faced questions over having identified herself as Native American during her career as a law professor, and she drew a backlash last year when she released a DNA test offering evidence that she had a Native American ancestor. Ms. Warren later apologized in private and in public. An email from the Republican National Committee on Tuesday offered a clear preview of how the party would seek to undermine her if she becomes the Democratic nominee: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just her heritage Fauxcahontas has been lying about to get ahead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the subject line said. A spokeswoman for the committee, Liz Harrington, said on Wednesday, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike her false claim of Native American status, this is another example of Warren seemingly shifting the facts of her life story for personal gain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Ms. Warren has said she did not advance her career by identifying herself as Native American, an assertion backed up by an extensive Boston Globe investigation.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more examples like this that surface, the more it will stick with voters that this is someone who cannot be trusted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Harrington said. Mr. Trump has slurred Ms. Warren for years over her ancestry claims, and the personal attacks on her come out of the Trump playbook from 2016 that targeted both Republicans and Mrs. Clinton. Michael Steel, a Republican strategist who was an adviser for former Gov. Jeb Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 presidential campaign, said Mr. Trump would need to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctear down\u00e2\u0080\u009d whoever is the eventual Democratic nominee in order to win re-election, given his low approval ratings. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of Senator Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great strengths is her ability to connect her biography to her record to her plans for the future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat gets undermined if she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rely on her biography as the foundation of that progression.\u00e2\u0080\u009d All year, Ms. Warren has framed her personal story to voters as one of perseverance, focusing on her upbringing in Oklahoma, her family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial struggles and her winding path to an eventual career as a law professor. Voters often praise her biographical story as a powerful part of her pitch, which centers on bringing about big change to an economic and political system that she describes as rigged against ordinary people. As part of that story, Ms. Warren tells crowds that at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cvisibly pregnant\u00e2\u0080\u009d and lost her job.  A retired teacher from Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school in New Jersey told CBS News, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Teachers in the United States were commonly pushed out of their jobs during pregnancy at the time, either through termination or the requirement of an unpaid leave of absence. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, which barred employers from treating pregnant women differently from other people \u00e2\u0080\u009csimilar in their ability or inability to work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but claims of discrimination persist to this day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese attacks on Senator Warren are absurd,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who dropped out of the presidential race in August. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course pregnancy discrimination was a serious problem in 1971, and it continues to be a widespread issue today despite a law banning it. The stories that women are sharing are real and powerful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Regardless, the Republican National Committee dismissed Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s description of losing her job, citing a 2007 interview in which she discussed her public-school teaching career but did not mention being forced out, as well as records showing that the school board had approved a contract for Ms. Warren for the next school year. The records were reported on Monday by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnother Elizabeth Warren lie about Elizabeth Warren?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Kellyanne Conway, a top aide to Mr. Trump, as she shared The Free Beacon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s article on Twitter. Ms. Warren told CBS News that she had not revealed her pregnancy when the contract was approved, and that two months later, when she was showing, the principal told her that she would not be welcomed back. Addressing the 2007 interview, she said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life and this was one of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The attacks are the latest evidence of how Republicans are reviving tactics Mr. Trump used to caricature Mrs. Clinton, whom he branded as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCrooked Hillary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as dishonest. Attacking authenticity has been a common strategy targeting women running for office for decades: Long before Mrs. Clinton, Geraldine Ferraro faced it in 1984, when she was the first woman to appear on a major party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential ticket. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a tried and true tactic when it comes to women candidates and elected officials, because women pay a much higher price when their honesty and integrity is called into question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Amanda Hunter, research and communications director at the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which supports women in politics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur research shows that voters historically give women what we call a virtue advantage, but then the other side of that is they punish them for any real or manufactured ethical infraction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd once women are knocked off that pedestal, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more difficult for them to climb all the way back up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said the broadsides against Ms. Warren reflected her increasing status as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to come for her in every possible way that they can, and her honesty and truthfulness will be one tactic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe certainly saw this as a tactic when Hillary Clinton was running, to constantly question her veracity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Walsh said she thought Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story of experiencing pregnancy discrimination would \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake her relatable for an awful lot of women out there who understand that this has been how the world works.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign demonstrated readiness for the attacks as news outlets began publishing articles in recent days about her public-school teaching career and pregnancy. Ms. Warren spoke with CBS News to go into greater detail about her story, and she and her campaign sought to shift the focus onto the broader issue of pregnancy discrimination. Her admirers praised her on social media and others offered support, including some rivals in the 2020 race, a sign of the protectiveness that many Democrats feel toward their candidates in the face of Republican attacks. Jennifer Palmieri, who was the communications director for Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 campaign, noted the extent of that unity around Ms. Warren. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis could have been something that really got pounced on by her opponents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "President Trump drew an odd historical parallel this week as he defended his decision to pull American support from allied Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, leaving them vulnerable to a Turkish offensive that began on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fighting for their land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said of the Kurds on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd as somebody wrote in a very, very powerful article today, they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help us in the Second World War. They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help us with Normandy, as an example.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His words came as Turkey began an air and ground offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria. So far, more than a dozen Kurdish fighters have been reported killed. [Read updates on the Turkish offensive, and background on why Turkey is fighting the Kurds there.] After the White House announced on Sunday that American troops would not defend Kurdish fighters in northern Syria from a Turkish military operation, Mr. Trump faced strident criticism \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including from his Republican allies in Congress and United States military leaders. The Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led militia in northeastern Syria, have been a crucial ally to the United States in the fight against the Islamic State, or ISIS. Mr. Trump was discussing the issue in front of reporters on Wednesday when he invoked World War II history. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about why Normandy came up, or which article the president was referring to. But one possibility made the rounds on social media by Wednesday evening: a Tuesday opinion piece by Kurt Schlichter, a conservative writer and commentator. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Kurds helped destroy ISIS, true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Schlichter wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also true that the Kurds would have fought ISIS anyway, since the psycho caliphate was right next door,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s be honest \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Kurds didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up for us at Normandy or Inchon or Khe Sanh or Kandahar. The Syrian Kurds allied with us in their homeland because we shared a common interest in wiping out the head-lopping freak show that was ISIS.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is unclear whether any Kurds were at the Normandy landings, but there is evidence that some of them fought on the side of the Allied forces during World War II. Some background: The Kurds, despite being the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East, are a stateless and often marginalized people whose homeland stretches across Turkey, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Armenia. After World War I, the Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 negotiations with representatives of the defeated Ottoman Empire initially involved provisions for an autonomous Kurdistan. But that was abandoned by the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. Multiple attempts at greater autonomy or nationhood since then have been suppressed or quashed. Some of the Kurds who had been pushed out of the Ottoman Empire and Turkey landed in the Soviet Union, said Mutlu Civiroglu, a Kurdish affairs analyst in Washington. So when World War II began, many fought with the Soviets on the side of the Allies. But they were difficult to track because they did not fight under a Kurdish flag. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Civiroglu said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a navy. They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything on their own. But individually, many people came forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Evidence of this has survived in folk songs and books that pay tribute to Kurds who fought in World War II, Mr. Civiroglu said. He also noted that Samand Aliyevich Siabandov \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a member of the Yazidis, a Kurdish-speaking religious minority \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was a well-known Soviet fighter who was lauded in the English-language Russian newspaper Moscow News in 1946. Supporters of the president seemed to avoid wading into his statement about Kurds in Normandy, but many have applauded his efforts to draw down the American presence in Syria as a step toward stopping endless wars. Others argued that abandoning allies in the region would only allow for more violence and embolden rivals. Critics of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments on Wednesday argued that World War II combatant status was a bizarre subject to invoke, especially since the Kurds were \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and are \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stateless and not a monolith. And in any case, the United States today is friendly with Germany, Japan and Italy, the main Axis powers during World War II. Others questioned whether any member of the Trump family had fought for the United States during World War II and noted that during the Vietnam War, the president received five draft deferments.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The United States and China could announce a limited trade agreement this week that would prevent President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planned tariff increase from going into effect this month and set rules around how China manages its currency, according to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce official who has been briefed by both negotiating teams. Top officials from the two countries are meeting again this week to try to resolve a yearlong trade war that has dragged on amid disagreements over the types of provisions any pact should include. But as the clash begins to inflict economic pain on the global economy, negotiators from both sides seem increasingly focused on reaching a mini-deal that would resolve just a portion of the trade dispute. Myron Brilliant, the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the Chamber of Commerce, told reporters on Thursday that he was \u00e2\u0080\u009chopeful\u00e2\u0080\u009d that a limited arrangement stopping a planned tariff increase on Oct. 15 would emerge from this week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meetings. Mr. Brilliant, who recently spoke with both negotiating teams, added that a more comprehensive pact could be announced this week but that the scope of the deal would depend on what Chinese negotiators brought to the table. The Trump administration could also contemplate removing the threat of additional tariffs that are scheduled to be imposed in December or roll back some of the tariffs it has already levied on more than $360 billion of Chinese goods based on the package of offers brought by the Chinese negotiating team, he said. Such a limited arrangement would not constitute a full resolution and is unlikely to satisfy Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demands that China change many of its economic practices, such as limiting state subsidies to its firms. The deal appears likely to repackage concessions that China has made to the United States in previous months and years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including an agreement reached on currency this year, before a falling-out between the countries in May brought progress to a standstill. Still, a limited deal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which Washington officials have begun referring to as an \u00e2\u0080\u009cearly harvest\u00e2\u0080\u009d or a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconfidence building\u00e2\u0080\u009d measure \u00e2\u0080\u0094 could lower tensions between the United States and China and help to mitigate some of the damage that tariffs and other punitive measures have begun to take on companies on both sides of the fight. Considerations of a limited deal involving currency promises were first reported by Bloomberg. Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Thursday morning that he planned to meet China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top trade envoy, Liu He, on Friday, raising speculation that a more limited deal might be at hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBig day of negotiations with China,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the president wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The trade meetings come amid a growing recognition on both sides that the bilateral relationship has been headed in a troubling direction. Trade between the United States and China has slumped, dragging on both economies. In the United States, uncertainty about the prospect for future tariffs has discouraged businesses from making new hires and investments, an unwelcome development at a time of gathering economic gloom. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford a further escalation of the trade war that will only accelerate the chance of a recession,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Brilliant said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am confident the U.S. administration understands the stakes here on that front.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Administration officials have denied that they are seeking any kind of \u00e2\u0080\u009cpartial\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cinterim\u00e2\u0080\u009d deal. Yet people familiar with their thinking say many are open to the possibility of an arrangement that would roll back some tariffs in return for Chinese agricultural purchases, stronger protections on intellectual property or other concessions. But they caution that it is unclear whether the president will ultimately agree to such an arrangement. Mr. Trump and his advisers are wary of being criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for making a deal that is too weak and giving up the leverage Mr. Trump has created with his tariffs. Announcing some kind of package of concessions this week might pave the way for a larger trade deal when Mr. Trump is next expected to meet President Xi Jinping of China in person, in November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Santiago, Chile, Mr. Brilliant said. Other trade experts expressed support for a positive turn in relations, regardless of what an agreement would be labeled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn eve of China trade talks, I welcome both sides making sufficient progress to forestall future tariff hikes and even some rollbacks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wendy Cutler, a vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and a chief trade negotiator for the Obama administration, tweeted on Wednesday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome call this a partial deal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but i call it announcements of tangible progress that gives momentum to the overall talks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is unclear whether the provisions that might be announced this week would be new, or how much they might change China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic actions. In meetings in February, China and the United States agreed to avoid devaluing their currency to make their products cheaper abroad and give their exporters an advantage, Chinese officials said in March. They also agreed to continue to comply with previous currency agreements among the Group of 20 countries, and disclose detailed information in accordance with standards set by the International Monetary Fund. But this and other agreements were put off in late April, when the Chinese changed the draft trade agreement and American officials accused them of reneging on a pact that was nearly complete. Since then, relations have steadily worsened. In August, the Treasury Department formally labeled China a currency manipulator after Beijing allowed its currency to weaken \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a decline that many economists said was done in line with market forces. Since then, both sides have brandished a series of carrots and sticks in an attempt to pressure each other into a favorable deal. China resumed buying American agricultural goods last month, after ceasing its purchases to put more pressure on American farmers. Chinese officials also quietly dropped earlier public demands that any deal must immediately get rid of all of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s levies, paving the way for a potential interim agreement. Mr. Trump said last month that he would delay a round of tariff increases from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15. Last week, he gave a green light for his administration to issue some licenses allowing American companies to supply goods to the Chinese telecom firm Huawei, which he previously put on a blacklist barring it from buying American goods. But other interim measures have ratcheted up the tension. The Trump administration announced on Monday that it would add 28 more entities to that blacklist, including some of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading artificial intelligence firms. On Tuesday, the State Department announced visa restrictions for Chinese officials accused of involvement in human rights abuses. Many uncertainties remain in the trade talks. In particular, China has appeared unwilling to make many of the more significant changes to its economy that the Trump administration has demanded, including restraining its subsidies to state-owned firms and allowing for the flow of data across its borders. Mr. Brilliant said on Thursday that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promises on intellectual property still revolved around \u00e2\u0080\u009c20th century\u00e2\u0080\u009d issues, like copyrights for movies and software, rather than \u00e2\u0080\u009c21st century\u00e2\u0080\u009d issues involving the use of data. He said that while there could be an announcement on intellectual property this week, it appeared that more fundamental concerns about China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treatment of technology would not be addressed.",

      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 House investigators pounded the Trump administration and its allies on Thursday with new subpoenas, demanding documents from Rick Perry, the energy secretary, and testimony from two more witnesses as they aggressively challenged a White House pledge to starve their impeachment inquiry of evidence. Three Democratic chairmen leading the inquiry instructed Mr. Perry to turn over by next Friday any records that would shed light on President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government to open corruption investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son. Investigators also want answers on whether Mr. Perry tried to influence the management of Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s state-owned gas company. Hours earlier, they demanded that two businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, appear for depositions next Wednesday and hand over records related to their work with Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer. Mr. Giuliani has been the point man in the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pressure campaign on Ukraine, around which the inquiry is centered. The subpoenas came shortly after the two men were indicted on federal campaign finance charges that touched on their work in Ukraine. The new subpoenas, and more in the works, sent a clear message to the White House that Democrats do not intend to back down from a growing constitutional clash over their inquiry, even after the White House defiantly said this week that it would stonewall all requests for witnesses and documents. Rather than waiting out the prolonged negotiations with witnesses that are typical in congressional oversight investigations, Democrats are demanding compliance on tight deadlines and threatening to draft an article of impeachment charging Mr. Trump with obstruction of Congress if his administration does not oblige. In a letter to a lawyer for Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, the three House chairmen wrote that as private citizens, the men were \u00e2\u0080\u009crequired by law to comply with the enclosed subpoenas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was signed by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee; Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee; and Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey may not evade requests from Congress for documents and information necessary to conduct our inquiry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the chairmen wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are not exempted from this requirement merely because they happen to work with Mr. Giuliani, and they may not defy congressional subpoenas merely because President Trump has chosen the path of denial, defiance and obstruction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still, significant questions remained open about which witnesses the House could secure. Lawyers for the C.I.A. whistle-blower whose complaint about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Ukraine prompted the inquiry appeared to be backtracking on earlier expectations that he would sit for an interview with members of Congress. Instead, they proposed a written question-and-answer exchange with the House Intelligence Committee, according to a person familiar with the matter. And lawmakers awaited word from the State Department on whether it would try to block an interview scheduled for Friday with Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine whom Mr. Trump removed after some of his allies concluded that she was impeding efforts to pressure the Ukrainians into opening investigations on Mr. Biden and other Democrats. The latest subpoenas emerged as criticism of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions in the Ukraine matter continued to grow and his defense team appeared to face a setback. Asked whether it was proper for the president to solicit foreign interference in the political process, H.R. McMaster, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former national security adviser, responded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not appropriate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Speaking at an event in Washington on Thursday, Mr. McMaster said it was up to Congress \u00e2\u0080\u009cto make a judgment as to whether or not that happened.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the White House, Mr. Trump questioned why lawmakers would want to talk to Mr. Perry. But he had told Republican lawmakers last week that Mr. Perry had encouraged him to make a much-scrutinized July phone call to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in which Mr. Trump pressured him to investigate political rivals, according to Axios. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many people can they talk to?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said on Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had a simple conversation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Only a day after one of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers announced that Trey Gowdy, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina, would join his private legal team to fight the House inquiry, the president told reporters that Mr. Gowdy actually could not start representing him until January, because of \u00e2\u0080\u009clobbying rules.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Democrats are eyeing an accelerated timetable for their impeachment inquiry that could mean the entire process \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including a House vote to charge the president and a Senate trial \u00e2\u0080\u0094 could be almost over by January. With the White House struggling to calibrate its response, Democrats have moved quickly to paper Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government with requests for information. The subpoena for Mr. Perry follows similar ones sent to the Defense and State Departments, the Office of Management and Budget, Vice President Mike Pence and the White House itself. House investigators believe Mr. Perry may know about crucial exchanges between the United States and Ukraine in recent months. He led an American delegation to Mr. Zelensky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inauguration in May, and news reports have suggested he was aware of Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unusual role in shaping United States-Ukraine relations and may have been employed in Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pressure campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRecently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stark message to the Ukrainian president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the chairmen wrote. Mr. Perry had previously indicated that he would work to answer the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questions, but the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfull halt\u00e2\u0080\u009d on cooperation, as the White House counsel put it in a letter sent to Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday, is likely to complicate that. Mr. Parnas had been scheduled to appear for a deposition on Capitol Hill on Thursday and Mr. Fruman on Friday. But even before their arrests, their lawyer, John M. Dowd, had indicated that they would not comply voluntarily. The subpoenas issued by the House Intelligence Committee to Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman make no mention of the federal indictment. The F.B.I. arrested the two men as they were about to board an international flight late Wednesday, and on Thursday federal prosecutors charged them with funneling foreign money to government officials and campaigns in an effort to influence American policy, including toward Ukraine. The indictments could complicate congressional attempts to get them to testify, raising the issue of whether lawmakers will grant them immunity that would bar the use of their testimony as criminal evidence. At the same time, an assertion of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination would be a lawful basis for the pair to avoid answering questions despite a subpoena. The New York Times reported in May that the two men helped connect Mr. Giuliani to Ukrainian prosecutors who provided him information related to the investigations he wanted into Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, as well as a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukrainian meddling to aid Democrats in the 2016 election. The federal indictment in Manhattan made no mention of Mr. Giuliani, but stated that the men worked with one or more Ukrainian government officials to try to secure the removal of Ms. Yovanovitch as the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ambassador. Mr. Giuliani was seeking Ms. Yovanovitch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s removal, as well, and ultimately the White House called her back to Washington early, having deemed her insufficiently loyal to the president. Other work by Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman also appears to have overlapped with Mr. Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in the Ukrainian state-owned gas company, Naftogaz, which he raised during his May visit to the country. House investigators are scheduled to hear from Ms. Yovanovitch on Friday in a private deposition, but as of late Thursday, it remained unclear if the State Department would try to block her testimony. Democrats were prepared to issue a subpoena to increase pressure if needed. The indictment may also significantly complicate Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to serve as a face of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense. Senate Republicans allied with the president have said they might host a public hearing with Mr. Giuliani in an effort to showcase his accusations against the Bidens and undercut the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment narrative. Now they may decide he is too toxic to expose to public questioning.",

      "content": "LONDON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faltering Brexit negotiations with the European Union got a lifeline on Thursday from an unexpectedly upbeat meeting between the leaders of Britain and Ireland, with both saying they could see \u00e2\u0080\u009ca pathway to a possible deal\u00e2\u0080\u009d to handle issues over Northern Ireland. Meeting at a hotel outside Liverpool, England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Prime Minister Leo Varadkar discussed Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal, which would take Northern Ireland out of the European customs union, along with Britain, but leave it aligned with many other European Union regulations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoth continue to believe that a deal is in everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a vaguely worded joint statement issued by the leaders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still, for all the encouraging mood music, it was hard to judge whether Mr. Johnson and Mr. Varadkar had actually closed any gaps between them or were merely putting a diplomatic gloss on a negotiating effort that could fail before the Oct. 31 deadline for Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure from Europe. They did not cite concrete progress on vexing issues, like customs checkpoints, which Ireland opposes, or the need for Northern Ireland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assembly to approve the arrangement, which Britain is demanding. But neither did they repeat their past disagreements on these issues. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Varadkar said he believed Britain and Europe could strike a deal before Oct. 31. But he acknowledged potential sticking points, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many a slip between cup and lip.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The normally voluble Mr. Johnson left without speaking to the press. Mr. Varadkar said he hoped the meeting would give fresh momentum to parallel talks between Britain and the European Union, which had largely ground to a halt. Diplomats said a meeting on Friday between the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and the European Union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, would be crucial in determining whether talks intensify before a decisive summit of European leaders on Oct. 17. Mr. Varadkar and Mr. Johnson met for two and a half hours and took a private walk around the grounds of the hotel, a manor normally used for upscale weddings. The atmospherics suggested that neither side was ready to give up, even though British officials have already pointed fingers at what they say are intransigent Europeans and the obdurate Irish. Mr. Varadkar has been blunt about his objections to Mr. Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal, notably its requirement that Northern Ireland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assembly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which has been suspended since its governing coalition collapsed in January 2017 in a sectarian dispute \u00e2\u0080\u0094 be given a veto over the plan once every four years. Before the meeting, Mr. Varadkar said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPart of the difficulty at the moment, though, is the position of the U.K. government that Northern Ireland must leave the E.U. customs union and be part of the U.K. customs union, no matter what the people of Northern Ireland think. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their position at the moment, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of grave difficulty to us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d British officials have floated various remedies to this problem, like having the major political parties in Northern Ireland \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which represent both British unionists and Irish nationalists \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sign on to an agreement, in lieu of the assembly. Another option is to impose a time limit on the deal, but set that date well in the future, giving Ireland hope that the north might never be divided from the south. Finding a compromise on the issue of \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsent\u00e2\u0080\u009d was expected to occupy most of Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meeting, though Mr. Johnson and Mr. Varadkar also said they had discussed the customs union. Of the two issues, consent is easier to resolve: Some of the details could be left until later, if the two sides reach agreement on basic principles. The customs union is far harder: Britain argues it is necessary as a point of principle and to get a deal through Parliament. But it would require installing customs checks, although Britain insists such checks could be done away from the border between north and south. Those are an obstacle for Ireland for practical reasons \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they would interrupt the now seamless trade across the border \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as a symbolic one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a hard border could threaten the peace that has prevailed since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement resolved years of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland. The European Union and individual European leaders have steadfastly backed Ireland, generally echoing Mr. Varadkar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objections. On Wednesday, Mr. Barnier told the European Parliament: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not really in a position where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to find an agreement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Johnson has threatened to leave the bloc without a deal if he cannot strike an agreement before Oct. 31. But that outcome seems less likely because of a Parliamentary law requiring the prime minister to ask the European Union for an extension by Oct. 19, if he does not achieve a deal. As the days tick down, the British government has seemingly adopted a two-track strategy: Downing Street officials, usually anonymously, blame either the Irish or the European Union for torpedoing a deal, while the government quietly continues to look for ways to break the impasse. Mr. Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meeting with Mr. Varadkar, held away from television cameras and the politically charged terrain of London or Dublin, was part of that second track. But British officials have also leaked a series of threats and warnings about what could happen if there is no deal by month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end.",

Barr met privately Wednesday evening with Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul who is one of President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frequent confidants but whose Fox News is viewed by the president as more hostile toward him than it used to be. The meeting was held at Mr. Murdoch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home in New York, according to someone familiar with it. It was unclear if anyone else attended or what was discussed. Aides to both Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Barr declined requests for comment on the meeting. [Related: Anchor Shepard Smith abruptly leaves Fox News.] The visit took place as the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump by House Democrats has gathered momentum. Mr. Barr has emerged as a key defender of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerns about the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Barr was criticized in the spring for his handling of the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, before it was released publicly. Mr. Trump has sought out Mr. Murdoch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion on a wide range of issues in the past, and Fox News has provided Mr. Trump with key support both as a candidate and as president. Recently, Fox News personalities have questioned the validity of efforts by House Democrats to impeach the president. They have also helped draw attention to the debunked theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election to aid Democrats, a theory favored by Mr. Trump but which contradicts the findings of American intelligence communities and the Mueller report that Russia intervened in the election to help Republicans. And anchors such as Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham have remained vocally supportive of the president. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump believes that the network has become more critical of him, and he has grown increasingly critical of Fox News, denouncing some anchors and reporters he does not consider to be friendly to him, such as Shepard Smith and even Ed Henry, with whom he held a recent interview. And while Mr. Trump talks frequently with Tucker Carlson, another Fox News host, Mr. Carlson has been critical of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s July call with the president of Ukraine, which prompted the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Carlson said in a column for The Daily Caller website that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cno way\u00e2\u0080\u009d to spin what took place on that call as a positive for Mr. Trump. On Thursday morning, Mr. Trump lashed out at Fox News over a poll it commissioned on attitudes toward the impeachment inquiry. The poll showed that 51 percent of people surveyed believe that Mr. Trump should be impeached and removed from office. Another 4 percent said he should be impeached but not removed, and 40 percent said they are against impeaching Mr. Trump. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump posted on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In another tweet, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009c@FoxNews doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m President!\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one question about impeachment that no Democratic presidential candidate wants to answer head on. Should Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son Hunter have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president? In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work and his service as vice president. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right: There is no evidence that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from his overseas work or that his father intervened inappropriately with Ukraine or China on his behalf, as President Trump has falsely claimed. But in politics, appearances matter. Just ask Hillary Clinton or Mr. Trump, or for that matter, anyone who has ever run for office. At a moment when a populist, anti-establishment fervor runs through both parties, the image of Hunter Biden doing business in Ukraine and China while his father played a prominent role in American foreign policy could quickly become a political liability \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a fact that clearly concerns Mr. Biden and his team, given their fierce efforts to denounce the story. So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. Former Representative Beto O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke suggested, albeit mildly, that Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work posed a problem, telling reporters, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not allow a family member, anyone in my cabinet to have a family member, to work in a position like that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senator Cory Booker called Mr. Biden \u00e2\u0080\u009ctruly an honorable man\u00e2\u0080\u009d on CNN last week, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is in no way can besmirch his character, his honor and his incredible service to this country over decades.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But, he noted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just do not think that children of presidents, of vice presidents during an administration should be out there doing that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senator Amy Klobuchar took a similar position when asked whether she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be comfortable with the child of her vice president sitting on the board of a foreign company. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can promise you right now, my own daughter, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only 24, does not sit on the board of a foreign company,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, also on CNN. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut that is not the issue. The issue here is what the president is doing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Much of the rest of field has largely dodged the question. Senator Elizabeth Warren initially said she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know when asked whether her ethics plan would prevent a top official\u00e2\u0080\u0099s child from getting a job with a foreign company. Since then, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pivoted back to Mr. Trump when asked similar questions. And Senator Kamala Harris, when asked about the issue, has taken to simply saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeave Joe Biden alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback. The questions surrounding his son may be even more sensitive: Democratic voters generally feel warmly toward \u00e2\u0080\u009cUncle Joe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d particularly when it comes to his family, which has been deeply marked by the tragic deaths of his first wife and infant daughter and his elder son, Beau. Echoing an attack introduced and continually leveraged \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in false ways \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by Mr. Trump could risk raising Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ire. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean the question won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be asked at the CNN/New York Times debate on Tuesday night. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the questions will be, but my bet is on the topic coming up (Marc Lacey, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re listening\u00e2\u0080\u00a6). Whether a candidate takes the gamble will be interesting to watch. So, yes, The Times and CNN are co-hosting the next Democratic debate in Ohio on Tuesday.

My colleague Jennifer Medina wrote this week about Juli\u00c3\u00a1n Castro, his activist mother and the political power of third-generation immigrants. She dug into the demographics for us. Who is an American? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a question that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just beneath the surface of many debates over race and immigration. In dozens of conversations with Latinos whose families have lived in the United States for generations, there was one sentiment they nearly all shared: They suddenly felt their own Americanness was being called into question. The idea of a perpetual foreignness is hardly new. Mexican-Americans have been fighting that perception for generations, as Rosie Castro, the Chicana activist and mother of Juli\u00c3\u00a1n Castro, the only Latino running for president, recently told me. Just how many Latinos come from families who have lived in the United States for at least three generations? Demographers at the Pew Research Center put the figure at 17 million, roughly 30 percent of the Latino population over all. That percentage has remained steady over the last several years, while the percentage of foreign-born Latinos dropped to below 50 percent in 2013, and is now at 48 percent. For years, many political leaders like Mr. Castro saw the power of Latinos increasing, but the Trump era has made clear how elusive that power might be. So, now, they are directly discussing race and embracing the kind of rhetoric they once shied away from \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the kind their second-generation parents used in the 1960s.

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Former Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who is seeking a return to Congress, was caught in the fallout of the Ukraine scandal on Thursday when he was referred to in the indictment of two presidential allies accused of campaign finance allegations. Mr. Sessions, who served 11 terms in Congress until he was swept out last year, is described as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongressman-1\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested and charged on Thursday with illegally funneling foreign money to American political candidates and campaigns. The two men are associates of Rudolph W. Giuliani \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer and a point man in Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on his political rivals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and are believed to be important witnesses in the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment inquiry. Mr. Sessions\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance in the indictment, which was filed just a week after he announced he would run for Congress in 2020, was an early and potentially damaging blow to his campaign. Mr. Sessions is not named in the indictment, nor is he accused of any wrongdoing. On Thursday, he issued a statement that denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by federal prosecutors. But a review of campaign finance records and his public comments show that he is the lawmaker referred to in the indictment as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCongressman-1,\u00e2\u0080\u009d who is described as having received large campaign contributions from Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, and whom Mr. Parnas asked for help in removing the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch. Ms. Yovanovitch had resisted Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to persuade the Ukrainians to open a corruption investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, as well as other Democrats, a top priority of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry. According to the indictment and campaign finance records, Mr. Sessions received the maximum allowable campaign donation of $2,700 in 2018 from both Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, as well as nearly $3 million in donations from America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC to which both had contributed. The pair\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contributions were part of a broader effort \u00e2\u0080\u009cso that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns and the candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 governments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d federal prosectors said. Mr. Sessions met the two men at a fund-raising event, and they later committed to raising $20,000 for him. The 21-page indictment asserted that Mr. Parnas met with Mr. Sessions \u00e2\u0080\u009cat and around the same time\u00e2\u0080\u009d he committed to raising money for the Texas Republican, and that Mr. Parnas asked the congressman to help oust Ms. Yovanovitch, who was eventually recalled by the Trump administration. That effort, federal lawyers concluded, was \u00e2\u0080\u009cconducted, at least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sessions conceded in his statement on Thursday that he had, indeed, sought Ms. Yovanovitch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s removal \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter several congressional colleagues reported to me that the current U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was disparaging President Trump to others as part of those official duties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sessions said Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman first approached him to discuss \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe strategic need for Ukraine to become energy independent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt no time did I take any official action after these meetings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The indictment was an unwelcome development for Mr. Sessions at the start of what was already shaping up as a potentially competitive primary for a seat in a safe Republican district. Rather than seeking to reclaim his old seat from Representative Colin Allred, the Democrat who ousted him in a Dallas district last year, Mr. Sessions announced last week that he would run to succeed the retiring Representative Bill Flores in a district 80 miles south. With his loss to Mr. Allred fresh in their minds, some Republicans were already unsure whether Mr. Sessions would be the strongest candidate to succeed Mr. Flores. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis could definitely damage his chances in the district \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with voters, with people who are trying to play kingmaker,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brendan Steinhauser, an Austin-based Republican strategist. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be another argument from those who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want him to run for this seat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Flores has already cast doubt on Mr. Sessions\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, telling The Texas Tribune this month that Mr. Sessions had announced it without first consulting him and that feedback from district Republican leaders about him was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot positive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Other potential candidates have tested the waters, and conversations have centered on two Texans with national security credentials: David Springer, a lawyer who worked at the National Counterterrorism Center and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and Jeff Oppenheim, a defense consultant and West Point graduate. Mr. Sessions was not the only lawmaker to benefit from Mr. Parnas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largess. Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, and Representative Joe Wilson, Republican of South Carolina, also received the maximum campaign contribution allowed by the Federal Election Commission, according to campaign finance records. Mr. Parnas also donated $3,800 to House Republicans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 campaign arm, and Mr. Fruman donated nearly $67,000 under the name Igor Furman, according to campaign finance records. House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 campaign arm called on the Republican leader and House Republicans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 campaign arm on Thursday to return the contributions. On Thursday afternoon, Mr. McCarthy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spokesman said he would do so. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe deception documented in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indictment has no place in our country and as a result, McCarthy plans to donate amounts received to a local charity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Matt Sparks, the spokesman. The fallout from the Ukraine scandal continued to widen among veteran government officials late Thursday. Michael McKinley, a top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a career diplomat who served as ambassador to Brazil, Afghanistan, Colombia and Peru, has resigned over concerns related to the matter, said one person familiar with the decision. Current and former officials say Mr. Pompeo had lost the trust of many department employees over his failure to defend diplomats whom the president criticized over the Ukraine issue, his backing of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partisan stand on Ukraine and his public support of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s line on allowing Turkey to attack the Kurds, who have been able partners of the United States military in the fight against the Islamic State. Mr. McKinley and the State Department did not return requests for comment on Thursday night.",

      "content": "The cast of characters, both major and peripheral, involved in President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ukraine saga continues to grow. New details emerged about some of them on Thursday after the indictment of two associates of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private lawyer. Arrested as they sought to leave the country with one-way tickets, Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s associates, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, have both been called to testify in the House impeachment inquiry. Mr. Parnas was born in Ukraine, and Mr. Fruman in Belarus. Both are now American citizens, based in southern Florida. Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indictment charges them with camouflaging political donations in order to advance the political interests of Ukrainian government officials as well as their own business interests. Over the past two years, they appear to have been pursuing two distinct goals. One was to help Mr. Giuliani oust the American ambassador to Ukraine and gather negative information about the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in that country. Allegations that Mr. Trump pressured Volodymyr Zelensky, the newly elected president of Ukraine, to investigate the Bidens in exchange for a White House meeting or military aid \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or both \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are at the center of the impeachment inquiry. The pair\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other goal was to use political contributions in order to change state and federal policies to further their recreational marijuana business venture. An unnamed foreigner with \u00e2\u0080\u009cRussian roots\u00e2\u0080\u009d gave them $1 million for that purpose, according to the indictment. It is illegal for foreigners to donate to American political campaigns. Both men appear to have met Mr. Trump. Mr. Parnas posted a photograph of himself with the president on Twitter in June, saying he was honored to call Mr. Trump his friend. Mr. Fruman told one news outlet that Mr. Trump invited him to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., in March 2018 for one of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first fund-raising events for the 2020 election. Last year, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman donated $325,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action. They claimed the funds came from an energy company they had recently created. In fact, the firm had no income and no assets, according to the indictment. Prosecutors stated the funds came from a transaction between Mr. Fruman and third parties whom they did not name. In an intriguing development, Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indictment cites Mr. Parnas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to help Mr. Giuliani and others oust Ms. Yovanovitch as the American ambassador in Ukraine. The State Department recalled her to the United States in May, months before the scheduled end of her tenure. How she lost her post is a key part of the impeachment inquiry. Ms. Yovanovitch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critics alleged that she was disloyal to Mr. Trump. One informal adviser to the president made an unsubstantiated claim that she had told Ukrainian officials to ignore Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies because he would be impeached. In his July call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump described the ambassador as \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad news,\u00e2\u0080\u009d warning, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to go through some things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Allies of Ms. Yovanovitch say they fear she was removed because she was an obstacle to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hopes that Ukraine would investigate the Bidens. Numerous foreign policy experts describe the three-time ambassador as highly competent and nonpartisan. She is scheduled to testify Friday in the House impeachment inquiry, but it is unclear whether the administration, which claims the inquiry is not legitimate, will allow her to appear. So far, neither she nor her lawyers have commented publicly. Mr. Sessions, a former Republican congressman from Texas, is referred to in the indictment, but not by name. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman contributed to his 2018 re-election campaign, disguising one contribution to avoid campaign finance limits. The indictment alleges that Mr. Parnas recruited Mr. Sessions, then the chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, to help try to oust Ms. Yovanovitch. At the same time, he and Mr. Fruman promised to help Mr. Sessions raise more than $20,000 for re-election. In a letter last year to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mr. Sessions accused Ms. Yovanovitch of disloyalty to the president. Mr. Sessions lost his re-election bid, but announced this month that he was running for a different Texas congressional seat in 2020. He said Thursday that he knew nothing about the campaign finance scheme, and that he criticized the ambassador for one reason only: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe that political appointees should not be disparaging the president, especially while serving overseas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Both men were charged in the indictment, but not in connection with Ukraine. Rather, they were involved in the scheme with Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman to influence state and federal politicians to help get licenses for a recreational marijuana business. The business venture ultimately failed. Born in Ukraine, Mr. Kukushkin, 46, is an American citizen living in the San Francisco area. Mr. Correia, 44, an American businessman, has described himself as an entrepreneur who works for a company that says it helps investors reduce the risk of fraud. The influence-peddling scheme involved an unnamed foreigner with \u00e2\u0080\u009cRussian roots\u00e2\u0080\u009d who transferred $1 million \u00e2\u0080\u009cto cover all the donations\u00e2\u0080\u009d to federal candidates, as well as state candidates and politicians in Nevada, New York and elsewhere. In Nevada, the men missed the application deadline but hoped officials would grant them a license anyway. They donated $10,000 to Wesley Karl Duncan, a Republican candidate running for attorney general in Nevada, who lost. Mr. Fruman also donated $10,000 to Adam Laxalt, then the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney general who was running for governor. He also lost, but remains an influential politician in Nevada, a critical state in the presidential race. In October 2018, Mr. Laxalt spoke at a Trump rally in Elko, Nev. Last month, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, traveled to a Nevada event hosted by Mr. Laxalt, according to news reports. The indictment states that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman both worked for at least one Ukrainian government official who tried to remove the American ambassador. It was not immediately clear who that was, or whether the individual was still in the government. Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government turned over this May after Mr. Zelensky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election. Yuriy Lutsenko, a fierce opponent of Ms. Yovanovitch, was fired. Mr. Trump appeared to praise Mr. Lutsenko in his July phone call with the Ukrainian president. But Mr. Lutsenko was by no means the only Ukrainian official critical of Ms. Yovanovitch, who vigorously complained about corruption in the Ukrainian government, including in the prosecutor general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office. Another official, still in the government, is Kostiantyn Kulyk, a deputy prosecutor. Allegations of corruption made him toxic in the eyes of some American officials.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 No one should have been surprised, and yet it seems that everyone was. President Trump made clear long ago that he wanted to get out of the Middle East, but even some of his own supporters evidently assumed that he would not follow through or that someone would stop him. As a result, the international crisis that many of his opponents feared for so long has finally arrived, but it is one of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own making and one that pits him against his own party and his own government. The Turkish assault on America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kurdish allies that he effectively facilitated reflects his foreign policy in its rawest Trumpian form. It is a foreign policy built primarily on reflex and increasingly resistant to outside advice. Unimpressed by the national security establishment and uninterested in the tedium of traditional policymaking, Mr. Trump often demonstrates more faith in what some overseas strongman tells him than the soft-boiled guidance of the bureaucrats, diplomats, intelligence analysts and military officers in the Situation Room. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis may be the riskiest national security decision that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made to this point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Richard Fontaine, the chief executive of the Center for a New American Security and a former aide to President George W. Bush. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned anything new about the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision-making style, but it does reveal the very significant risks that that style carries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Having upended Middle East policy with the flick of a Twitter finger, however, Mr. Trump now is trying to find a way to reverse the eminently foreseeable consequences as Turkish forces bombard the same Kurdish fighters who helped the United States overpower the Islamic State. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper called his Turkish counterpart on Thursday to stress that Washington opposes the incursion into Syria, and Mr. Trump talked of brokering some form of peace between Turkey and the Kurds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope we can mediate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told reporters even as he contemplates sanctions against Turkey. But the administration signaled that it was still giving the Turks a degree of latitude. A State Department official, who briefed reporters under ground rules that he not be identified, said the administration would impose costs if Turkey went \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeyond the lines,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he defined as ethnic cleansing or indiscriminate artillery and airstrikes directed at civilians. That would suggest that Turkish forces that crossed the border into northern Syria on Wednesday could hit Kurdish fighters hard, but not slaughter them, without provoking American reaction. At the same time, the Kurds have been counterattacking, firing off shells at Turkish border villages as the danger of escalation spiraled. Ever since the president abruptly announced his decision on Sunday night to remove about 50 to 100 American troops who served as a sort of trip wire along the border, effectively clearing the way for the Turkish incursion, the administration has scrambled to catch up. Senior officials across the government were caught off guard, and many shared the outrage expressed publicly by Republican lawmakers who called the move an abandonment of American allies. From the highest levels of the Pentagon to the rank-and-file Special Forces in northern Syria, there was a deep sense of betrayal as troops were ordered to leave behind Kurdish allies they had gotten to know and trust. The troops along the border have all now been pulled back and relocated to bases deeper in Syria \u00e2\u0080\u0094 posts still guarded by Syrian Kurdish fighters. Three American officials said all counterterrorism operations by the Syrian Kurds have been suspended while they focus on fighting the Turks, several dozen missions a day. A scaled-back Kurdish jailer force is still securing Islamic State detainees at 20 locations around Syria, at least for now. American diplomats described frustration at the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deference to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, with whom he talked shortly before announcing his decision on Sunday, and insisted that the new Syria policy was being directed by Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not the State Department. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump clearly does not consider the second-order impact of his decisions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said R. Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state under Mr. Bush. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis one move to appease Erdogan is now costing him and the U.S. something that is difficult to earn back quickly: our credibility as a reliable ally.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Turkish invasion also revealed a bitter new facet in a long-established divide between the Pentagon and the State Department in handling international conflicts. Senior military officials this week have privately \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but adamantly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 accused Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of being too passive in dealing with Mr. Erdogan, and of failing to push back on the Turkish leader to protect the Kurdish fighters allied with American troops. But senior State Department officials on Thursday described hours of telephone calls to foreign leaders and other meetings in which Mr. Pompeo has sought to ease the tensions in northern Syria \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including to try to help broker a cease-fire between Turkey and the Kurds. One senior State Department official described various diplomatic exchanges that have involved Mr. Erdogan. The tension between the State and Defense Departments also reflects divergent views of the Turkish-Kurdish conflict. Amanda Sloat, a former American diplomat who focused on Turkey during the Obama administration, said the State Department had long been more sympathetic to Turkey, which it sees as a stabilizing force in the Middle East, while the military came to see the Kurds as \u00e2\u0080\u009ctheir brothers in arms\u00e2\u0080\u009d against the Islamic State. Until now, Ms. Sloat said that \u00e2\u0080\u009ctheir perspectives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including a single-minded focus on defeating the Islamic State irrespective of the longer-term consequences \u00e2\u0080\u0094 usually won the day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With the Islamic State now crippled, though, Mr. Trump returned to his longstanding desire to get out of the region. His view that the United States has little business getting in the middle of fights like the Turkish-Kurdish conflict reflects years of national fatigue with overseas adventures and resonates with many Americans. Having failed recently to seal a peace agreement with the Taliban in Afghanistan, Mr. Trump clearly sees Syria as one place where he could make progress toward withdrawing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am trying to end the ENDLESS WARS,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote on Twitter on Thursday. If his actions leave the Kurds to the mercies of the Turks, Mr. Trump seemed only modestly concerned this week. After all, as he put it on Wednesday, the Kurds \u00e2\u0080\u009cdidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help us with Normandy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Their assistance against the Islamic State was self-interested, he said, not an act of support for the United States. Indeed, Mr. Trump and his allies picked up the theme that it was really President Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fault for tying the United States so closely with the Kurds in the first place. At the same time, the timing has its own domestic risks for Mr. Trump. His decision to abandon the Kurds sent his more hawkish Republican allies in Congress into paroxysms of anger at the same time the president needs a unified party to stave off removal from office in his impeachment inquiry. But Mr. Trump has pushed back at his critics, saying it was well past time to move on from Middle East wars. For nearly three years, he has been restrained from going as far as he wanted to fulfilling that goal, and his Syria decision was an act of rebellion from the establishment that has resisted him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe won, we left the area,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told reporters on Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we want to go back in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "During a contentious Oval Office meeting with President Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017, Rudolph W. Giuliani pressed for help in securing the release of a jailed client, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader, as part of a potential prisoner swap with Turkey. The request by Mr. Giuliani provoked an immediate objection from Mr. Tillerson, who argued that it would be highly inappropriate to interfere in an open criminal case, according to two people briefed on the meeting. The gold trader, Reza Zarrab, had been accused by federal prosecutors of playing a central role in an effort by a state-owned Turkish bank to funnel more than $10 billion worth of gold and cash to Iran, in defiance of United States sanctions designed to curb Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear program. But at the White House meeting in early 2017, Mr. Giuliani and his longtime friend and colleague, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, pushed back on Mr. Tillerson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objections. Rather than side with his secretary of state, Mr. Trump told them to work it out themselves, according to the two people briefed on the meeting. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter. In the end, no such prisoner swap took place. But the episode has opened a new chapter in Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to interject himself into the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diplomacy while at times representing clients with a direct interest in the outcome. The Oval Office meeting occurred before Mr. Giuliani became Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer for the special counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Russia investigation. In recent weeks, Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign to press Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of one of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political rivals, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., has thrust him into the middle of the House impeachment inquiry. And on Wednesday, two of Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s associates in that campaign were arrested on charges of violating federal campaign finance laws. [How did Mr. Giuliani get here? Watch a new episode of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Weekly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d our television show, on FX.] Mr. Giuliani, in an interview on Thursday, defended his actions in the gold trader case, which were first reported on Wednesday by Bloomberg. Mr. Giuliani, well known for his hawkish views on Iran, said he had been willing to represent Mr. Zarrab because the proposed prisoner swap would have secured the release of an American pastor who was being held in Turkey on terrorism-related charges the United States considered fabricated. He likened his efforts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which also included apprising Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, of what he wanted \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to maneuvers during the Cold War to trade enemy spies for Americans detained overseas. Mr. Giuliani questioned how his actions were any different. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt happened to be a good trade,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI expected to be a hero like in a Tom Hanks movie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But his involvement, as a private citizen and friend of the president in the months after Mr. Trump passed him over for the role of secretary of state, left some in the administration uncomfortable, given the strained and complicated relationship between the United States and Turkey. Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moves also ran counter to a long-running American effort to curb Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear program as the United States was trying to punish players, like Mr. Zarrab, who helped the regime evade sanctions. The case, called the single largest evasion of Iranian sanctions in United States history, revolved around a scheme by the Turkish bank in 2012 and 2013 to send billions of dollars in gold and cash to Iran in exchange for oil and natural gas. Mr. Zarrab, who has Turkish and Iranian citizenship, was arrested in Florida in March 2016 on a family trip to Disney World, and was accused of an illicit operation that relied on false documents and front companies to move the assets to Iran from the accounts of Halkbank, the second-largest state-owned lender in Turkey. Getting him out of the United States was a high priority for Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, because Mr. Zarrab had information that would later implicate senior bank officials, as well as Turkish government officials, in the scheme. Indeed, after the prison swap failed, Mr. Zarrab became a key witness and testified that in 2012, Mr. Erdogan, then Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prime minister, had ordered that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in the sanction-evasion scheme. Mr. Giuliani said that he was brought into the effort by Mr. Mukasey, who had been hired by Mr. Zarrab\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman. The two men had been pressing their case with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in early 2017 when Mr. Tillerson joined the conversation, according to the two people briefed on the meeting. Mr. Tillerson, who could not be reached for comment, was surprised to find Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey at what he thought would be a regular private meeting with the president, the people said. Mr. Trump asked Mr. Giuliani to tell Mr. Tillerson what he wanted, which prompted Mr. Tillerson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objections. Mr. Mukasey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spokesman did not return a request for comment. Mr. Giuliani, in the interview on Thursday, disputed the account provided to The New York Times of his discussion with Mr. Tillerson about Mr. Zarrab \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the assertion that Mr. Tillerson replied that such a step was inappropriate. But Mr. Giuliani did not specify what aspects of the account he found inaccurate, saying he could not discuss the meeting because of attorney-client privilege. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a completely malicious story coming from the consistent attack on me to try to destroy my credibility,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Giuliani said. He added that at the time, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnobody ever complained\u00e2\u0080\u009d to him from the Trump administration about his role in the case. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey were persistent in the effort. Court filings show that they discussed the matter with State Department officials in Turkey before meeting with Mr. Erdogan himself, and that Mr. Sessions and Preet Bharara, then the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, were informed \u00e2\u0080\u009con a confidential basis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Giuliani argued in court filings that \u00e2\u0080\u009cnone of the transactions in which Mr. Zarrab is alleged to have participated involved weapons or nuclear technology, or any other contraband, but rather involved consumer goods, and that Turkey is situated in a part of the world strategically critical to the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Mr. Mukasey, in an April 2017 court filing, asserted that \u00e2\u0080\u009csenior U.S. officials have remained receptive to pursuing the possibility of an agreement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But officials at the United States attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office in Manhattan remained opposed to the Zarrab trade, as did Mr. Tillerson. Mr. Giuliani, in the Thursday interview, said he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure why the proposal fell apart. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear is that Mr. Zarrab pleaded guilty in October 2017 to the charges, and became a key witness in federal criminal cases prosecuted in New York that led to the conviction of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Halkbank. During Mr. Atilla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criminal trial in late 2017, the judge overseeing the case criticized Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in trying to secure Mr. Zarrab\u00e2\u0080\u0099s freedom, noting that such a move might benefit Iran. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost respectfully, the Giuliani and Mukasey affidavits appear surprisingly disingenuous in failing to mention the central role of Iran in the indictment, and indeed, failing to mention Iran at all in their affidavits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the judge, Richard M. Berman, said, citing statements in which the men suggested Mr. Zarrab\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release might help the United States. Mr. Atilla was sentenced to 32 months in prison. But he was released early from jail in July and then returned to Turkey, where he was greeted at the airport like a hero in Istanbul by Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treasury and finance minister, Berat Albayrak, who is also Mr. Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son-in-law. Mr. Zarrab\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whereabouts have not been disclosed by the United States government. The American pastor, Andrew Brunson, was also released, without a trade involving Mr. Zarrab, in October 2018. The move was credited with an overall improvement in relations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan.",

      "content": "MINNEAPOLIS \u00e2\u0080\u0094 A fired-up President Trump lashed out against Democrats at a combative campaign rally on Thursday night, deriding them as \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery sick and deranged people\u00e2\u0080\u009d who were only investigating him for abuse of power in order to \u00e2\u0080\u009cerase your vote.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Facing impeachment in the House, Mr. Trump took his case to his core supporters, arguing that Democrats were trying to overturn the 2016 election because they knew they could not beat him in 2020. He singled out former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as nothing but a toady for President Barack Obama. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was only a good vice president because he knew how to kiss Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ass,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said, a line that drew huge roars of approval from the crowd. In his first campaign rally since Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the formal beginning of an impeachment inquiry last month, Mr. Trump was as raw and rancorous as ever, targeting individual Democrats in highly personal terms that no president has used in public and presenting himself as a victim of a partisan conspiracy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom Day 1, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump told a crowd of about 20,000 at the Target Center in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic cities in the country. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want to erase your vote like it never existed; they want to erase your voice, and they want to erase your future.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He fired off insults in rapid succession at F.B.I. agents, lawmakers and journalists who he said were out to get him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either really stupid or she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really lost it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or maybe there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a certain dishonesty in there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of Ms. Pelosi. Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, who is one of his favorite targets, is an \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica-hating socialist\u00e2\u0080\u009d who married her brother in order to come into the country, he said. (No proof has emerged substantiating the marriage claim.) He went local in targeting the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic mayor, Jacob Frey, who drew the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ire this week for seeking reimbursement for the cost of extra security required for the rally. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou got a rotten mayor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to change your mayor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But no Democrat came under as much fire as Mr. Biden, one of the leading Democrats bidding to challenge him next year. It was Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to pressure Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president to come up with damaging information about Mr. Biden that prompted the House impeachment inquiry that now threatens his presidency. Mr. Trump maintained he was interested only in uncovering supposed corruption by the former vice president and his younger son, Hunter Biden, who made $50,000 a month serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company at the same time his father was working on Ukraine policy for the Obama administration. In scathing terms, Mr. Trump mocked Hunter Biden, who struggled for years with alcohol and drug abuse and was discharged from the Navy Reserve after failing a drug test. Calling him unqualified for the energy company post, Mr. Trump declared that Hunter Biden was \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot too smart\u00e2\u0080\u009d and added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHunter, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a loser.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He noted that Hunter Biden had been out of the public spotlight in the past couple of weeks as the president and his supporters have sought to make him a political liability for the former vice president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever happened to Hunter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump demanded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere the hell is he? Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hunter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turning to a group of supporters, the president said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, fellas, I have an idea for a new T-shirt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It should say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hunter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. Mr. Trump was proudly on offense all night, cheerfully using the word \u00e2\u0080\u009chell\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeatedly while mocking those who say he should watch his language. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m energized,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told the crowd. At another point, he reveled in his ad hoc blasts at his enemies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it much better when I go off script?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked. The rally, the first of three in the next week, came on a day of rapidly advancing developments in the impeachment inquiry and related matters. Energy Secretary Rick Perry was subpoenaed on Thursday for records that could shed light on any role he may have played in Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two of associates of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, were indicted on campaign finance charges. And Mr. Trump told reporters that the man just announced as his outside counsel, Trey Gowdy, could not start in that position until January because of \u00e2\u0080\u009clobbying rules,\u00e2\u0080\u009d even as House Democrats hope to have an impeachment vote wrapped up by the holidays. Despite the fast-moving inquiry unfolding in Washington, Mr. Trump showed that he, too, was barreling forward in his re-election campaign, using impeachment as fuel to energize his hard-core supporters while trying to expand the electoral map. This time, his campaign is pouring resources into a state with the hopes of putting Democrats on defense and projecting confidence that they have more paths to re-election than simply recreating the winning map from 2016. Mr. Trump lost Minnesota by 1.5 percentage points to Hillary Clinton in 2016, despite having no campaign staff on the ground and barely setting foot in the state. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are going to win this state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said as he took the stage Thursday night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis feels like the day before the election.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to visit Ms. Omar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backyard was also a show of confidence, challenging a local congresswoman in her home state. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked the crowd, calling her one of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig reasons\u00e2\u0080\u009d that he would win re-election. He bemoaned the fact that so many Somali refugees had been allowed to resettle in Minnesota and boasted that he had closed the door to many foreigners seeking protection in the United States. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have reduced refugee resettlement by 85 percent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Outside the Target Center, Trump protesters clashed with Trump supporters, their shouting and cursing escalating as the president took the stage. Many said the longtime Democratic state suddenly felt like a battleground, and strangers approached each other to pick fights. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me why you like him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one man yelled at a nearby Trump supporter. Criticized by another protester for the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s white supremacist undertones, the Trump supporter replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could have 100 black people with me if I wanted to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cameron Russell, 26, of Minneapolis, a donor support technician who is black, voiced his skepticism: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYo, man \u00e2\u0080\u0094 pull them up. Call them up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then Mr. Russell recognized the Trump supporter, who is white, as a high school classmate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you were cool,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Russell said to him.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 When Rudolph W. Giuliani set out to dredge up damaging information on President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rivals in Ukraine, he turned to a native of the former Soviet republic with whom he already had a lucrative business relationship. Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian-American businessman with a trail of debts and lawsuits, had known Mr. Giuliani casually for years through Republican political circles. Last year, their relationship deepened when a company he helped found retained Mr. Giuliani \u00e2\u0080\u0094 associates of Mr. Parnas said he told them he paid hundreds of thousands of dollars \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for what Mr. Giuliani said on Thursday was business and legal advice. Even as he worked with Mr. Parnas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company, Fraud Guarantee, Mr. Giuliani increasingly relied on Mr. Parnas to carry out Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quest for evidence in Ukraine that would undercut the legitimacy of the special counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation into Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interference on his behalf in the 2016 election and help him heading into his 2020 re-election campaign. Mr. Giuliani dispatched Mr. Parnas and an associate, Igor Fruman, a Belarusian-American businessman, to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, where, despite fending off creditors at home, BuzzFeed reported, they ran up big charges at a strip club and the Hilton International hotel. Their mission was to find people and information that could be used to undermine the special counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation, and also to damage former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a prospective Democratic challenger to Mr. Trump. [Rudy Giuliani was a zero-tolerance mayor who cleaned up New York as he inflamed racial tensions. He was hailed as \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mayor\u00e2\u0080\u009d after 9/11. Now, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the center of the Trump impeachment inquiry. Watch \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Weekly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d our new TV show, on FX Sunday at 10/9c.] Over the past year, the two men connected Mr. Giuliani with Ukrainians who were willing to participate in efforts to push a largely unsubstantiated narrative about the Bidens. They played a key role in a campaign by pro-Trump forces to press for the removal of the United States ambassador to Ukraine on the grounds that she had not shown sufficient loyalty to the president as he pursued his agenda there. They met regularly with Mr. Giuliani, often at the Trump International hotel in Washington. And all the while, they were pursuing their own business schemes and, according to an indictment unsealed on Thursday, illegally funneling campaign contributions in the United States in the service of both their political and business activities. The indictment, along with interviews and other documents, show Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and their associates as somewhat hapless operators, scrambling recklessly to use their new connections to the highest levels of American politics to seek financial gain while guiding Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, into a Ukrainian political culture rife with self-dealing and ever-shifting alliances. The indictment provided new details about the dealings of Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, as well as a pair of associates, including David Correia, who with Mr. Parnas helped found Fraud Guarantee, the fraud prevention and mitigation company that retained Mr. Giuliani. The four men were charged with campaign finance violations related to their efforts to enlist public officials in their moneymaking efforts and their political efforts in Ukraine. The indictment does not name or identify Mr. Giuliani or Mr. Trump. But it helps show how Mr. Giuliani, who was retained by Mr. Trump as a personal lawyer to fend off one challenge to his presidency \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III \u00e2\u0080\u0094 helped steer his client into another: dealings with Ukraine that are now at the heart of the impeachment inquiry by House Democrats. The congressional committees overseeing the impeachment inquiry have subpoenaed Mr. Giuliani for records related to his efforts in Ukraine, including records related to Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and Semyon Kislin, another Ukrainian-born businessman. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman had been asked to appear before House investigators this week, but declined to do so. And on Thursday, the congressional committees issued subpoenas demanding they produce documents by Wednesday, while signaling that the committees still expected the pair to testify to Congress. The two men did get something useful for their Ukrainian efforts from Pete Sessions, then a Republican member of Congress from Texas, who is not identified in the indictment. It says that after making substantial campaign donations to him, Mr. Parnas asked Mr. Sessions for help last year in pressing the Trump administration to remove the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch. Mr. Sessions subsequently wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticizing Ms. Yovanovitch and seeking to have her dismissed. Mr. Parnas had told associates that she was not open to his proposals related to the lucrative gas business in Ukraine, where Mr. Parnas pitched a natural gas deal to the chief executive of Naftogaz, as The New York Times reported last month. Ms. Yovanovitch had also come under fire from a Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who was connected to Mr. Giuliani by Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman and played a key role in Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to promote investigations into Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rivals. While the indictment did not identify any officials by name, it said that Mr. Parnas, in his effort to oust Ms. Yovanovitch, acted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Giuliani also said he provided legal advice to Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman after their efforts in Ukraine brought them into conflict with a powerful oligarch, Ihor Kolomoisky. Mr. Kolomoisky said in interviews in the Ukrainian news media that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman traveled to see him in Israel in April, ostensibly to talk about their plans to sell gas to Ukraine. But, he said, the two men then pushed him to arrange a meeting between Mr. Giuliani and Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr. Giuliani had been seeking to press Mr. Zelensky to agree to investigate the Bidens and Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in the 2016 election, and had been working with Mr. Parnas to lay the groundwork for the effort, as The Times first reported in May. Upon returning to Ukraine, Mr. Kolomoisky threatened in May to expose Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. Mr. Giuliani, in turn, posted on Twitter that the oligarch had \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefamed\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I have advised them to press charges.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also warned Mr. Zelensky not to surround himself with allies of Mr. Kolomoisky. Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and Mr. Giuliani were frequently spotted together over the past year at the Trump International hotel in Washington, and were overheard discussing politics and energy projects, including a methane initiative in Uzbekistan. Mr. Giuliani and his associates were to be paid at least $100,000 for the project, on which Mr. Parnas offered advice. The project did not pan out, Mr. Giuliani said. Mr. Parnas said in an interview last month that he and Mr. Fruman were self-financing their efforts on behalf of Mr. Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political work in Ukraine and that those \u00e2\u0080\u009chave nothing to do with our business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy only business with Giuliani was a long time ago,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and involved an insurance company that Mr. Parnas suggested he owned that Mr. Giuliani \u00e2\u0080\u009coffered some advice on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Giuliani at first seemed to acknowledge having advised Fraud Guarantee in 2018, then backtracked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t acknowledge it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fraud Guarantee, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can acknowledge I gave them substantial business advice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding that one of his companies trains institutional customers in security work, including \u00e2\u0080\u009chow to investigate crimes, from murder to terrorism to fraud.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmost of it is subdivisions of government, but every once in a while it is a private enterprise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Last month, he seemed to minimize the campaign finance issues facing Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, saying in an interview, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI referred them to a campaign finance expert, who pretty much resolved it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On Thursday, Mr. Giuliani said he did not regret working with Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman in Ukraine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have to presume they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re innocent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a lot of motives going on trying to smear people, so I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that I regret it, no. Who else would I have turned to?\u00e2\u0080\u009d In April 2018, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman incorporated a company called Global Energy Producers ostensibly as a vehicle to engage in the trade of liquefied natural gas \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a commodity American officials have long urged Ukraine to buy from the United States. In weeks, the company attracted notice in Republican finance circles with major donations to committees supporting Mr. Trump and his allies. It gave $325,000 to America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC; $50,000 to a political action committee affiliated with the Trump-endorsed candidate for Florida governor in 2018, Ron DeSantis, and $15,000 to a super PAC supporting the 2018 Senate campaign of the West Virginia attorney general, Patrick Morrisey. The donation spree prompted legal filings by a former business partner of Mr. Parnas who was trying to collect more than $510,000 from Mr. Parnas from a 2016 federal judgment.",

At a televised forum on L.G.B.T.Q. issues on Thursday, Senator Elizabeth Warren was asked to consider a hypothetical one. Suppose a supporter approached her and said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSenator, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m old-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d How would she respond? \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to assume it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a guy who said that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Warren replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to say, then just marry one woman. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m cool with that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The audience laughed and applauded. About 10 seconds passed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAssuming you can find one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Warren added, to the delight of the crowd. Viral moments are coveted in the Democratic primary race, where they can serve as a magnet for online donations and bring much-needed attention to candidates struggling to stand out in a large field. Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answer appeared likely to turn into one of those moments, even though she is hardly struggling to attract attention to her campaign, having risen in the polls to rival former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a leading contender for the Democratic nomination. A video of her response at the forum immediately drew attention on Twitter, and the Warren campaign soon shared the moment on her feed as well. Below is a transcript of the exchange: CHRIS CUOMO: You ready for another question? ELIZABETH WARREN: You bet. CUOMO: All right. Morgan Cox, real estate investment firm in Dallas, Texas. He is the chair of the Human Rights Campaign board of directors. Morgan, thank you. WARREN: All right. Hi, Morgan. MORGAN COX: Chris, thank you so much. Hi, senator, thank you for being here. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the campaign trail \u00e2\u0080\u0094 WARREN: I have been \u00e2\u0080\u0094 COX: And you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re approached \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you have been, yes. And a supporter approaches you and says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSenator, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m old-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What is your response? WARREN: Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to assume it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a guy who said that. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to say, then just marry one woman. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m cool with that.

      "content": "With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way. Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters. The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election. And Mr. Biden signaled on Thursday night that he will come into the debate fighting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of the problems I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m finding, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to be more aggressive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles. He then used a roundabout example to explain that debate time restraints don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow time for lengthy answers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen someone says, you know, you know, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Are you still beating your wife?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And, and I go, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have a long explanation,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and they say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You got 30 seconds to answer.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And you say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098No. And then, wait a minute, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099d I just say? No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not still beating my wife.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But so, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had some difficulties,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. If Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate could break in any number of directions, what may be resolved is the overall mood of Democratic primary voters, and whether they are more inclined to seek a politically cautious nominee who promises to restore normalcy in Washington, or a more confrontational standard-bearer with an ambitious and disruptive reform agenda. It is candidates in the latter category who now control the bulk of the financial might in the race, and are best positioned in most of the early primary states. Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who is not aligned in the primary, said an \u00e2\u0080\u009canti-establishment\u00e2\u0080\u009d current had plainly taken hold, with voters rewarding candidates for defying the conventional limits of political debate and \u00e2\u0080\u009cpushing boundaries in really productive ways.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She pointed not only to Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders but also to former Representative Beto O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke, who has embraced a new political identity for himself as a gun-control activist and a critic of his own party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relatively cautious platform on the issue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAcross the board, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Beto talking about assault weapons or Warren and Sanders talking about Wall Street,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Greenberg said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit does feel like there is a shift in the party that is kind of new.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Greenberg said there was still space for Mr. Biden to run a strong campaign because of the way voters perceive his values and character. Americans, she said, believe Mr. Biden \u00e2\u0080\u009ccares about people and working class people, regular people, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an insignificant asset.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet it has been Ms. Warren, rather than Mr. Biden, who has consistently gained strength. Campaigning on a message of purging corruption in Washington and restructuring the economy, Ms. Warren has closed Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead in the polls every week since the beginning of the summer and is now in a position to upset him in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote. Mr. Biden remains a strong contender for the nomination, largely because of the support he collects from African-American voters. But he has struggled for months to articulate a clear vision for the future and has relied heavily on Democratic nostalgia for the Obama administration. In recent weeks, he has been consumed in a grisly political clash with President Trump. So far, the support Mr. Biden has lost does not seem to have gone to another moderate, like Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Only Ms. Warren has been moving up in the national polls, suggesting either that Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lost supporters have defected to her camp or that they have become undecided altogether. If Ms. Warren has become the leading liberal standard-bearer, Mr. Sanders has been a steady third in national polls and his fund-raising power is likely to keep him among the most formidable competitors in the race. Yet his campaign has been grappling with the implications of Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart attack in Las Vegas last week, a medical emergency that landed him in the hospital and has kept him off the trail for days. He has sent mixed signals about his path forward, first indicating that he would scale back his campaign schedule and then defiantly reversing that suggestion. It is unclear whether Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physical condition will affect his poll numbers: He has a solid base of support nationally and few other candidates believe his core followers will be easily dislodged. There is at least a new degree of uncertainty about whether he will be in a strong position to vie for liberal Democrats who have already been migrating toward Ms. Warren. Nearly all of the candidates feel pressure to do something in the Ohio debate to stop the race from becoming a contest entirely defined by a Warren-Biden rivalry, either by inflicting direct damage on Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign or by outflanking her as an alternative to Mr. Biden. The ongoing impeachment inquiry targeting Mr. Trump has only added to the pressure on the Democratic field, since the tumult in Washington is likely to leave voters with even less time to devote to reviewing underdog options. Mr. Buttigieg in particular has been moving assertively in recent weeks to position himself as a center-left alternative to both Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, using his considerable war chest to run television ads in Iowa. Several other candidates of different ideological stripes are counting on Iowa for a breakthrough, including Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar. A wild-card joining them onstage will be a new contender, Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund investor who has spent lavishly from his personal fortune to brand himself as a reform-minded outsider. For Ms. Warren, meanwhile, the debate may help reveal whether she can consolidate her gains across the Democratic Party. On Wednesday, she campaigned in South Carolina, where she has so far struggled to gain traction with the African-American voters who largely decide the primary there. To cement her status as a front-runner, she may have to win over a range of constituencies torn between their interest in her ideas and a more cautious political calculus that draws them to Mr. Biden. One of those voters is Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former governor, Ted Strickland, the only Democrat to hold that office this century. Like many Democratic voters, Mr. Strickland, a populist with close ties to organized labor, said he saw Mr. Biden as the safer bet for the general election but found it hard to resist the appeal of Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals, most of all her plan for a new tax on vast private fortunes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think there may be something to the electability issue for Mr. Biden, in Ohio,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Strickland said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if I could just choose to put someone in the presidency \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if that was my choice alone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it would be hard for me to pass up Elizabeth Warren.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Strickland said he had spoken with Mr. Biden recently and saw him as a seasoned diplomat and a reliable \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomic progressive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Ms. Warren, he said, was gradually easing voters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reservations about her ability to go up against Mr. Trump by talking about policy issues \u00e2\u0080\u009cin ways that are easily understood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden remains a clear favorite in just one of the early states, South Carolina, and his advisers have predicted that he would fare better in larger, more diverse states that vote later in the calendar. He is counting, in particular, on older and more moderate African-American voters to hold back the party from stampeding toward a more ideological liberal candidate. In 2016, black and Latino voters helped Hillary Clinton withstand a persistent primary challenge from Mr. Sanders. Yet scattered polling in the later states has largely followed the national trend: Last week, for instance, the Public Policy Institute of California released a poll finding a statistical three-way tie in the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most populous state between Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. Mark Baldassare, president of the institute, said there was no indication in his poll that the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diversity would represent a stumbling block for candidates on the left, as Mr. Biden is hoping. The primary debates would be crucial to determining Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued momentum, he said, because voters seemed to be using them for insight into the general election. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has become kind of a proxy for: How are these candidates going to do when they stand up next to Trump?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Baldassare said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think this will be Elizabeth Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moment now, because if she is in the mix for front-runner, people are going to be testing her and seeing: How does she do? How does she do when she has to be on defense?\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

Rudy Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back-channel efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials on behalf of President Trump has helped prompt the impeachment inquiry that may tarnish both men. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a disquieting late act in Giuliani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than four decades in public life that has many people asking how a tumultuous political career that at times appeared transcendent has become a seemingly repetitive series of angry cable news appearances. Giuliani burst on the public stage as an aggressive prosecutor who used the same tactics to take down New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notorious mafia bosses as he did Wall Street\u00e2\u0080\u0099s felonious financiers. He earned top billing as a zero-tolerance mayor who cleaned up Gotham as he inflamed racial tensions. And when the city \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the country \u00e2\u0080\u0094 came under terrorist attack, he stepped into his defining role as \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mayor\u00e2\u0080\u009d by comforting the grief stricken and rallying the faithful. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Weekly\u00e2\u0080\u009d examines his career and we ask New York Times reporters who observed the former New York mayor at every turn: How did Rudy Giuliani get here?

      "subtitle": "Why are we so obsessed?",
      "author": "Vanessa Friedman",
      "content": "Hair has once again caused a political tempest in a blow dryer. This week, the Washington Times published a story saying that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had spent $80 on a haircut and $180 on color at a Washington, D.C. salon, a styling choice the newspaper presented as hypocritical, given she \u00e2\u0080\u009cregularly rails against the rich and complains about the cost of living inside the Beltway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Almost immediately, charges of sexism and superficiality began to fly online (also, a debate about the average price of a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s haircut, and how little men seem to understand the cost of certain aspects of life). Ms. Ocasio-Cortez herself tweeted out a statement, saying that Vice President Mike Pence \u00e2\u0080\u009cused *taxpayer funds* \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not personal ones \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to spend several thousand haircuts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It would be easy to dismiss this as mere distraction, except it is also the latest in a long line of hair-related controversies in the corridors of power that have surrounded both men and women. Hair is, it seems, a particularly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 well, tangled, subject. Not to mention an equal-opportunity target. Hillary Clinton acknowledged it in 2014, when she joked that the subtitle of her memoir, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHard Choices,\u00e2\u0080\u009d should be \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Scrunchie Chronicles: 112 Countries and It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Still All About My Hair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Though Mrs. Clinton is probably the most famous hair lightning rod, whether it was her chopping and changing while in the White House as first lady (seen as reflecting the opportunism of her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies), her I-don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t-care-I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m-getting-down-to-work scrunchies as secretary of state, her John Barrett styling trip while on the campaign trail (average price per cut: $600) or her postelection lank and limp blues, she is far from the only politician scrutinized. Her husband was also mocked as far back as 1993 for having a plane wait on the tarmac in Los Angeles while he received a trim from Cristophe of Beverly Hills. The New York Times reported: \u00e2\u0080\u009cQuestions about Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s runway razor cut dominated the White House news briefing today, with the communications director, George Stephanopoulos, scrambling to explain why the populist President tied up one of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s busiest airports to have his hair trimmed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John Edwards, of course, became something of a poster boy for follicular faux pas during the 2007 presidential campaign when it was revealed he had indulged in two haircuts totaling approximately $800 at a time when he was attempting to sell himself as a champion for working class Americans. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just an American obsession. In 2016, Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Hollande, then the president of France, came under fire for a reported $10,000 a month styling bill, which was seen as inappropriate for a socialist (it even got its own hashtag: #Coiffuregate). During the 2015 Canadian election, Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair, which, in its lushness, seemed to represent his youth and privilege, had its own Twitter account \u00e2\u0080\u0094 @TrudeausHair. The Economist referred to him as the \u00e2\u0080\u009chair apparent\u00e2\u0080\u009d (a reference to his father, former Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau). And he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only one under a follicular microscope: the hair of all the (all-male) candidates played a fairly public role in that election. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s singular flyaway blondness has inspired RTE, the Irish broadcaster, to write that his hair is \u00e2\u0080\u009ckey\u00e2\u0080\u009d to his \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical brand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009csymbolizing the chaotic and gaffe-prone style that charms his supporters and appals his critics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair to say hair is not just some stringy stuff on the top of our heads. According to Grant McCracken, an anthropologist and author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cBig Hair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d our hair is \u00e2\u0080\u009cour court of deliberation, the place where we contemplate who and what we are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is visible, accessible, gender-freighted. It has associations with sex, punishment, class and power. It is probably not happenstance that the United States has not elected a bald president since Dwight D. Eisenhower left office in 1961. When it comes to politics, to care too much about hair, to spend too much on it, makes one seen as superficial and vain; focused on yourself at the expense (literally sometimes) of taxpayers. Ignore it and you are sloppy and lack attention to detail. Men have traditionally used their ability to get inexpensive barber-trims as bragging rights and something of a badge of honor. In the Washington Times story, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is lauded for the fact he got his cuts at the Senate Hair Care Services in the basement of the Russell Senate Office Building for a mere $20 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 though it is acknowledged that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s haircuts there and everywhere else are cheaper than women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In turn, women have often complained about a double standard in price and scrutiny. This has only become more true in the age of Instagram, and during a White House administration where hair has played an outsize symbolic role, from the glossy, blow-dried locks of pretty much all the women in the Trump orbit (the first lady, Tiffany Trump, Vanessa Trump, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Hope Hicks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Ivanka before the bob) to the orange-hued and complicated comb-over worn by the president himself. People joke about it, but no one forgets it. Fact is, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about hair more than ever these days, not less. All of which suggests that, whether we like it or not, when it comes to politics (as when it comes to a lot of life), a trim is rarely just a trim. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a weapon, and a tool. If we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t admit that and wield it ourselves \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with humor, ideally \u00e2\u0080\u0094 then someone else will.",

      "content": "IOWA CITY \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Oliver Hanlon was beaming ear-to-ear as he stood next to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on a riverside stage at the University of Iowa. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI met the president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted, bounding down the steps two at a time. His mother gently corrected him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, while the Warren photo line snaked on behind her. Oliver couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be faulted for his civics proficiency; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 7 years old. The 2020 Democratic presidential campaign stops are crawling with children, some of whom spend most of the stump speeches crawling away from their parents. While all of the candidates seek to portray a family-friendly image, it takes work to bring a youngster to a campaign event: They often start late and run well into the evening, with a policy discussion not exactly accessible on the elementary-school level; bigger rallies often take place outdoors, regardless of weather. Kissing babies and tousling children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair has long been a staple of retail campaigning, but in 2020 it is about more than a photo op, even the cutest of photo ops. In a historically crowded field, in an era of uncertain polling, these campaign stops are something of a past-their-bedtimes straw poll, revealing which candidates young parents deem viable or famous enough to risk a tantrum or a sleep-deprived meltdown over the next morning. For now, the leaders appear to be Ms. Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who have both taken steps to cater to the children and parents who come see them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one more subtle measure of their stature in race that is steadily narrowing from the largest primary field in history to just a handful of viable contenders. Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden, whose staffs both go to great lengths to present their events as family friendly, are currently atop the Democratic polls, which might explain the pep talk parents often give their children before meeting the two candidates: You are talking to the next president. Ms. Warren lets families with children cut to the front of her selfie line, a strong incentive given that supporters often wait hours for a 20-second interaction and photograph. Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign stops over the summer and fall have often come with free ice cream \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and if frozen dairy products are not available, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been known to hand out cash with instructions for children to tell their parents to stop for a treat on the way home. During a Labor Day swing through Iowa, Mr. Biden worked a chocolate-and-vanilla swirl machine at one union picnic and handed out ice cream sandwiches at another. Last month in Iowa City, Clara Engler, 5, spent hours before an evening Warren rally at the University of Iowa practicing the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpinkie promise\u00e2\u0080\u009d that has become a staple for young girls at Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s events. With her mother, Brooke Engler, an Iowa City cosmetologist, Clara worked on locking fingers briefly and looking up, so she could hear Ms. Warren tell her that running for president is \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat girls do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When the moment came, about a half-hour after Clara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bedtime, Ms. Warren got down on one knee, looked her in the eye and made the promise. Clara jumped up with glee. Her mother beamed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d seen it before on TV,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Engler said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice that I can have my child sit back and watch politics without worrying about what will be said.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The others in the 19-candidate Democratic field aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t overtly inhospitable to children, but former Representative Beto O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke of Texas peppers his stump speech with profanity and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a fuzzy figure while delivering his policy-heavy stemwinders. In early September he scolded a crying baby to \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep it down\u00e2\u0080\u009d during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose most fervent supporters tend to be young enough not to have children of their own, often attracts older kids \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly L.G.B.T. teens inspired by the first openly gay major candidate for president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you know that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something historic about your campaign, you feel a level of responsibility that goes with that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Buttigieg said aboard his Iowa campaign bus last month. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt certainly adds a level of motivation when people come up to you, sometimes with tears in their eyes, just letting you know what the fact of your campaign means to them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even in Iowa, where rare is the weekend without a presidential hopeful stumping nearby, it takes a serious commitment and coordination to attend a campaign event with young children. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she starts crying we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll run out quickly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Elizabeth Batey, a lawyer from Waverly, Iowa, said of her 2-year-old daughter, Hattie, while waiting for Mr. Buttigieg last month in a stuffy storefront in Iowa Falls. Ms. Batey, whose 4-month-old son, George, was asleep in his car seat, made it through Mr. Buttigieg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event without having to flee. Afterward, she waited on the sidewalk in front of the Buttigieg campaign bus, holding one child in each arm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWow, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got your hands full,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Buttigieg told her before pausing for a picture. Parents interviewed at a range of campaign events said they often felt like this political moment resembled a tawdry reality TV show, and they brought their children to see the 2020 candidates to try to demonstrate to them that politics can be something different. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let my kids listen to the TV without being ready to hit the mute button,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Julia Privett, a physician assistant who brought her 2-year-old daughter, Alyssa, to see Mr. Biden talk about climate change in Cedar Rapids. Lytishya Borglum, a Cedar Falls small business owner, brought her three middle-school-aged children to see Senator Kamala Harris of California speak at the University of Northern Iowa. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d taken her oldest daughter, 13-year-old Berlyn, to see Democratic caucus campaign events in 2008, but skipped 2016 because it was too toxic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNowadays, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible for them not to be exposed to the craziness in the White House,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Borglum said. At Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Iowa City rally, a parade of children waited with their parents for a picture with the senator. Kohner Reynolds, who will turn 2 in November, blew past his 7:30 p.m. bedtime. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe fell asleep a couple times in the baby carrier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kohner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother, Callie Reynolds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted him to be able to say he came to see her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Burgundy Johnson, a child psychologist, kept her 5-month-old son, Archer, up past his 8 o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock bedtime. She occupied Archer with toys. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted a picture of Elizabeth Warren holding my baby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said while leaving the event at 8:40 p.m. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be an interesting night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The older children tend to be more attuned to issues. Evelynn Parlet, 11, an Iowa City sixth grader, said she approved of Ms. Warren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign goal of reordering the American economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI liked what she said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to help people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Samara and Isa Murillo, sisters who are 10 and 8 years old, each had Ms. Warren autograph a white campaign placard. Ms. Warren got down on one knee and signed them on the floor of the stage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe love her ideas about change and the two cents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Samara said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople out there are dying of hunger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Isa said she was more focused on climate change. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have homes because of the flooding,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. And, because it is Iowa, there are parents who spend caucus season vying to get their children photographed with all of the candidates they can \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just in case one of them makes it to the White House. Eric Heininger, a fund-raiser for nonprofit organizations, and his wife, Tiffani Milless, a physician, toted their 9-month-old daughter, Charlotte, around the Polk County Steak Fry last month to get her in pictures with as many contenders as possible. Dressed in a red-white-and-blue sundress, Charlotte met Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang. At earlier campaign events, she was photographed with Mr. Sanders, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, who ended his campaign in August. With Charlotte sleeping on her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest, Dr. Milless filled out a card committing to caucus for Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke and held it up while the Texan offered his toothy smile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you so much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke said, gently patting the sleeping child on her back. A campaign aide took Dr. Milless\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caucus card and stuffed it into a backpack. Afterward, Dr. Milless said she had only filled out the card in order to secure the picture with her daughter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in my top three,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a loose commitment, kind of like a promise ring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump said Friday that the United States had reached an interim deal with China that would forestall a tariff increase slated for next week, providing a temporary d\u00c3\u00a9tente in a prolonged and economically painful trade war. Mr. Trump, speaking from the Oval Office, said negotiators had reached a \u00e2\u0080\u009cPhase 1\u00e2\u0080\u009d agreement that would take several weeks to write and that both sides could officially sign by November. If completed, the agreement would provide relief to American farmers and businesses that have been battered by the trade war. Mr. Trump said the \u00e2\u0080\u009csubstantial\u00e2\u0080\u009d agreement would involve China buying $40 billion to $50 billion worth of American agricultural products annually, along with guidelines on how it manages its currency, the renminbi. It would also strengthen Chinese protections for American intellectual property and give financial services companies more access to China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market, the president said. In exchange, the United States will not move ahead next week with plans to raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30 percent. The president has not made a final decision on whether to impose an additional round of tariffs on Dec. 15, as he has threatened. The announcement is a sharp turn from Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s posture several weeks ago, when the president \u00e2\u0080\u0094 angry over China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retaliatory tariffs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 demanded that American companies stop doing business with China and threatened to tax every toy, shoe and computer from Beijing before the year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end. The escalation has rattled investors, lawmakers and businesses, which have begun delaying investment and hiring amid continuing uncertainty about the trade war\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trajectory. The economic pain appears to have softened Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appetite for a fight. On Friday, the president said the two sides would now work on a deal in phases, a reversal from his previous position that he was looking for a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplete\u00e2\u0080\u009d China deal, not an interim agreement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a big deal that doing it in sections, in phases, is really better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said during a White House meeting with Liu He, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice premier. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll either have two phases or three phases.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The first phase could be signed when Mr. Trump appears alongside Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, at a meeting of global leaders in Santiago, Chile, in November. The next phase would begin soon after, Mr. Trump said. Despite the announcement, the deal has not been completed, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that more work remained, including on the agreements related to currency and access for American financial companies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a fundamental agreement on the key issues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there is a significant amount of work to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The deal is far from the type of comprehensive agreement Mr. Trump has been pushing for, and it leaves some of the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest concerns about China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic practices unresolved. Although exact terms are still under discussion, the details the president announced include some of the concessions that China has previously floated, including purchases of agricultural products and limits on Beijing devaluing its currency to gain a competitive advantage. Still, the agreement, which came during the 13th round of negotiations, will help to defuse trade tensions that have begun inflicting pain on the global economy and bolster business across the Pacific. In his quest to force China to acquiesce to America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terms, Mr. Trump has already taxed $360 billion worth of Chinese products and had penciled in another round of tariffs on Dec. 15. Stock and commodity prices climbed on Friday as investors anticipated a resolution to the trade spat. The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 1.3 percent. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks, typically viewed as closely tied to the health of the American domestic economy, rose 1.8 percent. Crude oil prices rose, as did prices for key industrial metals such as copper and iron ore, often looked to as a barometer of the outlook for China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large industrial economy. Stocks of companies with heavy exposure to China soared. Shares of Deere & Company rose 1.9 percent, while Apple gained 2.7 percent and Wynn Resorts, which generates the bulk of its revenue from casinos in China, surged 6.3 percent. An index of semiconductor companies, which depend on Asian supply chains, gained 2.3 percent. Business groups expressed relief that the negotiations between the United States and China appeared to be making progress after more than a year of sputtering, yet they acknowledged that the agreement fell short of the sweeping deal that Mr. Trump had promised. John Neuffer, the president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said the deal was \u00e2\u0080\u009cwelcome news\u00e2\u0080\u009d for his industry that would give \u00e2\u0080\u009cboth sides a chance to get back to the negotiating table to strike a more comprehensive deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The initial reaction among Republican lawmakers was cautiously optimistic. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Finance Committee, said that any progress was good news, but that Mr. Trump must reach a more substantial deal for the pain of the trade war to have been worthwhile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter so much has been sacrificed, Americans will settle for nothing less than a full, enforceable and fair deal with China,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Grassley said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI look forward to learning more details in the coming days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trade experts in China were quick to welcome the deal as a breakthrough. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt the first time since the start of the trade war that negotiators have reached some solid result,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cui Fan, a prominent professor of trade policy at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defenders say China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concessions will generate positive momentum for future talks and result in more business for farmers and manufacturers as they continue to press Beijing for a broader pact to correct longstanding economic abuses. Critics say that the move will go only part way toward resolving a crisis of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own making, and that the trade war will continue to slow the global economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBehind the hype, this is nothing more than a partial and ostensibly unsustainable deal lacking in real enforcement mechanism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gregory Daco, the chief United States economist at Oxford Economics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor businesses, this will mean less damage, not greater certainty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The interim agreement also does not resolve some of the thorniest issues between the two countries, including whether the United States will continue to label China a currency manipulator and whether it will keep Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, on a government blacklist. In August, the Treasury Department formally designated China a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994, at the direction of Mr. Trump. The largely symbolic move came amid frustration among American officials that China was counteracting the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tariffs by devaluing the renminbi. Mr. Mnuchin said that the United States would decide whether to rescind the designation in a future phase of negotiations. And Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top trade negotiator, said the deal did not resolve the fate of Huawei, which is banned from buying American products \u00e2\u0080\u0094 much to China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dismay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this agreement we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not dealing specifically with Huawei,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not part of this agreement. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a separate process.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump and his advisers also did not mention any progress in areas that the American business community has identified as critical to its ability to compete with Chinese companies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subsidization of industries, the role of the government in the economy and the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s restrictions on transfers of data across its borders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur hope and our aspiration is that they get to those harder issues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Myron Brilliant, the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Still, he added that the steps taken this week might create positive momentum toward addressing those issues. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had nothing but bad news since May in the U.S.-China relationship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Brilliant said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now we seemed to have put a halt to a further escalation of tensions, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a step in the right direction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Lighthizer said that the deal would require China to make structural changes to how it screened food imports and approved new genetically modified products that would allow more American farm goods to flow there. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be much easier now for American farmers to be able to ship to China,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made some changes on our side too that will help the Chinese.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The agreement came after Chinese officials shifted their position on the trade talks over the past month, moving from an insistence on a complete removal of American tariffs to a willingness to accept a partial deal that would leave many of those tariffs in place. One important factor in China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shifting stance involved a severe yet unexpected problem: a genuine need for food imports from the United States. African swine fever has killed an estimated two fifths of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pig herd over the past year, producing a sharp increase in pork prices. The need for increased food imports from the United States persuaded the Chinese that both sides could benefit from a partial deal even if it did not involve complete elimination of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new tariffs, a person familiar with the talks said. Mr. Trump acknowledged that tensions with China had spiraled as a result of the trade war but said that relations between the two countries were now \u00e2\u0080\u009ca love fest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cTalk was getting tough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the president said, adding that both sides had \u00e2\u0080\u009cplanes\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cships\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that \u00e2\u0080\u009cstupid things can happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "The estate of Prince, the musician who died in 2016, pushed back against President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign on Thursday night after the artist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s song \u00e2\u0080\u009cPurple Rain\u00e2\u0080\u009d was played at a Trump rally that night in Minneapolis, the singer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hometown. On a Twitter account set up to celebrate the life of the singer, the estate said that Jones Day, the law firm that has represented Mr. Trump in election law matters and continuing lawsuits, had agreed last October that the campaign would not use Prince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s songs at rallies and other events. The estate posted a letter it said it had received from Jones Day last year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout admitting liability, and to avoid any future dispute, we write to confirm that the Campaign will not use Prince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s music in connection with its activities going forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter said. The estate said on Twitter that despite that understanding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPurple Rain\u00e2\u0080\u009d had been played at the Minneapolis rally. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Prince Estate will never give permission to President Trump to use Prince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s songs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it said. A representative for Jones Day was not immediately available for comment on Friday. Other artists have asked the Trump campaign not to use their music, including Rihanna and Axl Rose, and the wording in the Jones Day letter resembled one also sent to representatives of Steven Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith, who had objected to the playing of his music at Trump events. Such requests are not unusual for politicians and the arenas where they drum up support. Usually, music rights agencies advise campaigns to buy blanket licenses so they can play music in the agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 catalogs wherever they are. Arenas where politicians appear often have a blanket license that allows the venue to play any song in an agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s catalog. Sometimes artists find that their music has slipped through into an event for a politician they do not support. In 2018, Pharrell Williams sent a letter to the president after the song \u00e2\u0080\u009cHappy\u00e2\u0080\u009d was played at an event on the day of the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh. But the group that hosted the event, the National FFA (Future Farmers of America) Organization, said its organist had played the song without any input from the campaign, The New York Times reported.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accounting firm must comply with a House committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demands for eight years of his financial records, a federal appeals court panel ruled on Friday in a major victory for House Democrats in their struggle against his vow to stonewall \u00e2\u0080\u009call\u00e2\u0080\u009d of their oversight subpoenas. In a 66-page ruling, the panel rejected Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument that Congress had no legitimate legislative authority to seek his business records from the firm, Mazars USA, because the committee was trying to determine whether he broke existing laws \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not weighing whether to enact a new one. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving considered the weighty issues at stake in this case, we conclude that the subpoena issued by the committee to Mazars is valid and enforceable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Judge David S. Tatel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Mr. Trump is virtually certain to appeal the ruling, either to the full Court of Appeals or to the Supreme Court. But the decision \u00e2\u0080\u0094 affirming an earlier ruling by a Federal District Court judge \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was the first test at the appeals court level of the Trump legal team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sweeping challenges to the constitutional authority of Congress to conduct oversight of his activities. Judge Tatel was joined by Judge Patricia A. Millett in the majority of the three-judge ruling. Both were appointed by Democratic presidents. Judge Neomi Rao, a former Trump administration official whom Mr. Trump appointed to the bench in March, dissented, saying she would have quashed the subpoena as exceeding the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legislative powers. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the Democratic chairman of the oversight committee, hailed the appeals court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruling is a fundamental and resounding victory for congressional oversight, our constitutional system of checks and balances and the rule of law,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor far too long, the president has placed his personal interests over the interests of the American people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lawyers for Mr. Trump were reviewing the decision, said one, Jay Sekulow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe continue to believe that this subpoena is not a legitimate exercise of Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legislative authority,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Sarah E. Sutton, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined to comment on the ruling. The scope of Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power to compel the production of information \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power to keep information secret \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has emerged as a recurring battleground between House Democrats and Mr. Trump, whose legal team has put forth novel legal arguments in carrying out his vow to systematically defy House subpoenas. This week, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, sent a letter to the House declaring that the administration would not cooperate with the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impeachment inquiry, such as by providing documents or permitting witnesses to testify. The Trump legal team has separately argued that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current and former White House aides are absolutely immune from subpoenas for their testimony \u00e2\u0080\u0094 meaning they would not even have to show up \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that Congress lacks legitimate legislative authority to scrutinize potential wrongdoing in the executive branch. The appeals court ruling on Friday centered on that third argument, and it was in some respects already obsolete because the premise of the argument was that the House was relying only on its routine legislative and oversight authorities, rather than any extra investigative powers that lawmakers gain when engaged in an impeachment inquiry. But since the Mazars case started going through the courts, the House Judiciary Committee and Speaker Nancy Pelosi have declared that the chamber is conducting an impeachment inquiry. The Trump administration has disputed that premise, since the full House has not voted for a resolution approving such an investigation. Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruling did not address the question of whether an impeachment inquiry is underway \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, if so, whether that matters. The majority on the panel ruled for the House without any need to invoke its impeachment powers. Specifically, the fight centered on whether the House Oversight and Reform Committee had the authority to compel Mazars to turn over Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial records as part of its routine legislative and oversight powers, even if the committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purpose was in part to determine whether Mr. Trump committed crimes. The committee, led by Mr. Cummings, issued the subpoena after it came to light that Mr. Trump had failed to list on his ethics disclosure forms a debt that he owed and then repaid to his former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, for paying hush money to a pornographic actress just before the 2016 election to keep quiet about an affair she claimed to have had with Mr. Trump. He has denied the relationship. Mr. Cohen also testified before Congress that Mr. Trump routinely changed the value of his assets for different financial purposes, like inflating their value for loan applications but deflating them for taxes. (Mr. Cohen was separately convicted of lying to Congress in earlier testimony.) In making the request for documents and then issuing the subpoena, Mr. Cummings said that Congress was trying to determine whether the president had broken laws, but he also said that lawmakers were trying to decide whether to update financial disclosure laws. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal team, which sued Mazars to obtain a court order blocking it from complying with the subpoena, argued that this meant the committee was effectively trying to carry out a criminal investigation. That, they asserted, was an executive branch job, not a legislative one, and so the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subpoena was invalid. But Judge Tatel wrote that Supreme Court precedent granted broad authority to Congress to issue subpoenas for information that could be used to enact new laws \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even if it could also be useful as criminal evidence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and imposed no requirement on lawmakers to say that legislation was their specific purpose. In any case, he also wrote, Mr. Cummings had made reference to investigating whether new legislation was necessary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe conclude that the public record reveals legitimate legislative pursuits, not an impermissible law enforcement purpose, behind the committee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subpoena,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. Judge Rao disagreed. Lawyers for the House, led by their counsel Douglas Letter, had relied only on the House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s normal oversight powers in support of the subpoena, she noted, arguing that permitting lawmakers to pursue such information without an impeachment inquiry would make it too easy to harass the presidency. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the House chooses to investigate the president for alleged violations of the laws and the Constitution, it must proceed through impeachment, an exceptional and solemn exercise of judicial power established as a separate check on public officials,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote. But Judge Rao did not address the House Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 more recent assertions that they are, in fact, already conducting an impeachment inquiry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 nor the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claims that there is no such inquiry for legal purposes. In a letter to Democrats celebrating the ruling, Ms. Pelosi wrote: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions threaten our national security, violate our Constitution and undermine the integrity of our elections. No one is above the law. The president will be held accountable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election. After next week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic debate, pundits will inevitably argue over who won and who lost, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll scour the polls to see if any presidential candidate has gotten a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbump\u00e2\u0080\u009d in support. But as high-profile as they are, debates rarely help a candidate break out of a crowded field. And strategists generally agree that post-debate spikes in the polls seldom last for long. A dozen candidates will be onstage at the CNN/New York Times debate on Tuesday, but experts broadly agree that none of them are likely to see a significant change in fortunes in a single night. Ahead of the 2016 Republican primaries, Donald J. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s publicity-heavy campaign rolled along with impregnable strength, despite the fact that TV viewers rarely gave him high marks for his debate performances. The current Democratic race has been characterized by a similar steadiness, experts say, with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. continuing to command the support of around a quarter of Democratic respondents, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts rising consistently and sometimes surpassing him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDemocratic primary voters basically seem to be fine with their top three options,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sean McElwee, a co-founder of the polling and analytics firm Data for Progress, referring to Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the possibility that a debate would drive a news cycle that would bolster a candidate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. McElwee added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut instead, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen is that those sorts of moments tend to fall off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senator Kamala Harris of California is the only Democratic candidate this cycle who has seen a statistically significant jolt in the polls after a debate. At the first round of Democratic debates in late June, she confronted Mr. Biden on his past opposition to federally mandated school busing. She immediately leapt up in the polls, enjoying double-digit support among primary voters nationwide throughout July. Perhaps more important, the exchange gave her fund-raising operation a shot of adrenaline: Just 24 hours after the debate, she had raised $2 million. But she soon fell from the race\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top tier, and has not broken into the double digits in any major national poll since the start of August. Mr. McElwee cited recent studies showing that candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 success is strongly driven by the sheer amount of news coverage they manage to receive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an argument that was borne out by the success of Mr. Trump in the run-up to the 2016 primaries, when he was able to reverse the unfavorable opinions that most Republican voters held of him, not by changing the tenor of his campaign, but by securing almost nonstop coverage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are lots of different earned-media opportunities in the current climate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and debates are very important,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. McElwee said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if you look at the polling, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been lots of people who have had good debates, bad debates, and at the end of the day, it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really changed the broad structure of the race.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the broad scope of cable news coverage, the one hit per month of the debate is not enough to make a candidate break through,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. The Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said that debates can help drive future coverage, resulting in a snowball effect. But she added that candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fortunes will largely be determined on the ground in early-voting states. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that honestly, the debates are having more impact on news coverage than they are having impact on voters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Lake said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCandidates don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get known by unveiling a good plan at the debate. They become known by immersing themselves in these early states.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To qualify for November\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate, candidates will need to reach 5 percent support in two polls in early nominating states, or 3 percent in four early-state or national polls. These are higher thresholds than for any debate thus far. A bump after next week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate could, at the very least, help candidates such as Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota or the former housing secretary Juli\u00c3\u00a1n Castro \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who are now foundering in the low single digits \u00e2\u0080\u0094 secure a spot onstage next month. But historically, early debates have been more likely to disqualify a candidate than to provide a lasting jolt of momentum. In 2011, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas pledged in an early debate to eliminate three agencies from the executive branch if elected president but couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember the name of one of the agencies. He never recovered from the flub. (When Mr. Trump became president, however, Mr. Perry was chosen to head the Department of Energy, the very agency he had forgotten to name.) Last election cycle, the businesswoman Carly Fiorina enjoyed a strong showing in the second Republican primary debate, seeing a sizable uptick in support in the days afterward. But she could not convert it into a consistent climb in the polls. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuccessful first debate performances create buzz for a candidate but also generate expectations for continued success,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the historian and presidential scholar Bruce Buchanan wrote in an email. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he or she does O.K. but less well in the second debate, the story is about underperformance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist and speechwriter, said that Ms. Warren had found success by performing strongly in debates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while not chasing a breakout moment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has done this by performing consistently well by not looking for a cute line, and my guess is that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. But Mr. Shrum noted that as the field of candidates narrows, and the remaining candidates each get more airtime, the opportunity for news-making moments will increase. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese early debates are more like skirmishes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now getting into the later debates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and they can have an impact.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It may not be until the general election that the debate stage once again assumes prime importance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrimary debates are more like a beauty contest or a cameo appearance in a play,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peter Hart, a longtime Democratic pollster, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt gives you a glimpse, it gives you an insight, and it allows a candidate to get noticed. More importantly, it can eliminate a candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential to be the nominee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On the other hand, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgeneral election debates have a huge impact upon the dynamics of the election \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the outcome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "Public support for impeaching President Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and also for removing him from office \u00e2\u0080\u0094 surged after Nancy Pelosi announced the House impeachment inquiry more than two weeks ago. For now, that support hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reached the point where one might expect Republican members of Congress to feel substantial political pressure to turn on the president. And while Democrats hope support for impeachment has room for growth, there is not yet conclusive evidence that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still increasing. But the change in public opinion is more than enough for Democrats to avoid the most negative political consequences that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve long feared from pursuing impeachment. Many polls showing lopsided support for impeachment focus on the impeachment inquiry itself, including one this week from the Washington Post/George Mason University that showed adults supporting the inquiry by a 20-point margin, 58 percent to 38 percent. The high level of support suggests that, at least for now, Democrats are on firm political ground in examining Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to have Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president investigate a political rival\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family. Many voters seem to be taking the allegations against Mr. Trump seriously, and they may eventually determine that his conduct merits removal from office. But for now, many of the voters who support an inquiry have not reached that conclusion. Polls asking whether voters support impeaching Mr. Trump and removing him from office show far more mixed results. The same Washington Post/George Mason University survey found that 49 percent supported removing Mr. Trump from office, while 44 percent opposed. And other recent polls, including one from NBC/WSJ, suggest that fewer Americans support impeaching and removing the president than not. Question wording, question order or even the timing of the survey in a rapidly unfolding news environment could explain the differences. On average, voters appear to support impeaching and removing the president by a narrow margin, 47 percent to 44 percent, in polls conducted over the last 10 days. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to say what level of political support for impeachment might begin to change the political calculus for members of Congress. There are very few precedents for impeachment, and the factual merits of the case against the president could be just as important as the politics. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to say that the current political environment will not do much to pressure Republicans. Since the Pelosi announcement, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval rating has slumped to 42.8 percent from 44.3 percent among likely or registered voters, according to FiveThirtyEight. But this merely brings his ratings back to where they were on Sept. 10, and well within the normal range for the president since the end of the government shutdown in January. Support for impeachment and removal has increased to about the level of opposition to Brett Kavanaugh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Supreme Court nomination; he wound up winning all but unanimous support from Senate Republicans. And there is limited evidence that support for impeachment and removal continues to increase. That may be surprising, given flashy headlines showing substantial increases in support. But those results are mainly being compared with those taken before the inquiry was announced. It is not obvious that the most recent polls are much worse for the president than those taken a week or two ago. Four pollsters have conducted two surveys since the announcement of the inquiry (HarrisX, YouGov, Morning Consult and Quinnipiac), and on average they show support for impeachment creeping up \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from plus-4 to plus-5 over an average of 10 days between the initial and second survey. In other words, it is possible that impeachment support quickly rose as Democrats got on board, but has not necessarily increased much since. Data from Civiqs, an online firm, shows a similar trend, with support for impeachment growing by a net of one percentage point since an initial post-inquiry bounce. The higher level of support for the impeachment inquiry can give Democrats hope that there are many voters, including many Republicans, who might be open to reaching a verdict against the president. The Watergate scandal is often cited as a favorable precedent for the Democrats in this regard. Support for impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon tended to grow during that investigation. It is far too soon to say whether a similar story will play out for President Trump.",

      "content": "The nonpartisan commission that governs presidential debates announced on Friday the dates and sites for the three presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate during the 2020 general election. All four debates will be held at universities, as has been recent custom. The presidential debates will kick off Sept. 29 at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, according to the Commission on Presidential Debates. (The campus is adjacent to South Bend, Ind., where Pete Buttigieg, one of the candidates for the Democratic nomination, is mayor.) The others will be held Oct. 15 at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Oct. 22 at Belmont University in Nashville. The lone vice-presidential debate is scheduled for Oct. 7 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.  President Trump won Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee and Utah in 2016, three of them handily. In Michigan, which will most likely be a battleground state in 2020, he beat Hillary Clinton by fewer than 11,000 votes. The debates will run for 90 minutes without commercial interruption, the commission said. The moderators and format will be announced later. The commission has sponsored and produced the general election debates since the 1988 campaign. Not only do general election debates attract more viewers than any other campaign event; historically, these matchups have ranked among television\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most-watched broadcasts, political or otherwise. In 2016, the first debate between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton was seen by 84 million live television viewers, the biggest audience since television debates started in 1960. Roughly 18 million people watched the first Democratic presidential debate this year on live television, a record for a Democratic primary matchup. The next Democratic primary debate, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, is scheduled for this Tuesday night.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The Trump administration on Friday belatedly threatened new sanctions against Turkey that officials said could cripple Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy in response to its military offensive against Kurds in northern Syria. President Trump will sign an executive order giving the Treasury Department new powers to punish Turkish government officials if Turkey targets ethnic and religious minorities in its operations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which are specifically aimed at Kurdish fighters. The White House also warned that if Turkey allowed any Islamic State fighters being held in prisons in the area to escape, the United States would respond forcefully. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can shut down the Turkish economy if we need to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said in a briefing at the White House, echoing a threat that Mr. Trump briefly made, and then retreated from, this week on Twitter. But the warning was, so far, just talk: Administration officials said they were not yet moving ahead with any new sanctions against Turkey, and left unclear what kind of actions might prompt enforcement of the threat. Some American diplomats said they viewed the warning as an effort to pre-empt congressional sanctions. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to remove American forces from the region in advance of the Turkish offensive has been met with condemnation from both parties in Congress, including from some of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staunchest supporters. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, denounced the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move as a betrayal of American allies; so did Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who declared that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe ability to recruit partners to fight radical Islam in the future has been virtually destroyed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d White House officials say they are concerned that lawmakers are moving forward with bipartisan sanctions legislation, which could have enough votes to override a presidential veto. That happened in 2017, involving sanctions on Russia. It was the timing of Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s threat, more than the substance, that seemed particularly mysterious. In the days since President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke with Mr. Trump by telephone about pulling American troops out of Syria, several senior American diplomats have said that Mr. Trump made a crucial error by not threatening sanctions before the withdrawal. By doing so after the fact, Mr. Erdogan would lose face if he changed course in response to such a warning. Nonetheless, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in an interview with The Tennessean during a visit to Nashville, seemed to be trying to contain the damage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made very clear, both publicly and directly to Turkey as well as through State Department channels, that there will be a real cost to Turkey, to President Erdogan, if he continues down this path; that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be an economic cost,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the Kurdish people here and the leadership in Turkey should understand that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think what President Erdogan did was right. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not proper, and he needs to stop.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Mnuchin said that he did not believe that the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions led to the current situation in the region. Mr. Trump had told the Turkish president that American troops fighting alongside the Kurds in a counterterrorism mission against the Islamic State would be pulled back from the border with Syria, which critics of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy said effectively gave the Turks permission to start their offensive. The executive order will give Treasury the authority to impose secondary sanctions against anyone engaging in \u00e2\u0080\u009cknowing and significant transactions\u00e2\u0080\u009d with designated individuals and entities of Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government. Mr. Mnuchin said that banks should be prepared for potential sanctions actions by the United States. A senior State Department official said sanctions were likely to be similar to economic penalties that were imposed in 2018 against the Turkish justice minister and interior minister. Those sanctions were meant to punish Mr. Erdogan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government for detaining an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, on charges of espionage.",

      "subtitle": "Staff Sgt. Alex Conrad, 26, died from wounds he received during a militant attack on a small outpost in Somalia.",
      "author": "Thomas Gibbons-Neff",
      "content": "A complex and difficult medical procedure that ultimately failed might have contributed to the death of an American Special Forces soldier killed last year in a firefight in Somalia, according to an investigation into the episode obtained by The New York Times. The redacted Army investigation illustrates the intense violence that can accompany the Pentagon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quiet \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrain, advise and assist\u00e2\u0080\u009d missions in distant corners of the globe, and the limitations of the American military despite its ambitious reach, vast resources and extensive training. Staff Sgt. Alex Conrad, 26, died from wounds he received during an attack on June 8, 2018, at a small outpost near the town of Jamaame, about 200 miles southwest of Mogadishu, the capital. He was hit with shrapnel from a mortar round, peppering his face, neck, stomach and legs, starting an hourlong effort to save his life. Three other Americans and a Somali soldier were wounded in the attack by militants from al Shabab. The investigation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s documents also highlight the disparity in resources between different countries overseen by the American military command in Africa. Failures from the Oct. 4, 2017, ambush in Niger that left four American soldiers and five Nigeriens dead pointed to a lack of medical evacuation support, overhead surveillance and intelligence about their enemy. But despite the influx of resources in Somalia, where troops there had medical helicopters minutes away and drones orbiting above them, the Shabab militants still managed to organize a rapid and deadly attack that killed Sergeant Conrad before they quickly disappeared back into the underbrush without detection. Around 2:45 that afternoon, minutes after small-arms fire was directed at the American and Somali outpost, mortar fire landed within the position. The firefight was fast and intense. The blasts from the mortars immediately wounded Sergeant Conrad and the three other Americans. As the Americans scurried to tend to the wounded, Sergeant Conrad complained about the pain from the injury in his left leg, the documents say. Although he was still alert, blood from the wound in his jaw was slowly suffocating him. Ultimately, the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medic performed a surgical cricothyrotomy, in which he would cut into Sergeant Conrad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at his cricoid membrane \u00e2\u0080\u0094 before inserting a tube that would allow unobstructed air to flow into his lungs. The medic, whose name was redacted in the report, noted the spot with a marker before making a vertical, then horizontal, incision. Sergeant Conrad twice dislodged the tube, labeled in the report as a Shiley tube. The team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medic tried at least once to make his initial incision longer in an effort to open the newly made airway. Sergeant Conrad was still breathing when he was loaded in a truck to rush him to the landing zone. Two HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters, crewed by elite Air Force pararescue medics, were racing from a larger American base outside the town of Kismayo, roughly 40 miles away. The helicopters arrived about 15 minutes after the Americans called for the medical evacuation. Three of the wounded Americans, including Sergeant Conrad, were loaded onto one of the Pave Hawks, where those aboard began their own assessment. One of the pararescue team members started using a bag valve mask to push air into a newly inserted tube that was placed in the same incision made by the Green Beret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medic. The Air Force medic noted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe compression of the bag valve mask had become more difficult.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At around 3:15, the flight arrived back at Kismayo, where a surgical team was waiting. Sergeant Conrad was pronounced dead about 15 minutes later. The investigation found that \u00e2\u0080\u009calthough fully qualified medical personnel made multiple attempts to establish an airway via surgical cricothyrotomy\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Sergeant Conrad \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter he received his injuries, no incision was made through the tissue plane into his airway. This might have contributed to SSG Conrad succumbing to his injuries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To be sure, a cricothyrotomy in a combat zone is fraught with hazard and is often a last-ditch effort to help someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breathing. Even in a controlled environment, such as a hospital, the procedure is extremely challenging. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe attempted procedure under the conditions that existed on June 8, 2018, was extraordinary in itself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the report says. An addendum to the investigation stated that the Special Operations Command that oversees operations in Africa, and subsequent units, had already moved to review medical training related to the procedure. Ultimately, the investigating officer concluded that no \u00e2\u0080\u009cindividual, unit or organization acted in a negligent manner\u00e2\u0080\u009d during the operation and ensuing medical care. The American military\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Africa Command had no immediate comment on the investigation. The Green Beret team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission on June 8, alongside their Somali counterparts, was to push into Shabab-held territory, where the militants had been instigating attacks from, and build the small base that would later be renamed after Sergeant Conrad. Sergeant Conrad, from Chandler, Ariz., joined the Army in 2010 and was trained to interact with local populations to glean information about militant groups. He had been to Afghanistan twice before finding himself attached to a Green Beret team from Third Special Forces Group in Somalia. When he was killed, his team had less than a month left on their deployment. He was posthumously awarded a Bronze Star with valor for running out in the early minutes of the firefight on June 8 and ushering a civilian linguist to safety. The Shabab, an extremist group that has long tried to overthrow Somalia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Western-backed government, has lost much of the territory it once controlled, but Pentagon officials fear the group still might be growing in Somalia and elsewhere in East Africa. Last month, Shabaab militants attacked a Somali air base used by American forces with multiple car bombs, injuring civilians there. About 500 American troops are in Somalia, and they are mostly Special Operations units. Last year, after a broad review under Jim Mattis, the defense secretary at the time, the Pentagon announced that it was reducing the number of troops on the continent. In 2017, a member of the Navy SEALs, Senior Chief Petty Officer Kyle Milliken, was killed and two other American troops were wounded in a raid 40 miles west of Mogadishu. The focus on providing emergency medical care to wounded troops in what is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe golden hour\u00e2\u0080\u009d has long been a concern of Defense Department officials, especially during the height of combat in the wars that followed the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. As defense secretary in 2009, Robert M. Gates became concerned that the rugged terrain and vast distances of the Afghanistan war zone were keeping wounded troops from reaching hospital care within 60 minutes. Mr. Gates ordered more helicopters to Afghanistan to evacuate wounded troops, and directed that helicopters previously set aside for rescuing downed pilots be reassigned to medical evacuation. Mr. Gates also increased the number of field hospitals. A peer-reviewed medical study published in 2015 found that those initiatives saved an estimated 359 lives from June 2009 to March 2014. Applying the same standard to operations elsewhere has proved difficult, as was evident in the ambush in Niger.",

      "content": "When Bernie Sanders ran for president in 2016, his campaign was strikingly pro-labor. He proposed a $15-an-hour minimum wage, which was much further than most mainstream Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, were willing to go. He denounced a trans-Pacific trade deal that was anathema to many unions. He endorsed an organizing method, known as card check, that would allow workers to unionize without holding a secret-ballot election. Yet by the standards of the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination, the Bernie Sanders of four years ago was something of a piker. At least half the candidates who will appear in next week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential debate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Mr. Sanders \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have labor platforms that are more ambitious than his 2016 version. Several candidates have pledged to ban noncompete agreements, which hold down wages for workers, and mandatory-arbitration clauses, which prohibit lawsuits against employers. They would effectively require many companies to treat independent contractors as employees, making the workers eligible for the minimum wage and unemployment insurance. They would enact a number of measures that would help workers unionize and strike, like allowing them to lead boycotts of an employer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customers, which is currently illegal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the first time we see really robust agendas in labor and employment policy that are about unions and also about really high labor standards,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lawrence Mishel, the former president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoliticians have been willing to say some of this stuff, but they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been public about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Perhaps the most ambitious proposal is an idea known as sectoral bargaining, in which workers would bargain with employers on an industrywide basis rather than employer by employer. Sectoral bargaining, which is common in Europe, would make it possible to increase wages and benefits for millions of workers in relatively short order, even for those who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t union members. It would also give employers an incentive to create better-paying jobs because doing so would no longer bestow a major cost advantage on competitors. Under a sectoral bargaining system, unions or worker groups would have to show support from a certain share of workers in order to begin negotiating on their behalf \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, by getting 15 or 20 percent of workers in an industry to sign cards. At that point, a federal agency like the Labor Department would convene the bargaining, with employer groups on one side and the worker groups on the other. The agency would review any resulting agreement, which, once approved, would become binding on all employers in the industry. In recent months, Mr. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, along with Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker and Beto O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke, have released labor plans that would either enact sectoral bargaining or take significant strides in that direction by allowing workers to negotiate with multiple employers at once. That such a range of Democratic candidates have signed on to far-reaching labor proposals reflects the ways that lackluster wage growth, economic insecurity and widening inequality are upending politics and shattering a longstanding policy consensus. In the early stages of the economic recovery a decade ago, most workers were primarily concerned with avoiding unemployment, said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has conducted research on voters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 economic concerns. But as the expansion has plodded on, the focus has shifted from having any job to having a good job, which workers see as rare. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really trying to do something about what jobs pay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Lake said. With people increasingly open to more radical tools for accomplishing this, joining a union can seem downright middle of the road. According to recent polling by Pew Research Center, 42 percent of Americans view socialism favorably, up from 29 percent in 2010. During roughly that same time, support for unions has climbed significantly, from less than half to about two-thirds of Americans. The increased openness to unions and collective bargaining has dovetailed with a palpable shift in expert opinion. For decades, economists tended to play down the importance of unions, attributing much of the increase in income inequality to a growing demand for skilled workers that resulted from automation and the spread of information technology. Some otherwise liberal economists were skeptical or even hostile to unions, seeing them as cartels that drove up wages for their members at the cost of reducing employment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI learned this in graduate school in macro \u00e2\u0080\u0094 anti-union stuff from people who were highly inclined toward government redistribution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the economist and columnist Noah Smith, who earned his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan and has written about economists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 suspicion of unions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was this definite anti-union bias among liberals in the economics profession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But in recent years, many economists have begun to reconsider those views. Partly this reflects a broader ideological shift in the country away from the market-friendly policy approach of the 1980s and \u00e2\u0080\u009990s, which has lost credibility as inequality has widened. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe as social scientists live in a society where clearly the general social and political environment affects the questions we ask,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Arindrajit Dube, a labor economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. And partly this reflects a proliferation of research, which some of the campaigns have specifically cited, showing that employers have considerable power to hold down wages below the level the market would set. Whatever the case, there appears to be a growing consensus among center-left economists that unions are a critical check on the tendency of capital to vacuum up the gains from economic growth. A recent paper by economists at Princeton and Columbia showed that unions raised wages for low-skilled workers in the decades in which inequality was narrowing and concluded that unions have \u00e2\u0080\u009chad a significant, equalizing effect on the income distribution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A recent paper by the centrist Hamilton Project concluded that \u00e2\u0080\u009cunions lift wages, reduce inequality, and shape how work is organized.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then there is the growing consensus among union experts, including labor leaders, that improving workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 standards of living after decades of declining unionization requires a much more ambitious approach than the movement previously embraced. Before the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections, the politically powerful Service Employees International Union told candidates that they would have to present a detailed health care proposal to be considered for its endorsement. This year, the union asked candidates seeking its support to produce specific plans to help underpaid workers act collectively and urged them to incorporate industrywide bargaining as a key pillar. Other union experts have helped to deliver this message behind the scenes. Larry Cohen, a former president of the Communications Workers of America and a top volunteer adviser to Mr. Sanders in 2016 and now, said that he has been touting the importance of sectoral bargaining to Mr. Sanders in recent years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe last time I talked to him about this was right before he decided to run,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Cohen, who looked closely at sectoral bargaining systems in Norway and Argentina while traveling to those countries after the last election. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was genuinely excited by it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cohen has also been involved in an effort by two faculty members at Harvard Law School, known as the Clean Slate for Worker Power project, to convene dozens of labor experts, activists and organizers to reimagine labor law from the ground up. The group won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t publish its recommendations until January, but in the meantime it has worked to disseminate ideas like sectoral bargaining across the campaigns. Sharon Block and Benjamin Sachs, the Harvard faculty members involved, have weighed in with several campaigns that have embraced this approach, according to aides to Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Rourke and Mr. Booker. Ms. Block, a former Obama administration official and congressional staff member who is a veteran of legislative efforts to make unionizing and collective bargaining easier, said experience had taught her that advancing labor interests through provisions like card check doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work: Such measures tend to be too small to matter substantively, and they fail to generate political excitement among those who would benefit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe folks who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want this to happen will fight just as hard whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s small or big,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Block said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut doing something bigger makes moving legislation easier because you have the potential to have a much bigger constituency behind it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "author": "Neil Irwin",
      "content": "Financial markets are downright exuberant about the arrival of some trade peace \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least for now \u00e2\u0080\u0094 between the United States and China. President Trump boasted Friday afternoon of a \u00e2\u0080\u009csubstantial phase one deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d including Chinese purchases of American agricultural products and an accord on currency policy. The United States is also holding off on tariffs that were to go into effect next week. Over the last few days, the expectation of such a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmini-deal\u00e2\u0080\u009d between the two superpowers drove up stocks and helped ease recession fears. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question that this is good near-term news for the economy and the markets. But anybody who has followed the ups and downs of trade policy in the last two years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or who understands the actual ways that the trade wars are affecting the economy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be nearly as optimistic as the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words suggest are warranted. In the Trump trade strategy over the last two years, tariffs have acted as a ratchet \u00e2\u0080\u0094 moving  in only one direction or holding steady, never reversing. Apparent agreements are always subject to renegotiation. The administration turns up the pressure on China with sharp words, higher tariffs and promises of future tariffs. The Chinese retaliate, aiming to punish American interests. The stock market drops, which prompts negotiations to resume, and the administration backs off the pledged escalation. Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s events represent the latter stages of that cycle. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s particularly evident when you look at what the de-escalation consists of. The deal did not reduce tariffs already in place on Chinese imports but rather further delayed an increase that was announced during the escalation phase over the summer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only things we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned are that Trump loves tariffs and he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a long-term plan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre these guys in markets like Charlie Brown and the football?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The central tensions between the United States and China \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the domestic political constraints on each side that stand in the way of an overarching deal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 remain very much in place. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president, Xi Jinping, cannot back away from goals of dominating many of the industries of the future; President Trump cannot acquiesce to those goals without huge political risks. The new \u00e2\u0080\u009cphase one\u00e2\u0080\u009d deal does not address one of the most fraught issues, around the ability of the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to sell in the United States. Moreover, the recent history of American trade policy implies that even when a deal seems to be signed, sealed and delivered, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean trade peace has been achieved. In June, President Trump threatened to put new tariffs on Mexican imports to force the Mexican government to do more to curtail migration from Central America. The threat came after the conclusion of extended negotiations to rework Nafta into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Even though those particular Mexican tariffs never went into effect, the message to businesses was that trade tension is a new normal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not a limited, tactical war with achievable goals, but a perpetual state of aggression that can become more or less intense at any particular time. You can see that recognition in how businesses are behaving. The scale of the tariffs actually being collected thus far remains moderate relative to the scale of the United States economy. But there is plenty of evidence that this sense of trade chaos is hanging over business decision-making, especially in the export-focused manufacturing sector. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarkets may respond, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that firms will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Emily Blanchard, a trade economist at Dartmouth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tuck School of Business. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decisions that matter for the economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Business investment spending subtracted from overall G.D.P. in the second quarter, and job creation by the factory sector has slowed enormously in 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 only 3,000 jobs a month, down from 22,000 in 2018. A report on September factory activity showed it in negative territory. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is difficult to take that much comfort from the latest signs of progress given that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had plenty of apparent truces in recent months end abruptly in a sudden further escalation in trade tensions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Michael Pearce, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients. He noted a twist: The agreement on currency policy that is a key part of the new deal was part of a previous truce that then fell apart during a period of re-escalation. As that shows, in Trump-era trade policy, the risk of a major disruption to world commerce never really goes away. It just arrives in unpredictable waves \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deal represents a low ebb.",

      "author": "Jacey Fortin",
      "content": "Candidates, campaigns and companies have unleashed a flood of Facebook advertisements related to impeachment, and it might come as no surprise that President Trump and his re-election campaign are far outspending everyone else. But last week, the second biggest spender was an entity you might not be familiar with: a purveyor of pepper, paprika and poppy seeds based in Wisconsin. Penzeys Spices, a family-owned company in Wauwatosa, spent nearly $92,000 on Facebook advertisements related to impeachment from Sept. 29 to Oct. 5, according to data from a communications agency that tracks political spending. (That was eclipsed by Mr. Trump and his campaign, which spent more than $700,000.) Bill Penzey, who founded the company in 1986, said he found out about the second-place ranking on Wednesday when customers emailed him. When he shared the news with his wife, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe burst out laughing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA sort of, \u00e2\u0080\u0098What have you done this time?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 kind of laugh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Penzeys sells spices online and has dozens of brick-and-mortar stores across the United States. Mr. Penzey declined to share financial information but said the money he spends on Facebook ads is less than what he used to spend on print catalogs, which he stopped sending out about four years ago. The data on Facebook impeachment ads, which was reported by Axios on Wednesday, came from Bully Pulpit Interactive, a communications agency based in Washington whose 2020 Campaign Tracker shares information about political spending. The agency used an in-house program to identify Facebook ad copy with the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeach,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeachment\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpeaching,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a spokeswoman said. By those parameters, Penzeys beat out every other ad buyer in the country, save its commander in chief. The spice company topped Tom Steyer, the billionaire Democratic presidential candidate; Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader; the Democratic Governors Association; and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s publicly available data shows that from Oct. 2 to 8, Penzeys was the seventh-biggest spender on ads about \u00e2\u0080\u009csocial issues, elections or politics\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a broader category than just impeachment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the only entity in the top 10 that was not a politician or a policy-oriented organization. Penzeys spent nearly $120,000 on Facebook advertisements addressing politics during those seven days, Facebook data showed. (That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less than Democratic presidential candidates like Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Elizabeth Warren, but more than Pete Buttigieg.) The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ads aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t subtle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis week the curtain was finally pulled back on how deeply un-American the Republican Party has become,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one Facebook post on Oct. 3, referring to the impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump. The same post encouraged readers to sign up for a cooking newsletter. But Mr. Penzey has been politically outspoken for a while, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret to his customers. Followers of the chain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Facebook page regularly see long messages criticizing the latest Trump administration news, with spice-related content sprinkled in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like to say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a line we crossed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Penzey said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a line that crossed us. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve alway been about kindness and compassion. And with the recent trends in the Republican Party and unlimited political spending, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s created this message of anger toward marginalized people in order to create votes for tax cuts for the very wealthy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In May, the company advertised a spice called \u00e2\u0080\u009cJustice\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the ingredients include shallots, garlic, onion and green peppercorns \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while soliciting donations for the news organization Mother Jones. In July, it promoted a spice called Tsardust Memories \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it has salt, garlic, cinnamon, pepper, nutmeg and marjoram \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as a nod to Russian electoral interference, insisting in all caps that the issue was \u00e2\u0080\u009cNOT A NOTHING BURGER!!!!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d In November, the company used Facebook to encourage people to vote in the midterm elections. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let history lump you in with the white hoods and robes crowd,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Penzey said in a Nov. 2 post. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHistory has its eyes on all of us, and history remembers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Facebook has been criticized for taking a hands-off approach to moderating political content \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including paid ads \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even when they include false information. But it has also been accused of censorship by conservative politicians, including Mr. Trump, who argue that the social network is more accommodating to liberal points of view. Penzeys may use \u00e2\u0080\u009cseason liberally\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a trademarked slogan, but its outspokenness is not just a reaction to the president. The New York Times reported in 2006 that Mr. Penzey had started a food magazine that touched on prison reform, immigration policy and international adoption. He lost customers after his first issue featured a gay couple \u00e2\u0080\u0094 two men who had triplets via a surrogate mother \u00e2\u0080\u0094 long before gay marriage was legal in Wisconsin. The politics haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt Mr. Penzey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, he said, adding that he has lost some customers but gained some, too. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you are a company and you have values, now is the time to share them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Penzey said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow is the time that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to share them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The United States is sending about 3,000 additional troops to Saudi Arabia in the latest military response by the Trump administration after it accused Iran of attacks last month on Saudi oil facilities, the Pentagon said on Friday. The move came only five days after President Trump said that his desire to terminate America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cendless wars\u00e2\u0080\u009d led to his decision to pull back from the border area between Syria and Turkey about 50 troops who were working to create a \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe zone\u00e2\u0080\u009d between Turkish and Kurdish troops. State Department officials struggled on Friday to answer questions about how the roles of the incoming American forces in the Persian Gulf kingdom and those being pulled back from the Syrian border differed, and whether the deployments to Saudi Arabia contradicted the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategy of withdrawing from the Middle East. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe troops that we are sending into Saudi and the enhanced assets are defensive,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Brian H. Hook, the State Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s special representative for Iran. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are there to defend our interests and to help Saudi defend itself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said he was dispatching two Air Force fighter squadrons, or about four dozen warplanes, as well as Patriot antimissile batteries and other air and missile defenses to the kingdom. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSaudi Arabia is a longstanding security partner in the Middle East, and has asked for additional support to supplement their own defenses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Esper told reporters at the Pentagon, noting that he had called Saudi officials Friday morning to notify them. In the wake of the drone and missile strikes, which temporarily crippled about half of Saudi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oil production, Mr. Trump initially weighed taking direct military action against Iran. The attacks, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently called \u00e2\u0080\u009can act of war,\u00e2\u0080\u009d rattled global energy markets. For the past two weeks, however, there has been no discussion of taking direct American military action against Iran for the strikes, apart from some consideration of proportionate cyber attacks. Last month, Mr. Trump opted for a modest deployment of a couple of hundred troops, along with Patriot air and missile defense systems. Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement builds on those forces, although the fighter jets essentially will replace warplanes now flying off the carrier Abraham Lincoln, which will leave the Gulf of Oman in the coming weeks, military officials said. In response to Iranian attacks and provocations since May, Mr. Esper said the Pentagon has deployed about 14,000 additional forces to the gulf region. That includes airborne early warning aircraft, maritime patrol planes, Patriot air and missile defense batteries, B-52 bombers, a carrier strike group, armed Reaper drones and other engineering and support personnel. Since May, a spate of attacks have left six oil tankers damaged in the Gulf of Oman, with Washington accusing Tehran of inciting them. Iranian officials have denied that claim. The downing of an American drone in June by an Iranian surface-to-air missile only heightened tensions, prompting Mr. Trump to approve military strikes against Iran \u00e2\u0080\u0094 before abruptly pulling back. Mr. Esper repeated the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim \u00e2\u0080\u0094 backed by the United Kingdom, France and Germany \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Iran was also behind the attacks on the Saudi oil facilities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespite Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to deny their involvement, the evidence recovered so far proves that Tehran is responsible for these attacks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Esper said, without providing any proof. The Saudis have recovered pristine circuit boards from one of the cruise missiles that fell short of its target, providing forensics specialists the possibility of tracing the missile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of origin, according to a senior American official briefed on the intelligence. One theory gaining traction among American officials is that the cruise missiles were launched from Iran and programmed to fly around the northern Persian Gulf through Iraqi air space instead of directly across the gulf where the United States has much better surveillance. Mr. Hook called the increased military presence part of a growing pressure campaign \u00e2\u0080\u009cto deprive the Iranian regime of the money that it needs to destabilize the Middle East and to terrorize other regions of the worlds\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cto bring Iran to the negotiating table.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He argued that Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy already has fallen into recession and could suffer an economic depression. But Mr. Hook struggled when asked how Mr. Trump squares his abhorrence of sending troops to the Middle East with his decision to bolster troop levels in Saudi Arabia. Mr. Hook differentiated between forces that are actively at war and those that are largely in peacekeeping or deterrent roles. Mr. Hook avoided saying much about the Turkey decision, which many of his colleagues in the State Department \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and many Republican lawmakers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 regarded as a major error. But he said that it was Mr. Trump himself who sent Mr. Pompeo to Saudi Arabia after the mid-September attack on its oil facilities \u00e2\u0080\u009cso that we could have this discussion about their defensive needs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

      "content": "Last month, the Trump family business received approval from a local government in Scotland for a major expansion of its golf resort near Aberdeen, marking the largest real estate development financed by the Trump Organization since the 2016 election. In August, President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eldest son, Donald Jr., flew to Jakarta to help kick-start sales at a pair of Trump-branded luxury resorts planned for Indonesia. He appeared at a private event with wealthy prospective buyers and joined his politically connected billionaire Indonesian business partner at a news conference. And last year, Donald Jr. visited India to sell condos at future Trump-branded towers, appearing at an event that also featured India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prime minister. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m here as a businessman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump told the gathering in New Delhi. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not representing anyone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But for the children of the politically powerful, personal business and public dealings can often be indistinguishable, especially when private projects depend on foreign governments that are looking to bolster ties with Washington. In recent weeks, as the president has become embroiled in a scandal involving his interactions with Ukraine, Donald Trump Jr. and his brother Eric have taken to attacking Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., for his business dealings in Ukraine and China. The brothers have accused him of leveraging his family name for personal gain while his father served in the Obama administration. Among other things, Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that has been a focus of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in the country. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the VERY LEAST, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the appearance of impropriety,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA clear conflict of interest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At a rally in Minneapolis on Thursday, Eric Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charged remarks about the former vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son inspired the crowd of Trump supporters to chant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLock him up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Republicans, led by the president, have sought to make Hunter Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s international business dealings an issue in the impeachment debate in Washington. But the high-profile attack roles being played by Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eldest sons have now thrust their own business dealings into the spotlight too. Both sons have operated and promoted the Trump family business overseas during their father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidency, even as he retains ownership. And while the Trump and Biden father-son relationships differ in many ways, the business dealings have set up a simple parallel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are criticizing the vice president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son for doing exactly what they are doing themselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Martin Ford, a member of the Aberdeenshire Council in Scotland, which voted last month to approve a proposal by the Trumps to build a 500-unit housing development. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are conducting international business here in Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Eric Trump, in a statement to The New York Times, said there was a distinction between his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career in business, with his recent turn to politics, and Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decades in public office. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen my father became president, our family stopped doing international business deals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, a reference to a pledge by the Trump Organization not to begin new overseas projects during the Trump presidency. Hunter Biden, he said, did the opposite when his father became vice president. The Trump business activities in India, Indonesia and Scotland were considered in compliance with the pledge, according to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ethics rules, because they were building on deals already in the works. Mr. Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign declined to comment on Friday. But in a tweet, the former vice president once again suggested that the attacks on his son were part of a political smear campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me make something clear to President Trump: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going anywhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to destroy me. And you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to destroy my family. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care how dirty the attacks get.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Conducting business on the international stage has long been standard for the Trump Organization, which has placed the Trump name on hotels and towers in several countries. But its international dealings have become far more complicated since Mr. Trump took office and his sons took leadership of the business, especially when foreign governments have been involved to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benefit. When the Trump Organization tangled with the majority owner of a property in Panama, for example, its local lawyers at one point called on the Panamanian president for an assist. In Indonesia, the government is helping to build a major new highway that will make a new Trump development more accessible. Construction is scheduled to begin soon on what will be known as Trump Residences Lido, which will include 280 homes, a golf course and a hotel, south of Jakarta. The Trump family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partner in Indonesia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a billionaire named Hary Tanoesoedibjo \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is financing the project, with the Trump family getting a cut of the sales. In marketing materials released this summer, which featured the Trump family logo and a photograph of Donald Trump Jr., the company noted that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump Residences Lido can be accessed directly through the newly opened Bocimi Toll Road.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In Scotland, the Aberdeenshire Council recently dropped an earlier requirement that the new housing development could not be built until the Trumps spent tens of millions of dollars on other investments at the resort. Sebastian Leslie, a local official who supported the project, said the family received no special consideration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give anybody special favors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Leslie said. But Mr. Martin, a council member who opposed the approval, said the Trumps benefited handsomely from the change. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a much, much more lucrative deal now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Revenues coming to the Trump family in the United States have drawn scrutiny too, including at the Trump International Hotel in Washington \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a property, opened in the final stages of the 2016 campaign, that has flourished while Donald Trump Jr. and Eric have run the company. The hotel has been a magnet for Republican lobbyists and political fund-raisers, and companies and foreign officials with business before the Trump administration have thrown parties there, including the Kuwait embassy and the government of Azerbaijan. Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter Ivanka has also retained a stake in the family business even as she serves as a White House adviser, and last year she received trademarks in China related to her separate fashion ventures. Her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, maintains a stake in his own family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real estate business, which has received and sought funding from international sources as well. In 2017, Mr. Kushner met privately at the White House with top executives from Citibank and the private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Those meetings came as the firms were contemplating sizable loans to his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, Kushner Companies, which they did eventually make. And since Mr. Kushner entered the White House, his family has courted state-connected investors in China and the Middle East \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both regions that were in Mr. Kushner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government portfolio \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to bail out the firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headquarters at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. But the presidency has also come with some costs for the Trump family business since the sons have been at the helm. The company had been banking on global expansion to drive its growth, but when the president agreed to put a hold on new foreign deals, it curtailed those ambitions for his sons. George Sorial, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief compliance counsel when the policy was developed, said it was the right thing to do even though it was not required by law and had cost the company significantly. Eric Trump, in his statement to The Times, suggested that even the decision to forgo new foreign deals could be seen through the prism of Hunter Biden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father was one of the most famous businessmen on earth and he sacrificed billions to be our president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJoe Biden was an incredibly influential politician \u00e2\u0080\u0094 his family made millions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Biden campaign also sees opportunity in the nasty dispute. In a fund-raising email sent on Friday, the campaign singled out the Trump sons and the \u00e2\u0080\u009clock him up\u00e2\u0080\u009d chant at the Thursday rally. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are fighting back against this nonsense as hard as we know how every single day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the campaign wrote.",

      "content": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump announced Friday the resignation of Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary for the Department of Homeland Security who spent his six-month tenure trying to curb a surge of asylum seekers at the southwestern border while managing a turbulent relationship with a president intent on restricting immigration. Noting that they had \u00e2\u0080\u009cworked well together with Border Crossings being way down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Mr. McAleenan wanted \u00e2\u0080\u009cto spend more time with his family and go to the private sector.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. McAleenan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure from the White House came after he tried to embrace the president's increasingly aggressive assault on legal and illegal immigration publicly even as he privately resisted some of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most extreme ideas. A former deputy commissioner for the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s border security agency under President Barack Obama, Mr. McAleenan watched in recent months as the White House surrounded him with Fox News contributors to key positions in the agency. In an interview last week with The Washington Post, Mr. McAleenan complained about what he called the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctone, the message, the public face and approach\u00e2\u0080\u009d of immigration policy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a not-so-subtle reproach of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own language. The comments enraged some of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staunchest allies, who had already targeted Mr. McAleenan for resisting nationwide deportation raids this year against migrant families. Mr. McAleenan went to the White House on Friday to offer his resignation and volunteered to stay on the job until the end of the month, a move made in part to avoid having the president assert that he had forced him out, according to administration officials. In his resignation letter, Mr. McAleenan attributed his exit to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersonal and family reasons\u00e2\u0080\u009d and described his tenure as \u00e2\u0080\u009cgalvanizing and enervating.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The president said in his tweet that he would name a head of the agency next week, although it was unclear who would succeed Mr. McAleenan. The deputy secretary of homeland security, David Pekoske, is serving in an acting position. The Vacancies Act stipulates that the position must go to certain ranked officials in the department, but according to two people briefed on the circumstances surrounding Ms. Nielsen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure, rules were changed that rendered the act moot, which may necessitate additional changes for the White House to appoint a person of the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choosing. Under Mr. McAleenan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership, the Department of Homeland Security sought to curb a surge of Central American families from crossing the southwestern border with policies that Democrats and immigration advocates described as cruel and inhumane. In the spring, the department came under fire for not providing adequate care to migrant children in cramped Border Patrol facilities that were built to hold single adults. Mr. McAleenan expanded a program that has forced about 50,000 migrants, most of them asylum seekers, to stay in Mexico \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including in areas where the State Department has issued warnings to American citizens because of its high level of violence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while they await their immigration hearing in the United States. He has signed deals with Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras that would deny asylum protections to most Central American migrants if they failed to apply for them in at least one country on their way to the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 southwestern border. The agreements have not yet been enforced, but the Supreme Court allowed the United States to unilaterally deny the protections to most Central American migrants at the border. While Mr. McAleenan commanded respect among law enforcement officials in the department and some Democrats, others blamed him for going along with the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to separate families at the border, denying green cards to poor immigrants and turning a security agency created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks into the engine of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immigration agenda. On Monday, Mr. McAleenan was forced off the stage at Georgetown Law School, where he was scheduled to participate in an immigration forum. Protesters held signs that said \u00e2\u0080\u009cStand with immigrants\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cHate is not normal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They chanted until he left the stage. Mr. McAleenan, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth homeland security secretary, appeared to be on his way out almost from the moment he replaced Kirstjen Nielsen, who was fired in April by Mr. Trump in a purge of several top immigration officials in the administration. The president never nominated Mr. McAleenan to permanently assume the position and sometimes offered weak praise for the job he was doing. While Mr. McAleenan believed in restoring state department aid for Central American countries, Mr. Trump often assailed the nations and the migrants crossing at the border. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI also believe strongly in investing in the growing collaboration with the governments of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, and see real opportunity to change the dynamic in the region through these partnerships,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. McAleenan said in his resignation letter. While Mr. McAleenan had the strong backing of Jared Kushner, the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son-in-law and senior adviser, he clashed over personnel decisions with Stephen Miller, a White House aid and the architect of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immigration agenda. In recent months, Mr. McAleenan grew increasingly irritated by the harsh language used by agency officials installed by the White House. Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, who once advocated an end to birthright citizenship, was installed to lead the agency that manages legal immigration. Mark Morgan, who once said he could determine future gang members by looking at detained migrant children, was selected to oversee Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He then replaced John Sanders, an ally of Mr. McAleenan, to lead Customs and Border Protection. Both are serving in acting positions. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House Homeland Security committee, derided the department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turnover. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresident Trump cannot continue to rely on instilling \u00e2\u0080\u0098acting\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and potentially unlawful \u00e2\u0080\u0094 figureheads for this critical position,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Thompson said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe next secretary must also understand that bowing to President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obsession over a wall and keeping people out is not part of the job description.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mike Rogers, Republican of Alabama and the ranking member of the committee, praised Mr. McAleenan for reducing the flow of migrant families to the border. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKevin McAleenan was dealt an incredibly tough hand when he took on the role of acting secretary this spring \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we were in the midst of a humanitarian and security crisis at our southwest border,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rogers said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFortunately, he was up to the task.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. McAleenan, a former lawyer who attended Amherst College, had pushed back on some of the White House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initiatives. When Mr. Morgan and advocated widespread deportations to round up families that recently crossed the border, Mr. McAleenan delayed the operation for fear that families would be separated in the interior of the country and agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 safety would be at risk. When Mr. Trump threatened Mexico with tariffs this spring, Mr. McAleenan helped secure a deal that deployed Mexico\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military to its southern border to halt migration to the United States. While homeland security grappled with the highest number of crossings at the southwestern border in more than a decade in May, the figures have declined by more than 65 percent. Along the way, migrants forced to wait in Mexico have been subjected to kidnappings and violence.",

      "content": "LAKE CHARLES, La. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 President Trump left a dizzying trail of developments behind him in Washington on Friday evening, swapping the confines of the capital for a fiery rally where he used foul language, fierce political attacks and personal grievances to light up his supporters for the second day in a row. The president lashed out at the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, saying that the top Democrat in Congress \u00e2\u0080\u009chates this country\u00e2\u0080\u009d and ridiculing her decision to begin an impeachment inquiry into his efforts to get foreign countries to dig up damaging information on his rivals. To the delight of thousands who repeatedly roared their approval, Mr. Trump denounced the impeachment inquiry and condemned what he called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cunholy alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians, deep-state bureaucrats and the fake news media.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe radical Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 policies are crazy. Their politicians are corrupt. Their candidates are terrible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said to huge applause. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd they know they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win on Election Day so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pursuing an illegal, invalid and unconstitutional bullshit impeachment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Regarding Ms. Pelosi, he said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe hates the country. Nancy Pelosi hates the United States of America, because she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be doing this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest political rally came only a day after he appeared in front of supporters in Minneapolis to deliver a profanity-laced screed against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and called his younger son, Hunter, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca loser.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump only briefly returned to Washington, where an impeachment inquiry surrounding his efforts to pressure the Ukrainian president to uncover damaging information about the Bidens is rapidly moving forward. In a head-spinning 24 hours before departing for Louisiana, Mr. Trump announced a preliminary deal with China that will forestall a tariff increase, and the Pentagon announced it would send additional troops to Saudi Arabia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a decision, Mr. Trump said before departing Washington, was made because the Saudis had \u00e2\u0080\u009cagreed to pay us for everything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial team must turn over eight years of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial information to a House committee. Separately, judges in three states ruled against the administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to withhold green cards from immigrants who receive public assistance. And in a closed-door deposition on Capitol Hill, Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine, offered a scathing assessment of the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to foreign policy, adding that she believed Mr. Trump had personally pushed for her removal for months. Asked about Ms. Yovanovitch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony before he left Washington, Mr. Trump said that Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak favorably\u00e2\u0080\u009d about her during the July 25 phone call that has formed the basis of the impeachment inquiry. Amid it all, Mr. Trump left again for the campaign trail, which he has long employed as a useful conduit for his most provocative language, particularly when he feels the confines of Washington closing in. Upon landing, he announced the departure of Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security who had publicly expressed frustration with the job in recent weeks. Once the president took the stage in this southwestern corner of the state, he defended himself against those pursuing impeachment, singling out Ms. Pelosi and Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Schiff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision during a committee hearing to liken the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks in the July 25 call to a mobster issuing a veiled threat drew the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ire on Friday, as it had for weeks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe made it up: It was fiction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, congressman, are you immune from something like that? That should be a crime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Throughout the rally, Mr. Trump seemed to abruptly switch emotional channels. He toggled between lashing out at Democrats to acting out an imagined back-and-forth between two former F.B.I. officials, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, in order to mock them for exchanging unflattering text messages about Mr. Trump during his candidacy. He also paused at one point to interview Little League ballplayers about their pitching speeds. Eventually, he circled back to his original purpose for the visit: testing his political influence over local races ahead of Saturday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary election, largely following the same attack-style playbook he deployed last month in a close North Carolina race. Earlier on Friday, Mr. Trump urged his supporters to vote for one of two Republican candidates running to replace John Bel Edwards, the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic governor. At the rally, the president said that Mr. Edwards was \u00e2\u0080\u009c100 percent going to drop the Second Amendment\u00e2\u0080\u009d and sought to cast the centrist governor in the same light as other popular target at his rallies, including Ms. Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader. Mr. Trump was joined by Mr. Edward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican challengers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ralph Abraham, a third-term congressman, and Eddie Rispone, a Baton Rouge businessman \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but did not endorse either. The goal on Saturday, he said, was to keep Mr. Edwards from earning the majority of the vote and avoiding a runoff. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI need you to send the radical Democrat establishment a loud and clear message,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump told the crowd. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are going to fire your Democratic governor. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done a lousy job.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Mr. Edwards remains the leader in the race, with recent polls showing that he is likely to draw about 47 percent of the vote. Keeping with a tradition of Louisiana Democrats, he is largely a centrist, and earlier this year pleased conservatives when he signed a restrictive law that bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected. He is also practiced at the art of political survival in deep-red territories: Last year, he was the only Democratic lawmaker to attend the first state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that honored Emmanuel Macron, the president of France. On Friday, the governor responded to the president on Twitter by defending his track record on the Second Amendment, and saying that he looked forward to working with Mr. Trump during his second term. The particulars of the governor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or any of the other more pressing news matters of the day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 did not seem to concern Mr. Trump as he spoke for nearly an hour and a half. As news broke that Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal lawyers, was under investigation over whether he broke foreign lobbying laws in his work with Ukraine, the president was speaking about the importance of voter identification laws, and telling his supporters how much he loved them.",
