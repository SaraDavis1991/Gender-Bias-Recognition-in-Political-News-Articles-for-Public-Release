        "subtitle": "The fifth Democrat debate will be held on Wednesday, Nov. 20, in Atlanta, Georgia, co-hosted by MSNBC and the\u00a0Washington Post from 9:00 to 11:00 p.m.",

        "content": " Biden still holds a lead in South Carolina, where he is relying on strong support from African-American voters. However, he is no longer the clear nationwide frontrunner. One thing the two have in common, however, is that they both avoid post-debate spin rooms. Buttigieg made a brief appearance on a news set after the third debate, in Houston, in September, but barely ventured into the area where journalists were standing, and ignored questions.  Biden has avoided spin rooms entirely, sending surrogates instead. Most candidates use their time in the spin room to elaborate on points they made in the debate, and to generate additional media exposure. ",

A national USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll asked likely Democratic voters whom among the party's past presidential nominees would have the most influence on their vote today. Two-thirds named former president Obama, who moved out of the White House almost three years ago. Obama hasn't endorsed anyone so far, including his former vice president, Joe Biden. Kate Pritchard, 63, a retired teacher from Durango, Colorado, is supporting New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at the moment, but she's not sure he can go the distance. If Obama were to endorse a candidate, she would back that person. \"That would be very powerful,\" she said in a follow-up interview after being called in the survey. In the poll, 11% cited former president Jimmy Carter, who at age 95 is\u00a0still building houses and doing other good works, as influential with them. But all the other former nominees registered in single digits. The only other nominee to win the White House, Bill Clinton, was named by just 6%. Hillary Clinton, the party's standardbearer the last time around, also was cited by 6%. Al Gore, the 2000 nominee, was named by 3%, and Michael Dukakis (1988), John Kerry (2004)\u00a0and Walter Mondale (1984) by 1% each. Asked whom would have the least influence on their vote, Dukakis ranked first, at 23%, and Hillary Clinton was second, at 18%. USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll: Biden's lead narrows in turbulent Democratic field Hillary Clinton created a firestorm last week when she called one of the 2020 contenders, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, \"a favorite of the Russians.\" That brought denials from Gabbard and a divided judgment by\u00a0Democratic voters. In the poll, 46% said Hillary Clinton should continue to speak out about issues important to her.\u00a0Precisely the same number, 46%, said she shouldn't inject herself into the 2020 election. The poll of 399 likely Democratic primary and caucus voters, taken by phone from Oct. 23-26, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\" Frequently raising unsubstantiated claims, Trump mostly bypassed his standard lines touting the economy and his get-tough stance on immigration in favor of offering supporters a series of broadsides against the former vice president and his son, Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine and China. \u201cWhatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he?\" Trump later added.\u00a0His campaign, midway through his remarks, began selling t-shirts emblazoned with the words \"Where's Hunter?\" Pelosi reiterated during her call with Democrats that though she thought ill of Trump's comments, that's not what the impeachment investigation was about, stating, \u201cWhat we are doing on impeachment is about the facts \u2013 \u2018Just the facts, ma\u2019am\u2019 \u2013 and the Constitution.\u00a0 His policy, his personality, his potty-mouth, that\u2019s about the election and let\u2019s make sure that we understand the reasons.\" \"The inquiry is because he has not honored his oath of office.\u00a0 We will honor ours,\u201d she continued, according to the aide. Pelosi opened an impeachment inquiry against Trump to review\u00a0whether he pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0to dig up dirt on the Biden's\u00a0by withholding foreign aid. \u201cI\u2019ve said before Trump, himself, is not worthy of impeachment because it\u2019s divisive in the county.\u00a0 But our Constitution is worth it. Our democracy is worth it. And, our republic, if we can save it, is worth it,\u201d Pelosi stated. During a rally\u00a0in Lake Charles, Louisiana, Friday night, Trump\u00a0accused\u00a0Democrats of waging an \u201cunconstitutional and bullshit impeachment,\u201d to roars of the crowd.

        "author": "",
        "date": "null",
        "content": "Social Security is one of the most contentious issues in American politics, and as the 2020 presidential campaign continues to ramp up, candidates have looked at ways to change the program. In particular, an increasing number of proposals have looked for ways to expand Social Security to extend larger benefits to some recipients, especially those in demographic groups who have greater financial needs. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,\u00a0has long been a proponent of expanding Social Security.\u00a0\u00a0She recently revealed her latest proposal about the program. Warren's strategy would make major changes to Social Security, boosting benefits for all and imposing new taxes on high-income earners to finance them. Is Social Security going bankrupt?:3 facts most people get wrong on retirement income Warren's proposal focuses on the financial straits that many Social Security recipients are in right now. According to her numbers, more than 7 million senior citizens live under the poverty line. With costs of living on the rise, especially in key areas for seniors like health care, it's hard to make ends meet. Few older Americans have significant retirement savings, and many even still have considerable debt to repay. Warren also notes that younger workers have even greater challenges. Between tough economic conditions in the labor market and high debt, it's been hard for typical Gen Xers and millennials to make much headway toward financial security. Lastly, Social Security's financial condition poses an approaching\u00a0threat. Current expectations have the Social Security trust funds running out of money in 2035, and that could bring about benefit cuts of roughly 20%. Social Security:3 things that determine how much money you get In response, Warren offers a simple remedy: a higher Social Security benefit for all. Under the proposal, everyone would get a $200 increase in monthly payments from Social Security, including both retirement and disability benefits. It would also tie future cost of living adjustments to a measure of inflation that's tailored toward the basket of goods and services that older Americans have to pay. Certain groups would see even larger increases. Family caregivers would have the value of their work recognized for Social Security eligibility and benefit calculation purposes, which Warren says will especially help women and people of color. Disabled widows and widowers would be able to claim survivor benefits earlier, and Warren's plan would reinstate special minimum benefit rules that would ensure an annual benefit of at least 125% of the federal poverty line. Public-sector employees would avoid negative adjustments from provisions like the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset. In order to cover these benefits and shore up Social Security's future finances, Warren would impose two new taxes. First, a new payroll tax would apply to wages above $250,000, with employees paying 7.4% and employers matching with 7.4% of their own. This is above the 6.2% employee rate that applies to current wages up to $132,900 in 2019, under the rationale that Social Security should have a similarly progressive tax rate structure as the regular income tax system does. Warren notes that the current payroll tax scheme for Social Security is regressive as it charges no tax on earnings above the wage base limit. Second, individual filers making more than $250,000 or joint filers above $400,000 would owe a heightened net investment income tax at a rate of 14.8%. That would be in addition to the current 2.9% net investment income tax, which is based on the Medicare payroll tax withholding rate. Elizabeth Warren at NYC rally:'Donald Trump is corruption in the flesh' Warren argues that the new taxes would simply be \"asking the top 2% to contribute their fair share to the program.\" It's not the first time that the presidential candidate has targeted the rich, with a previous proposal seeking to impose a wealth tax on those with a net worth above $50 million. Critics of that wealth tax were quick to note ways that wealthy taxpayers could potentially avoid paying it. With the payroll tax system already having the collection infrastructure in place across millions for employers throughout the nation, the new Social Security taxes would avoid some of the enforcement problems that the wealth tax would have faced. The Warren proposal breaks new ground by largely disconnecting the benefits that Social Security pays from the wages on which the program collects taxes. That's sure to draw the ire of opponents, and regardless of what happens in the 2020 election, the issue of Social Security will remain a contentious one well into the future.

        "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 The bruising campaign for the White House between President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger will take center\u00a0stage in 2020 but it's the contest for control of the Senate that will determine the presidential winner's ability to pass legislation, appoint judges and fund priorities. Democrats, who effectively control 47 seats, need to flip at least four Republican Senate seats to recapture the upper chamber\u00a0\u2013 or three if they win back the White House since the vice president breaks ties. Republicans hold 23 of the\u00a035 seats up for grabs next year, giving Democrats nearly twice as many pick-up opportunities. Adding to the Democrats' optimism is that many of the races are in states where the president's approval rating sits well under 50%. Republicans counter that all but two (Colorado and Maine) of the GOP seats up for election are in states Trump won in 2016. And the two most vulnerable Democrats are in states (Alabama\u00a0and Michigan) that Trump won. Thirteen months out from Election Day, there remains plenty of questions: Will primary voters nominate moderates or party reactionaries that would have a tougher time winning a general election? How will the the Democratic presidential nominee influence\u00a0down-ballot Senate races? What kind of effect will congressional Democrats' pursuit of Trump's impeachment have on voters? \u201cSo many things we don\u2019t know,\" said Jennifer Duffy, a long-time Senate analyst\u00a0with the non-partisan\u00a0Cook Political Report. Duffy and others watching 2020 elections give Democrats less than a 50-50 chance of recapturing the Senate considering there are only a handful of states in play right now. The debates:Schedule set for 2020 general election presidential and vice presidential debates Already the attack ads have been launched by both parties. Republicans are painting Democratic candidates as socialists who back far-left policies such as \"Medicare\u00a0for All,\" free college tuition and radical climate change remedies like the Green\u00a0New Deal. They've begun airing ads in some states that feature Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman New York Democrat and social media star who embodies the party's left-wing ideology. Democrats are portraying Republicans as climate deniers and anti-immigration zealots who blindly back Trump. They've started\u00a0airing ads with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican whom opponents accuse of protecting Trump and obstructing important legislation from even getting a floor vote. There is a soundness to each side's partisan strategy: In\u00a02016, every Senate seat up for election was won by the party whose presidential nominee also captured that state. Here's a look at the states in play and the chances the Senate could flip back to Democrats: The two Republicans who represent states that Hillary Clinton captured in 2016\u00a0\u2013 Cory Gardner in Colorado and Susan Collins in Maine\u00a0\u2013 are top targets for Democrats next year. As a freshman senator who squeaked in five years ago, Gardner is considered more vulnerable than Collins, who won her fourth term in 2014 with 68% of the vote. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's entry into the race gives Democrats a formidable challenger with\u00a0high name recognition in a state where Democrats will try to capitalize on\u00a0issues such as climate change and health care. But Republicans say Hickenlooper's shaky performance during a short stint as a 2020\u00a0presidential candidate and an expected primary challenge\u00a0from former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff may wound him\u00a0in the\u00a0general election. Susan Collins:For Sen. Susan Collins, a tough reelection got a lot tougher with Trump impeachment inquiry Collins' long-held image as a moderate voice on Capitol Hill took on water last year with her pivotal vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Progressives fumed over\u00a0her vote, promising to raise money and turn out Mainers to keep her from winning a fifth term. Collins was leading\u00a0her likely Democratic opponent, state House Speaker Sara Gideon, by double digits in a Gravis Marketing poll released in June. But there was a\u00a0potential warning sign for the incumbent: the same poll found 48% approved of Collins' performance \u2013\u00a0the same percentage that disapproved. Few GOP incumbents have a bigger bullseye than Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona. The former Air Force fighter pilot has a stellar resume but she is running in an increasingly purple state against a well-funded and high-profile challenger: former astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of former congresswoman and gun-control advocate Gabby\u00a0Giffords. Kelly is a\u00a0first-time candidate and Republican strategists said they hope to exploit that lack of experience on the campaign trail. McSally has never won statewide (she lost a Senate race in 2018 and was appointed to fill the vacancy created by John McCain's death last year). But she wields the power of incumbency and Trump's endorsement could turn out\u00a0conservative Arizonans wary of McSally. Democrats are optimistic they can flip the seats of two other Republican incumbents\u00a0\u2013 Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Joni Ernst of Iowa. Of the two,\u00a0Tillis is in deeper peril, according to political experts, partly because there are signs the state might not be as red as it was in 2016. A\u00a0Charlotte-area congressional seat that Trump won by 12 points in 2016 barely went for a Trump-endorsed Republican in a special election earlier this year. Tom Steyer:Tom Steyer has been pushing impeachment for years. Now it's center stage for his first debate Just as Republicans Gardner and Collins must find cross-over appeal in states that voted in 2016 for Clinton, Democrats Doug Jones (Alabama) and Gary Peters (Michigan) face a similar challenge because they're running for reelection in states that Trump won. Jones is considered the most vulnerable incumbent running in 2020 \u2013 Democrat or Republican \u2013 chiefly because he represents a state that Trump carried by nearly 28 percentage points. Jones, the only Senate Democrat in the Deep South,\u00a0came to the Senate after winning a closely contested special election in 2017 over Republican Roy Moore,\u00a0who was tainted by allegations he had romantically pursued and sexually assaulted teenage girls when he was in his 30s. Moore is running again but so are other Republicans, including Congressman Bradley Byrne and former Auburn Football Coach\u00a0Tommy Tuberville, neither of whom\u00a0carry the political baggage that helped Jones win his seat. Republicans also believe that Peters is very beatable, largely because many Michiganders don't know him or aren't sure what to make of him. Polls show more than a third of state voters don't have a firm opinion of him despite nearly five years in office. Peters is \"weak\" Duffy said. \"It\u2019s not that he has angered voters. It\u2019s that they have no idea who he is.\u201d Republicans are also optimistic because\u00a0GOP businessman and Army veteran John James, who outperformed expectations in a 2018 loss to Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabinow,\u00a0has entered the race. Nita Lowey:Longtime Rep. Nita Lowey won't seek reelection in 2020 A senator's decision not to seek reelection presents a rare opportunity\u00a0for opposing parties because it traditionally provides a better chance to flip a seat when there's no incumbent touting years of constituent achievement or legislative accomplishment. But none of the four open seats \u2013 three GOP states (Georgia, Kansas\u00a0and Tennessee) and one Democratic (New Mexico)\u00a0\u2013 are in much danger of changing party control, according to political analysts. Traditionally red Kansas could be the exception if Republican Kris Kobach wins the primary. The immigration hard-liner who lost a gubernatorial contest to\u00a0Democrat Laura Kelly in 2018 is seen by analysts and political operatives on both sides as a\u00a0weak candidate who would likely put the state in play if he wins the GOP nomination next year. Georgia's open seat (created by the early retirement\u00a0of Republican Johnny Isakson) will be paired with Republican David Perdue's reelection bid. That would give Democrats two chances to pick up a seat in\u00a0a Deep South state that's been trending more purple recently. But chances of winning one of those were hurt when rising Democratic star Stacy Abrams opted not to run.",

        "content": "All 12\u00a0leading Democratic candidates for president got a chance to demonstrate why they were able to meet the requirements to pack on the stage for the fourth debate Tuesday. Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts stayed feisty and focused in her new role as front-runner. Former Vice President Joe Biden was optimistic and self-congratulatory as he tried to win the John McCain name-dropping contest. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii confounded everyone by spreading the blame for the slaughter of the Kurds in northern Syria that Donald Trump invited to members of \u201cboth parties.\u201d And Andrew Yang got to say lots of things as if no one had ever thought of them before. But the winner of the night was older than the two youngest candidates on stage \u2014 Gabbard, 38, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 37 \u2014 combined. Vermont Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders, 78, returned to the campaign trail after recovering from a heart attack to deliver his strongest debate performance of the campaign. He was lively, funny and persuasive. At one\u00a0point, he even seemed to convince billionaire Tom Steyer that billionaires shouldn\u2019t exist. Sanders also took on Biden\u2019s constant praise of bipartisanship and his pointed boast, \u201cI'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done.\u201d \u201cJoe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut you know what you also got done \u2014 and I say this as a good friend \u2014 you got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements like NAFTA and PNTR (permanent normal trade relations)\u00a0with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs. Now, let's get to 'Medicare for All.' ... If we stood together, we could create the greatest health care system in the world.\u201d A conservative's take:Winners and losers in the Democratic debate from columnist Glenn Harlan Reynolds But Bernie\u2019s biggest moment of the night didn\u2019t happen onstage. In the closing minutes of the debate, news broke that one of the brightest young stars on America\u2019s left, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York,\u00a0will endorse the 2016 Democratic primary runner-up this weekend. This gives the democratic socialist from Vermont the chance to break the momentum of Warren\u2019s steady rise in the polls, though he notably hasn\u2019t taken a shot at the senator from Massachusetts on the debate stage yet. Instead, he sided with her several times as she was cornered, echoing her arguments for systemic change. The format of the debate flowed much better than the previous three. It\u2019s unclear whether\u00a0this\u00a0was because the moderators allowed the candidates more air to answer and rebut each other, or because self-help guru Marianne Williamson wasn\u2019t on the stage. Whatever it is, they should do more of it. While there are still miles to go before anyone actually votes for a nominee, the race for the chance to oppose Trump will likely remain a tossup among\u00a0Sanders, Warren and Biden. This is mostly because the rest of the candidates have done a better job of canceling each other out than breaking through. While the debates have led to some blips in the polls \u2014 most notably for Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris of California after the second debate \u2014 the crowded stage format has the effect of blurring candidates together, especially since every debate seems to rehash the same Medicare for All contentions over and over until even Sanders seems a little bored by the fray. Another huge winner of the night was impeachment, which is now polling\u00a050%. Every candidate on stage backs the inquiry in the House, and no candidate showed any willingness to echo the attacks on Hunter Biden that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into trumping up. Unfortunately, the biggest loser of the night was human civilization. While there was a question about Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 defense of her kindness to former president and torture purveyor George W. Bush, there wasn\u2019t one question about climate change. Future generations will have to be satisfied\u00a0knowing that we were much too busy worrying about rich people getting along in luxury boxes to stop the planet from boiling.

        "content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden dodged some of the piling on from other 2020 candidates he has seen in previous Democratic debates, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren took on a lot of that heat on Tuesday. Biden thinks that's a good thing, but questioned Warren's standing as a frontrunner in comments to reporters in Ohio on Wednesday. \"Well, it's kind of about time other people get questioned,\" he said. \"You know, I haven't seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a frontrunner. You guys keep talking about that.\" \"I think Elizabeth Warren's done very well,\" Biden added. \"She's moved, but now that she has moved and is taken more seriously, people are going to ask her about a little candor here. Tell us how you're going to do what you say you're going to do\" More:Elizabeth Warren is a new front-runner in town. Just ask her Democratic rivals The Massachusetts senator has led\u00a0Biden by a slim margin in several national polls and in some\u00a0early voting states like Iowa. While Biden had a significant lead on both Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earlier this year, data shows Warren steadily closing that gap. Warren faced attacks at the debate from South Bend, Indiana,\u00a0Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who both pressed her on issues such as her Medicare for All plan. Warren has repeatedly skirted a direct answer when asked if her plan will require tax increases on the middle class, something Biden has criticized her for heavily. But she maintains that overall costs will go down. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential thing in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board,\" Biden said Wednesday. At the debate, tensions flared between Biden, whose vision for the Democratic Party includes an approach akin to the Obama-Biden administration, and Warren, who is an icon for some in the more progressive wing in the party. When Warren discussed her work on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama era, Biden jumped in, saying he had rounded up votes in the Senate for it. \"Let's get that straight,\" he said. Warren responded after a pause, \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\" Biden later cut her off, \"You did a hell of a job in your job.\" \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren deadpanned.",

        "content": "When it comes to doing things, Elizabeth Warren has a plan for everything \u2014 and she\u2019s happy to tell you all about it. But when it comes to paying for things, I'm sorry to say, the Massachusetts senator\u00a0dodges and deflects like a Donald Trump defender. It\u2019s estimated that \"Medicare for All\" will cost the federal government an extra $3 trillion a year.\u00a0That\u2019s more than $9,000 annually from every man, woman and child in America.\u00a0Despite being asked, again and again, Warren refuses to acknowledge that paying for this is going to require an across-the-board tax increase\u00a0\u2014 and a pretty massive one, at that. Instead, she keep talking about how \u201ccosts\u201d will go down\u00a0before she changes the subject to how stressful it is to have your insurance canceled when you get sick or when you have to cope with your mom having diabetes. That\u2019s very true, I\u2019m sure. But we\u2019re talking fiscal policy here. There\u2019s a very unpleasant collectivist feel to this. It\u2019s all very well to say you can\u2019t make an omelet\u00a0without breaking some eggs \u2026 unless you\u2019re the egg. About\u00a056% of Americans \u2014 more than 180 million \u2014\u00a0have private health insurance through an employer. Medicare for All would sweep that all away, whether the people who have that insurance like it or not, in the name of the common good. Perhaps worse, as Warren knows perfectly well but steadfastly refuses to admit, there are going to be winners and losers. Costs might\u00a0go down in the aggregate, but individuals and families aren\u2019t aggregates. Elizabeth Warren's choice:\u00a0'Medicare for All' purity or a path to beating Trump? For example, Warren keeps saying that the total you pay for health care would end up being less under Medicare for All because it will eliminate out-of-pocket costs like premiums and copays. That\u2019s an oversimplification at best, especially since she hasn\u2019t said how she would finance this enormously expensive project. But it is a given that everyone will pay higher taxes, and it\u2019s older people who spend more in premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs \u2014 a lot more. Consequently, older people will be far more likely to see these higher taxes offset by a decrease in the cost of their health care. By contrast, younger people and families at healthier stages of their lives would still be paying new taxes\u00a0but will see fewer benefits. On average, would people be better off with lower taxes and more disposable income to buy a home, invest, or raise a family when they were younger and then absorb higher health care costs when they are older? Or would they be better off forgoing that income and avoiding those health care costs later? I don\u2019t know, and neither does Sen.\u00a0Warren. But this is exactly the kind of thing we need to have an open and honest debate about. Warren is treating the American public like children and insisting that she knows best. This is foolish in the extreme. Even if she doesn\u2019t want to discuss the costs and trade-offs of Medicare for All, she can be sure that, should she become the Democratic nominee, the Republicans will do it for her. Her refusal to admit the obvious makes her look dishonest. Doing it wrong: 2020 Democrats, stop arguing about health care and show leadership. Medicare for All is not a good idea. It\u2019s just an idea. It\u2019s up to the American people, after considering the pros and cons \u2014 which, yes, do include much higher taxes for everyone \u2014 to decide whether, on balance, the trade-offs make it worthwhile or whether something else, like an expanded and fortified Obamacare or a public insurance option, would be better. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, is exactly correct when he says that Americans want choices,\u00a0and that we should trust them to make the right decisions for themselves, for their families \u2014 and for the country. You do that by being straight with them. There are\u00a0many possible paths to beating Donald Trump in 2020, but I can guarantee you that trying to out-spin and out-dodge him is not one of them.

Employees for the company learned last week that a $200,000 order of bedroom furniture was placed by BCFS for a facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas,\u00a0the Boston Globe first reported. Friday, nearly 550 employees on Friday signed a letter to Wayfair\u00a0executives asking that the company\u00a0cease all business with contractors that operate detention camps for immigrants. \"We believe that the current actions of the United States and their contractors at the Southern border do not represent an ethical business partnership Wayfair should choose to be a part of,\u201d the letter stated, according to the Globe, which obtained a copy of the letter.\u00a0\u201cAt Wayfair, we believe that \u2018everyone should live in a home that they love.\u2019 Let\u2019s stay true to that message by taking a stand against the reprehensible practice of separating families, which denies them any home at all.\" The walkout is set for Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. local time in Boston, the Washington Post reported. In addition, employees are calling on Wayfair to donate all profits made from the sale to BCFS to Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, a Texas-based non-profit that provides legal services to immigrants.

A Twitter account\u00a0about\u00a0the walkout was created, as well as a Facebook page. Wayfair and the organizers of the walkout have not responded to requests for comment. Another Democratic lawmaker\u00a0has also responded to the media reports about the planned\u00a0walkout. Rep.

        "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013 President Donald Trump said he would jettison a proposal to slash funding for the Special Olympics, undercutting Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and the budget proposal he signed. \"The Special Olympics will be funded. I just told my people I want to fund the Special Olympics,\" Trump said\u00a0he left the White House en route to a political rally in Grand Rapids, Mich. \"I have overridden my people. We're funding the Special Olympics.\" Trump's remarks came after\u00a0widespread criticism targeted\u00a0DeVos' budget proposal to eliminate funding for the program,\u00a0which is designed to help children and adults with disabilities. DeVos\u2019 proposed $17.6 million cut for the Special Olympics was included in the $4.75 trillion\u00a0federal budget\u00a0that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration sent to Congress earlier this month. Trump, in his comments on Thursday, offered no additional information about whether his administration will commit to funding the entire $17.6 million Special Olympics had been getting and whether it will be protected from future proposed reductions. After Trump made the announcement, DeVos thanked the president and said they see \"eye to eye\" on this, adding she pushed him to change his stance on funding the program. More:Five things to know about the federal budget process More:Betsy DeVos wants to cut Special Olympics $$ and people are outraged: What we know now Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence, also voiced her support after Trump's remarks, saying on\u00a0Twitter: \u00a0\"Love the @SpecialOlympics!\" Karen Pence led the U.S. delegation to this year's Special Olympics World Games in the United Arab Emirates. It is not just Special Olympics facing the budget ax. Trump seeks dramatic across-the-board spending cuts to domestic programs for the coming fiscal year. An exception: the military, which would get a 5 percent increase under his proposal. \u201cGet rid of the fat, get rid of the waste,\u201d Trump had instructed his Cabinet. DeVos, however, proposed additional funding for a few programs, including charter schools and\u00a0a tax credit for individuals and companies\u00a0that donate to scholarships for private schools. DeVos said she had to make some hard decisions after the president demanded across-the-board cuts and has had to defend her cuts to members of Congress, where she's faced days of being grilled. Earlier Thursday,\u00a0DeVos\u2014a wealthy Republican donor and former school choice advocate\u2014was on Capitol Hill again defending the proposed cut to the Special Olympics to a Senate Appropriations subcommittee. During that hearing, she sharply criticized comments on the proposed cut by U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., as a \"shameful\" and \"disgusting\" political ploy. \"I've given a portion of my salary to Special Olympics,\" said DeVos, raising her voice as Durbin tried to interrupt her with more questions about the cut. \"Let's not use disabled children in a twisted way for your political narrative. That's just disgusting and is shameful.\" Durbin responded that proposing to eliminate\u00a0$18 million out of a $64-billion Education Department budget for something as beloved as Special Olympics \"is shameful, too.\" He added that whoever approved the proposed cut should get \"a\u00a0special Olympic gold medal for insensitivity.\" More:'Get rid of the fat': Why Betsy DeVos' plan to slash Special Olympics funding probably won't happen More:Betsy DeVos: Special Olympics questions from Congress are 'disgusting' The education secretary has explained her rationale by saying the Special Olympics is a private organization \u2013 not a federal program \u2013 that is better supported by philanthropy. The cuts have not gone into effect yet and did not have a strong chance of passing in Congress. The budget is just a proposal, a way for the Trump administration to spell out its spending priorities for the coming year. Trump\u2019s budget was basically dead\u00a0the moment it arrived at\u00a0Congress. And, given the political support that the Special Olympics has in Congress, there's virtually no chance that lawmakers will let the proposed cuts to the program stand.

Mueller also warned that Russia is planning to interfere in the 2020 election \"as we sit here.\" Also on Friday, Washington Post opinion columnist Dana Milbank wrote a piece titled \"Mitch McConnell is a Russian asset,\" in which he said McConnell's actions are \"unpatriotic\" and that the \"Kentucky Republican is, arguably more than any other American, doing Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s bidding.\" 'Retire Mitch McConnell':A Kentucky farmer, ex-Marine wants to challenge\u00a0McConnell in 2020 US Senate race McConnell spoke with rare outrage Monday afternoon, saying he wanted to clarify things for the \"hyperventilating hacks who haven't actually followed this issue.\" McConnell spoke in frustration about\u00a0Scarborough,\u00a0\"Morning Joe\" and MSNBC, saying\u00a0the show doesn't offer truthful journalism and hosts \"conspiratorial voices.\" \"The host lied and said that I've dismissed Russian interference in our 2016 election as 'a hoax,'\" McConnell said. \"Of course, I've never said any such thing, ever. I've spoken extensively and often about Russia's unacceptable interference in 2016.\" Additionally, McConnell called Milbank's column \"a shameful smear\" that is \"based on more lies.\" \"Mr. Milbank repeatedly claims that I blocked all efforts to raise our defenses against Russian meddling,\" McConnell said. \"The truth is that I've championed and coordinated work between Congress, the administration and the states, which are primarily responsible for our elections.\" Milbank listed several pieces of legislation that he said\u00a0McConnell\u00a0had blocked. However, McConnell claimed\u00a0that he never opposed one of them, though he didn't make clear which one. 'The president is not a racist':Mitch McConnell declines to single out Trump over racist tweets; says 'all of us' should tone down rhetoric \"You'd think a columnist leveling these kind of smears would at least consult a fact-checker before accusing an elected official of aiding and abetting Vladimir Putin,\" McConnell said. \"But, alas, it's not even a competent hit piece. Just sloppy work.\" In all, McConnell addressed the Senate for about 20 minutes. He finished his remarks by circling back to McCarthyism, stating that Putin and Russians are trying to invoke fear in America and that mainstream media pundits are helping to perpetuate it. \"If anything is an asset to the Russians, it is disgusting behavior like that,\" McConnell said. McCarthyism refers to the 1950s\u00a0campaign by former Sen.\u00a0Joseph McCarthy to identify alleged Communists in the U.S. government and other institutions at a time when\u00a0tensions were mounting\u00a0between the United States and the then-Soviet Union. MSNBC did not answer a phone call from the Courier Journal. Milbank did not immediately reply to an email. Amy McGrath, who is challenging McConnell in the 2020 election, tweeted: \"Let's be very clear here: Mitch McConnell is blocking responsible election security measures that the House already passed. No matter how much he complains from his perch on the Senate floor, that\u2019s the reality of the situation.\" McConnell family benefited from slavery:In McConnell\u2019s boyhood town where his family owned slaves, the reparations debate thrives Follow Ben Tobin on Twitter @TobinBen.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Dozens of donors enjoyed a white-tablecloth dinner, an open bar and sweeping views of the U.S. Capitol this month when Elizabeth Warren strode on stage to headline a Democratic National Committee fundraiser. The setting was similarly swanky in August, when Warren addressed party contributors at the ornate Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. And it's likely to be much the same in December, when Warren is slated to headline another party fundraiser in Boston. The Massachusetts senator\u00a0has become a leading Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0in part because she has pledged to forgo events with high-dollar donors, which has resonated with progressives who believe wealthy donors have outsized political influence. But Warren has a notable exception for fundraisers that take in big money for her party, a practice she plans to continue if she becomes the Democratic nominee to take on President Donald Trump. Warren is already under scrutiny for seeding\u00a0her presidential campaign\u00a0with money she raised while running for the Senate, when she spent millions of dollars on fundraisers and took money from large donors. While that's common practice, the money transfers and the fundraisers for the national party committee could undermine Warren's image as a relentless fighter for the middle class who would rather spend hours taking selfies with supporters than schmoozing with elite donors. USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll:Biden's lead over Warren narrows in a turbulent Democratic field The list:Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide \"She's a great candidate,\" said Don Fowler, who ran the DNC for two years under President Bill Clinton and hasn't endorsed any of his party's White House hopefuls. \"She's just off-step on this particular point.\" Fowler and other Democratic leaders say Warren isn't being honest about her fundraising plans if she were to become the party's nominee. They say she can't tell voters she is personally shunning big-dollar fundraisers while simultaneously headlining state and national party events at which she would raise millions of dollars from major donors supporting her bid for the White House. \"What I hope she understands is that after a candidate becomes the nominee, the DNC is their campaign and their campaign is the DNC,\" said Rufus Gifford, Barack Obama's 2012 finance chairman. \"There is not a distinction that you can draw.\" Bernie Sanders, Warren's chief rival for the most liberal wing of the Democratic Party, also is shunning large-dollar fundraisers in the primary. He hasn't headlined a party fundraiser, but his campaign says he would attend such events in the general election as long as they are grassroots driven and open to low-dollar donors. Warren's campaign said it hasn't made final decisions on how she would conduct party fundraisers as the nominee. Raising money for the party will be an especially urgent task in 2020. Whoever wins the primary will inherit a party that is $7 million in debt and has been outraised almost 5-to-1 by Trump and the Republican National Committee, which pulled in more than $300 million this year alone. Warren has struggled to explain how she would balance her opposition to big-dollar events against her plans to raise money for the party. \"I will help the party,\" Warren said while campaigning in South Carolina last weekend. \"I am not going to ask Democrats to unilaterally disarm in the face of an onslaught of money.\" She gave a different explanation weeks earlier in an interview with CBS. \"I will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money,\" she said while railing against politicians \"going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible.\" Warren campaign spokesman Chris Hayden says she's avoided special VIP receptions at DNC events, keeping with Warren's \"no special access\" for big donors pledge. He noted that her past fundraising bolstered Democratic candidates across the country. No decisions have been made, he said, about how she would handle large sums pouring into the party from fundraisers if she becomes the nominee. So far, Warren's 2020 strategy of shunning donors appears to be working. She raised\u00a0nearly $25 million during the third quarter\u00a0and touts a grassroots operation that yielded a $26 average donation during that period. She's repeatedly slammed rivals including former Vice President Joe Biden for relying on big-dollar donors to fund his 2020 presidential campaign and reversing his past opposition to outside money backing his candidacy. More:Following debate criticism, Elizabeth Warren will outline how to pay for 'Medicare for All' plan But as recently as last year, Warren spent considerable time and money cultivating relationships with the very same types of donors she now derides. Since her election to the Senate in 2012, Warren has spent more than $2.6 million holding fundraisers and used some of the proceeds to seed her presidential run, which she got off the ground with a $10.4 million transfer from her Senate campaign account, according to an analysis of records by The Associated Press. Over the years, she spent more than $1.6 million on fundraising consulting, nearly $500,000 on catering for fundraisers and at least $67,000 renting out event spaces, the AP's analysis found. That includes $43,000 spent at the four-star Charles Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Warren lives, $38,000 at the five-star Fairmount Copley Plaza Hotel and almost $20,000 at City Winery, both in nearby Boston. Last year was one of Warren's top-spending years. She dropped $546,000 on fundraising while campaigning for reelection and laying the groundwork for her presidential run, records show. During that period she attended fundraisers hosted by Silicon Valley donor Karla Jurvetson, tech entrepreneur Stephen M. Silberstein, former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and Stephen Cozen, the head of Cozen O'Connor, a Philadelphia law firm that reported making $2.1 million in lobbying fees in 2018, records show. Rendell, who has helped Biden raise money for his presidential campaign, said he co-chaired the Warren fundraiser while she sought Senate reelection last year and donated $4,500. He said Warren sent him a handwritten thank you note then but slammed him and other past donors after they attended an April fundraiser for Biden. \"She attacked us, and I think 22 of us had given the maximum to her the year before at a swanky party in a swanky restaurant,\" Rendell said. \"We were called bundlers and access-seekers and all sorts of names by Elizabeth, including me. And I'm not a rich guy. For me, giving $4,500 is a lot of money.\" Associated Press writer Bill Barrow in Rock Hill, S.C., contributed to this report.",

A day after a U.S. diplomat told lawmakers his staff overheard the president pressing for a Ukrainian investigation into his rivals\u00a0\u2013 a bombshell revelation the president has denied\u00a0\u2013 Trump was hoping to turn the tide in Louisiana's razor-thin race for governor. Trump\u00a0has not scheduled any additional\u00a0rallies through the remainder of the year. Speaking in\u00a0Bossier City, Louisiana, at his first campaign rally since public hearings began Wednesday in the Democratic-led inquiry, Trump claimed that the impeachment hearings were helping his reelection effort. Trump's campaign said Thursday it had raised more than $3 million in the 24 hours after the hearing. \"The people of this country aren't buying it \u2013 you see it because we're going up and they're going down,\" Trump said. \"Let's keep it going for a while.\" Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the loyalty of Republican lawmakers in recent weeks, said the GOP is now sticking together, and\u00a0\"it's a beautiful thing.\" Trump also mocked\u00a0State Department official George Kent\u00a0and\u00a0Ambassador Bill Taylor, the first witnesses to testify in the public hearings, suggesting they didn't have an answer for why what they were describing is an impeachable offense. \"And they stood there and went like, 'what?'\" In fact,\u00a0Kent and Taylor, who have served presidents of both parties, repeatedly said that they would not make a determination about whether Trump's actions were impeachable because that was a job for members of the House. Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, will testify Friday. Yovanovitch was recalled from Ukraine in May amid criticism in conservative media that she was an Obama holdover. Yovanovitch has, in fact,\u00a0served presidents of both parties. Stung by Kentucky Gov.

John Bel Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff election. Trump touched on the Kentucky race briefly, pointing to other GOP wins in that state and in Mississippi. He told the crowd that Bevin, who conceded the race Thursday, would have performed worse without his involvement. \"You gotta give me a big win please,\" Trump told the crowd. \"Please.\" More:How to stay updated on USA TODAY's impeachment coverage Trump's Louisiana rally could be his last of 2019; his long-range schedule, including holidays at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida,\u00a0does not currently include additional political rallies, though he could always add them later. Trump did not mention Thursday\u2019s deadly school shooting in California during his remarks, though he did tweet his condolences to the victims en route to the event. Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, told lawmakers Wednesday was that\u00a0one of his aides overheard a July 26 phone call between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, in which the president inquired about \"the investigations\" he had been pressing\u00a0Zelensky to open. Trump had requested Zelensky investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been\u00a0under investigation, as well as alleged Ukrainian interference in\u00a0the 2016 presidential election. The president told reporters Wednesday that he did not recall that conversation. \"First time I've\u00a0heard it,\" Trump said. \"I don\u2019t recall. Not at all.

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013\u00a0President Barack Obama has\u00a0a message for\u00a0Democrats regarding 2020: chill out. Speaking at a fundraiser in California, the former president attempted to address anxieties over the crowded field of candidates, saying, \u201cEveryone needs to chill\u00a0out about the candidates, but gin up about the prospect of rallying behind whoever emerges from this process.\u201d Democratic debate: Here are the winners and losers from the November stage His comments come days after he advised \"politically woke\" young people not to be so judgmental, and for Democrats to be \"rooted in reality.\" \"The average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it\u2019s important for us not to lose sight of that,\" Obama said last Friday. His latest message comes one day after 10 Democratic candidates took the stage in Atlanta for the fifth primary debate. Overall, there are still 17 candidates in the race.\u00a0Former Massachusetts Governor Patrick Deval made a late entry when he announced last week he was running. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has also teased the idea. Here's the real Democratic debate: Which one can defeat Donald Trump? Obama continued to warn donors to remember that \"flaws are magnified\" during primaries and debates. \"There will be differences,\u201d among the candidates\u00a0he reiterated, but that they are \"relatively minor\" compared to beating Trump. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to defeat a president and a party that has, I think, taken a sharp turn away from a lot of the core traditions and values and institutional commitments that built this country,\u201d he stated. He continued to note the diversity of the 2020 field of candidates, saying, \"We have a number of women candidates, and we have one gay candidate, and those candidates will have barriers if they win the nomination, just like I did,\" nodding at the fact that he was the first African American to win a major party's nomination, and then later, the presidency. \"The field will narrow and there's going to be one person and if that is not your perfect candidate and there are certain aspects of what they say that you don't agree with and\u00a0you don't find them completely inspiring the way you'd like, I don't care. The choice is so stark,\" Obama stated bluntly when\u00a0comparing the potential candidate against President Donald Trump. Tickets for the Silicon\u00a0Valley event, which benefitted the DNC's Democratic Unity Fund,\u00a0ranged from $10,000 to $355,000, with the\u00a0highest-paying donors attending a \"VIP reception\" with Obama. Other attendees for the event included Golden State Warriors player Steph Curry and his wife, actress Ayesha Curry.",

        "content": "No, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is not a racist. Yes, she has been an ally of women of color for her entire 31-year career in Congress. I have seen her up close and personal, when she spoke at\u00a0an event my Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority held last year in Washington, D.C. at the Library of Congress to honor a historic black woman. She is all in on black women\u2019s advancement and policy issues. To argue otherwise would be untrue. Yet\u00a0freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\u00a0has it right \u2014 Speaker Pelosi is old guard. She does not like her new, high-profile women of color members nipping at her heels. She paid her dues. She worked her way up through the male dominated congressional system for decades to become the nation\u2019s first female Speaker of the House. The daughter of a powerful Baltimore Mayor, Pelosi was raised in the 1950s and came of age in the early 1960s. She remembers a time when women were like \"Leave it to Beaver\u201d or \u201cFather Knows Best\u201d moms, known for their pearls and perfectly coiffed hair. Pelosi remembers an America where women were largely silent, and could advance in politics, but only through steady party loyalty, staying in their place, waiting their turn, and never running their mouths to the media. This is Pelosi\u2019s formation as a politician and to a large degree as a person. Enter New York\u2019s 29-year-old \"AOC,\u201d a\u00a0she is known, and her Democratic colleagues Rep.\u00a0Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Rep.\u00a0Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. These bold, young women of color \u2014 unbought and unbossed in the spirit of the late Rep. Shirley Chisholm \u2014 have turned the Democratic caucus on its head. They are unafraid to speak out, to call out, and demand the change that we are so often asked to delay or deny as women of color. The current tensions erupted\u00a0after\u00a0the four women opposed a border spending\u00a0bill they said failed to protect migrant children from President Donald Trump's policies. Pelosi criticized them\u00a0 in\u00a0interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, the women fought back, and AOC\u00a0told\u00a0the\u00a0Washington Post that Pelosi had been \"outright disrespectful.\" She accused her of \"the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.\" The issue here is NOT that Pelosi is a racist. In fact, Trump's Twitter attack Sunday\u00a0on \u201c'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen\" and his suggestion that they \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\" drew a strong defense of the four women from Pelosi, who called his comments xenophobic and evidence that he wanted to make America \"white again.\" No, the real issue here is what we academics call \u201cintersectionality\"\u00a0\u2014 the combined impact of racism, sexism and other types of discrimination on people and groups. In practice, it means that white women in power often take on the same characteristics of white men in power toward women of color. Last straw:\u00a0'I think I'd take it'?\u00a0Nancy Pelosi, it's time to impeach Trump. The effect on women of color is widespread.\u00a0White women earn 77\u00a0cents on the dollarcompared to white men. Hispanic or Latina women earn 53 cents on\u00a0the dollar. Black or African-American women earn 61 cents. White women have made notable advancements in industry, politics, academia and corporate America, whereas women of color make up only about 5% of corporate executives and there is only one woman of color heading a Fortune 500 company. In\u00a0medical schools,\u00a0law schools\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0law firms, while\u00a0women overall\u00a0have achieved parity or better,\u00a0women of color lag far behind.\u00a0I could go on and on with data points, but that is not the issue at hand. When you need Trump to defend you as not being a racist, you must stop and consider why. What do I mean?\u00a0On Friday, Trump told reporters that AOC had been \"very disrespectful\" to Pelosi. \"I don't think that Nancy can let that go on,\" he added. What the heck? What Trump really meant to say is that older white people like him, Biden, and yes, Pelosi, simply do not yet know how to deal with women of color being in power and holding their feet to the fire. Pelosi tough:\u00a0Donald Trump caved to Nancy Pelosi on shutdown, now the wall will never be built Black women are deemed \u201cangry.\u201d Latina women are deemed fiery. And Muslim women are \u201cradical.\u201d These words often used to describe us are meant to marginalize and silence us. The solution here is not for Speaker Pelosi to silence AOC or condemn her. It is to listen and learn and find a way to work together. This is not Congress in 1978, 1988 or 1998. This is 2019. People of color have a voice. Women of color have a voice. These women are members of the United States Congress. These women of color have a national platform that empowers them and indeed demands of them that they speak up for themselves and their constituents. Sophia A.

His loan balance \u2013 which had been nearly $35,000\u00a0\u2013 had been\u00a0reduced to zero. After nine months of phone calls, chasing down paperwork\u00a0\u2013 and even getting his senator involved\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it was\u00a0the confirmation he was hoping for: The Department of Education\u00a0was\u00a0forgiving\u00a0his student loans under a program to help people who work in public service jobs. Cuciak is\u00a0one of a lucky few. Federal data released this week show\u00a0that 41,000 people applied under the new Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. As of Sept. 30, only 206 had received it. That success rate\u00a0\u2013 just 0.5 percent of borrowers who apply\u00a0\u2013 has frustrated applicants, student advocates and\u00a0consumer groups, who say borrowers made education and career decisions based on the government's promise that their loans would be forgiven. \"It\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not working\u00a0and that public servants who thought they had a deal aren't getting the benefit of that deal,\" said Daniel Zibel, vice president of the National Student Legal Defense Network. More:Just 0.5 percent of public service worker applicants are getting their student loans forgiven. Here's how you can be one of them The\u00a0College Cost Reduction and Access Act\u00a0of\u00a02007\u00a0allows the government to forgive\u00a0student loans for graduates who commit to work in\u00a0public service: military, law enforcement,\u00a0education, social\u00a0work,\u00a0public health and\u00a0other fields. Many jobs in\u00a0those professions require advanced degrees\u00a0but pay\u00a0modest salaries\u00a0to start. After working\u00a010 years in a qualifying profession and\u00a0making 120 loan payments on time, many of those borrowers thought their loans would be forgiven. When the first cohort of borrowers started applying in October\u00a02017\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a decade\u00a0after\u00a0the law\u00a0took effect\u00a0\u2013 many learned that they had the wrong kind of loan\u00a0or the wrong repayment plan. Opinion:Feds say they'll forgive your student loan, but almost no one actually benefits The Department of Education would not answer questions about the program on the record. Liz Hill, spokeswoman for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, sent USA TODAY a written statement that the department is \"committed to helping borrowers navigate this complex program.\" \"The Department has faced a challenge in communicating with people directly about PSLF, because we don\u2019t know who they are,\" Hill said.\u00a0The department encourages borrowers to submit an\u00a0Employment Certification Form every year to make sure they're on track. The Trump administration wants to get rid of the program\u00a0and replace it\u00a0with an income-driven repayment program that would reduce loan payments based on salary and family size. \"We think that will help students that heretofore haven't been able to pursue higher ed\u00a0in a longer-term, meaningful way,\" DeVos told a Senate committee in June.\u00a0\"We're focused on finding ways to make sure that students that are most in need of these opportunities are able to access them and then have good options for the back end in repaying.\" Cuciak, a mental health and substance abuse counselor in suburban Columbus, Ohio, didn't make his career choice based on the\u00a0loan forgiveness\u00a0program. It\u00a0didn't exist\u00a0when he went to graduate school. But one reason he\u00a0stayed\u00a0in a job at a community-based counseling service,\u00a0he said,\u00a0was\u00a0the hope of loan forgiveness. The work\u00a0\"was what I felt called to do,\" Cuciak\u00a0said. \"But when I had opportunities to look at other options in my career, that was a factor. There was this promise.\" Then Cuciak learned he had the wrong kind of loan. He was on a graduated payment plan. Only income-based and pay-as-you-earn plans were eligible. Congress fixed that problem in March,\u00a0approving $350 million\u00a0to\u00a0temporarily\u00a0expand\u00a0the eligibility criteria to help borrowers on other kinds of payment plans. Previously:Student loan forgiveness program gets $350M one-shot boost to aid struggling borrowers Cuciak was one of\u00a0the borrowers who stood to benefit.\u00a0But even after the new legislation,\u00a0he said, it took months of bureaucracy to get his application approved.  \"There's nobody you can talk to, and you don't know why they\u2019re denying this, and it\u2019s very anxiety-provoking,\" he said. After he called his senator \u2013 Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the Department of Education gave him a dedicated representative to work on his case.\u00a0He learned this month that more than $34,900 in loans would be forgiven. \"I would like to think that being a squeaky wheel makes a difference,\"\u00a0he said. \"I had to do a lot of legwork that I felt like should have been their job. \"It felt as though this has been slow-walked, this whole process. I can't believe that 200 people out of 40,000 actually qualified.\" Neither can\u00a0Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.\u00a0The union joined in lawsuits against student loan servicers and investigations into the Department of Education. \"Betsy DeVos and her friends in the loan servicing industry are breaking that promise and making the program useless,\" Weingarten said. \"The latest numbers confirm just how insidious and flagrant the Department of Education\u2019s mismanagement and industry abuses have become.\" Cuciak, 40,\u00a0recently left his public-sector job for private practice in order to start a family. That $35,000 in forgiveness \u2013 which he estimated would have\u00a0reached\u00a0$45,000 or more with interest over the next 10 years \u2013 will help. \"You could definitely say it was an early Christmas present,\" he said.",

Speaking with NBC News and the Daily Mail,\u00a0Palin, the former vice-presidential candidate, talked about her relationship with the Arizona Republican who is battling terminal brain cancer. McCain's new book, which chronicles his career and bid for president in 2008, reportedly includes his regret with not choosing\u00a0Joe Lieberman, then an independent senator from Connecticut, as his running mate in the 2008 race, which he lost to Barack Obama. McCain writes in the book that advisers counseled him against choosing Lieberman because of his past as a\u00a0Democrat. Palin said she doesn't believe the claim and thinks ghostwriters were behind it. \"I attribute a lot of what we're hearing and reading regarding McCain's statements to his ghostwriter or ghostwriters,\" she told the Daily Mail. \"I don't know all the details of his condition right now.

        "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) took aim at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Saturday, calling the Democratic Party\u2019s reluctance to impeach President Donald Trump a \u201cnational scandal.\u201d \u201cAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior \u2015 it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted late Saturday. The freshman lawmaker\u2019s tweet follows reports that a U.S. intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint last month allegedly involving Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race. House Democrats are looking into whether Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the foreign government to dig up dirt on Biden\u2019s younger son, Hunter, who previously sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, attacking reports from The New York Times and The Washington Post about the matter as \u201cfake news.\u201d Despite the explosive allegations against Trump and the majority of House Democrats publicly supporting the start of an impeachment inquiry, Pelosi has refused to move forward with the process, claiming it would only further divide the country. She also reportedly told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) last week that she doesn\u2019t believe impeachment would pass a vote on the House floor. A representative for Pelosi did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. Ocasio-Cortez and several other progressive House Democrats have repeatedly urged Pelosi for more than a year to pursue impeachment of the president, citing conflicts of interest between Trump\u2019s presidency and his business empire. More Democrats began calling for an impeachment inquiry following Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia report, which outlined several instances of potential obstruction of justice committed by Trump. Nearly all of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), have said they would support the House opening an inquiry. \u201cAfter the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,\u201d Warren tweeted Friday. \u201cBy failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump\u2019s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president.\u201d Biden, who has stated in the past that he agrees with Pelosi\u2019s stance on impeachment, told CBS News on Friday that Trump \u201ccould be impeached\u201d depending on the results of the House\u2019s probe into the whistleblower complaint. \u201cI\u2019m not making that judgment now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe House should investigate.\u201d",

        "content": " Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) took a jab at former President Bill Clinton during a CNN town hall in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday night. The presidential hopeful commented on her past remarks that Bill Clinton should have resigned from his presidency after it was publicly revealed in 1998 that he was having an affair with then-White House intern\u00a0Monica Lewinsky. Moderator Erin Burnett asked Gillibrand if her comments about Bill Clinton ever affected her relationship with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who Gillibrand has openly supported for years. Gillibrand responded cooly, telling Burnett that Hillary Clinton can still be a role model even if her husband is not. \u201cFor me, Secretary Clinton is still a role model for all of us and my views on her husband is very different,\u201d the senator said. \u201cI\u2019ve said all I\u2019m gonna say about that.\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton put that 65 million cracks in that highest and hardest glass ceiling. She\u2019s inspired the world by her bravery and courage to do what she thought was right \u2014 to run for president twice, to be a national leader her whole life. She\u2019s given her life to public service,\u201d Gillibrand said earlier. Gillibrand has been an outspoken advocate for women\u2019s rights and routinely fights for survivors of sexual assault. She sent shockwaves through the Democratic party when she said in November 2017 that it would have been the \u201cappropriate response\u201d for Bill Clinton to step down after his affair with Lewinsky, who was 22 to Bill Clinton\u2019s 49 at the time the relationship took place. Just a month later, Gillibrand made waves again when she was the first Democrat to publicly call for then-Sen. Al Franken\u00a0(D-Minn.) to resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct. During another segment of Tuesday\u2019s town hall, Gillibrand fielded a question about how she plans to fight the stigma surrounding sexual harassment and assault on college campuses, in workplaces and other areas. \u201cI believe deeply that we have to end sexual violence in this country because fundamentally it goes to a very simple question: Do we value women? And unfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of evidence that we don\u2019t,\u201d Gillibrand said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take sexual assault seriously in college campuses, we don\u2019t take it seriously in the military, we don\u2019t even take it seriously in places like Congress,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo we have to address sexual harassment and sexual assault head on.\u201d",

        "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was held in contempt of court by a federal judge on Thursday and ordered to pay a $100,000 fine after wrongly trying to collect on student loans taken out to attend a chain of now-shuttered for-profit colleges. U.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim wrote in her order that there was \u201cno question\u201d that DeVos\u2019 Education Department \u201charmed individual borrowers who were forced to repay loans either through voluntary actions or involuntary methods.\u201d Around 16,000 people were affected by the department\u2019s continued efforts to collect on the loans, even after the judge ordered it to stop. Of those, 1,808 faced wage garnishment or offsets from their tax refunds, and 847 saw their credit scores negatively impacted. The borrowers have since been reimbursed, according to the department. Kim wrote that \u201cthe evidence shows\u201d the department made \u201conly minimal efforts to comply with the preliminary injunction.\u201d The judge had ordered DeVos\u2019 Education Department to stop collecting on the loans in May 2018. After discovering her order had not been followed, Kim issued a sharp rebuke of the department earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m not sending anyone to jail yet, but it\u2019s good to know I have that ability,\u201d the judge said at the time, Politico reported. It is extremely rare for a court to hold a Cabinet secretary in contempt of court, and DeVos is facing fresh calls for her resignation over the issue. Because DeVos is named in the lawsuit in her official capacity as education secretary, the billionaire school-choice activist will not be personally responsible for paying the fine.\u00a0The $100,000 will go toward debt relief promised to former students of Corinthian Colleges, who former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration found were defrauded by the company. Corinthian Colleges, which closed in 2015, was found to have inflated job-placement rates of graduates by counting students who were employed prior to enrollment as successfully placed, and by paying temporary employment agencies to hire graduates. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in the court\u2019s ruling,\u201d the Education Department said in a tweet. \u201cWe acknowledged that servicers made unacceptable mistakes.\u201d",

        "author": "Alanna Vagianos",
        "date": "08/30/2018 06:48 pm ET",
        "content": " Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos\u00a0is expected to propose a controversial set of sexual misconduct rules for schools across the country \u2015 and survivors\u2019 advocates are not happy. DeVos is preparing new Title IX policies that would \u201cbolster the rights of students accused of assault, harassment or rape, reduce liability for institutions of higher education and encourage schools to provide more support for victims,\u201d according to an explosive\u00a0New York Times report\u00a0published Wednesday. The potential new regulations for Title IX (the federal civil rights law created to ensure gender equality in education) include several changes that have advocates up in arms, including narrowing the definition of sexual misconduct and allowing assailants to cross-examine their accusers during the mediation process. Title IX regulations apply to all levels of schooling, but advocates are focusing on universities due to the epidemic of sexual violence that takes place on campuses. \u201cWhat is reflected in the Times article is a tacit endorsement of campuses where it is safer to commit sexual assault than to be a survivor,\u201d Jess Davidson, executive director of the survivor advocacy organization End Rape on Campus, told HuffPost. Almost all of the known proposed regulations would put survivors at risk, but one stands out as particularly alarming. The potential new Title IX guidelines would only hold universities accountable for sexual misconduct that is \u201csaid to have occurred on their campuses,\u201d according to the Times. Title IX advocates and sexual assault survivors agree that this regulation could potentially be disastrous: A whopping 87 percent of college students live off campus. Additionally, many social events take place off campus at bars, Greek life houses, apartment complexes and sports teams\u2019 houses. \u201cThis is really just saying that \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter that you were assaulted three minutes off campus. You still have to share a classroom with your rapist. And you don\u2019t have any rights,\u2019\u201d\u00a0Sage Carson, manager of the anti-sexual violence organization Know Your IX, told HuffPost. \u201cTitle IX is not meant to be focused on where the assault occurred but how that violence is impacting someone\u2019s education. And the impact of that doesn\u2019t change depending on where you were assaulted,\u201d Carson continued. \u201cThis was a really clear message that DeVos just doesn\u2019t understand the point of Title IX at all.\u201d Although Title IX is best known as a broad tool to combat gender discrimination in education, it also provides\u00a0important protections\u00a0for survivors of sexual assault,\u00a0including\u00a0the right to an investigation and the ability to change class schedules so as not to interact with an assailant. Davidson, who has previously blogged for HuffPost, said she was \u201cabsolutely outraged\u201d by the off-campus provision. \u201cWhether or not your assault happened in a campus facility or an off-campus facility \u2015\u00a0students deserve just as much access to their Title IX rights as any other student,\u201d she said. Sejal Singh, policy coordinator for Know Your IX, brought up the sexual abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor accused of sexually abusing hundreds of athletes. \u201cWould it make sense for Larry Nassar not to be held accountable if he only abused student athletes at off-campus events?\u201d\u00a0Singh said. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd.\u201d Not only would this proposed rule ignore the rampant sexual violence that often takes place at fraternity and athletes\u2019 houses, it would likely further isolate marginalized students who commute to campus. \u201cWhen you look at community colleges and commuter colleges \u2015 this guideline would prevent marginalized students from having their claims considered,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cEspecially when it\u2019s already more difficult to report sexual assault if you are a student from a variety of historically underserved backgrounds.\u201d As a Title IX coordinator and sexual assault survivor herself, Taylor Parker knows just how dangerous the off-campus provision could be. \u201cA lot of assaults happen at off-campus parties,\u201d Parker told HuffPost. \u201cIf off-campus misconduct creates a hostile learning environment on campus, then this provision completely misses the point of what a civil rights law is attempting to accomplish.\u201d \u201cI feel like my government has basically abandoned me,\u201d she added. Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill told The New York Times that the department is \u201cin the midst of a deliberative process,\u201d saying the proposed regulations obtained by the paper are \u201cpremature and speculative.\u201d DeVos, however, has been on a mission to overhaul the Obama-era Title IX guidelines and regulations since she was confirmed\u00a0last year. In 2017, DeVos met with people \u201cwrongly accused\u201d of sex crimes (a group consisting mainly of so-called men\u2019s rights activists) and, not long after, rescinded an Obama-era Title IX guideline called \u201cThe Dear Colleague Letter.\u201d Title IX advocates and survivors told HuffPost they\u2019re prepared to fight, and other supporters should be too. \u201cThis policy actually can be stopped,\u201d Davidson said. The Department of Education will likely release a final proposed Title IX regulation in the next few days or weeks. Legally, the department is required to consider all comments from the public before making a decision. \u201cEveryone has the opportunity to stop this from happening, but we absolutely have to participate and comment,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually one of the best opportunities we\u2019ve ever had to stop something created by the Trump administration in its tracks.\u201d Need help?

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) over their competing health care plans, writing in an essay Tuesday that she was taking a dangerous \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d approach to the issue. In a post on Medium, the Democratic presidential hopeful also zeroed in on comments his rival made last week that he was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary\u201d and \u201crepeating Republican talking points\u201d by criticizing her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan. Warren\u2019s proposal is bolder and more progressive than Biden\u2019s, but also more expensive. \u201cThe other day I was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary. Pretty amazing. On one level, it is kind of funny,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cBut at another level these kinds of attacks are a serious problem,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn\u2019t agree with you \u2014 it\u2019s not just that you disagree \u2014 that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.\u201d Biden, who pitches himself as more able to win over moderate voters in crucial swing states than Warren or the other major contenders in the Democratic race, emphasized throughout the piece that Warren\u2019s comment \u201cis no way to bring the country together. This is no way for this party to beat Donald Trump\u201d in next year\u2019s presidential election. Warren\u2019s remarks came after Biden\u2019s campaign launched an attack on her Medicare for All plan, accusing her campaign of using \u201cmathematical gymnastics\u201d to hide that its $21 trillion cost would require tax increases on the middle class. Biden, by contrast, is proposing an expansion of former President\u00a0Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and allowing people to keep their private insurance if they want to. The two will face off over health care and other issues more at a Nov. 20 debate alongside that also will feature at least seven other candidates.",

        "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Republicans are apoplectic about Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, calling it a shameful betrayal of the Kurds to a deadly Turkish invasion that could lead to a resurgence of the Islamic State in the Middle East. But ask them what Congress \u2015 an independent institution charged with oversight of the executive branch \u2015 ought to do to remedy the situation, and they scratch their heads, unable to come up with an answer. \u201cIt\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s such a big problem right now, it\u2019s going to take some time to unravel what the next step should be,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Wednesday. Even Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), one of Trump\u2019s biggest critics who called the situation in Syria a \u201cvery dark moment in American history,\u201d struggled to name a solution. \u201cWe\u2019ve created an extraordinary mess, and the path forward is certainly unclear,\u201d Romney told reporters on Capitol Hill. On the table is a bipartisan sanctions bill introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) that would unleash a series of economic sanctions against Turkey for its incursion into Syria, where a number of human rights violations have been reported following Trump\u2019s decision to effectively greenlight the invasion by pulling U.S. troops out of northern Syria. It\u2019s not clear, however, how much support there is for such a bill, nor whether it would prove effective. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has notably not committed to bringing it to the floor for a vote. Nor has the Kentucky Republican said whether he\u2019ll allow a vote on a nonbinding bipartisan, bicameral resolution opposing Trump\u2019s Syria policy that passed in the House on Wednesday by a 354-60 vote. \u201cTurkey is a NATO ally, and we don\u2019t want to totally fracture our relationship with them. We don\u2019t want to further drive them into the arms of the Russians,\u201d McConnell said at a weekly news conference Wednesday. Though McConnell voiced support for the Kurds and expressed his hope that a Thursday trip by Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Turkey \u201ccan somehow repair the damage\u201d in the region, he made no remarks during an explosive meeting with Trump and other top congressional lawmakers at the White House on Wednesday afternoon. During that discussion in the Cabinet Room, Trump berated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) after she spoke out against the president\u2019s handling of the Syria crisis. Trump, according to Pelosi, had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d and offered no strategy for dealing with the situation going forward. Only two Republicans spoke in the meeting: Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas. Earlier Wednesday, Trump further undermined the long-standing alliance between U.S. and Kurdish forces who have been fighting alongside each other against ISIS in Syria. The president said that the Kurds are \u201cnot angels\u201d and that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria is \u201cnot our problem.\u201d The Trump administrations\u2019 abrupt foreign policy shift in the Middle East has brought bipartisan backlash from lawmakers, including top Trump ally Graham. The South Carolina Republican warned Trump was committing the \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency\u201d by abandoning the Kurds, but he held out hope that Trump might yet correct course on Syria. \u201cI fear this is a complete and utter national security disaster in the making, and I hope President Trump will adjust his thinking,\u201d Graham tweeted Wednesday. Democrats, meanwhile, were skeptical that Republicans might take more drastic action in seeking to force Trump to alter course in the Middle East.\u00a0As chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, for example, Graham could hold up the president\u2019s nominations to federal courts as leverage over the president. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee could also hold hearings into the matter. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely to happen. Come on. Take a look around,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.",

During Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Sondland explained that he believed there was a quid pro quo at play between Ukraine and Trump, meaning that Ukrainians had to respond\u00a0to Trump\u2019s requests to get a White House call or meeting. As if the testimony weren\u2019t enough of a bombshell, about two thirds of the way through, Sondland mentioned a popular rapper by name and sent social media into a tailspin. Sondland described a call he had with Trump on July 26, 2019. The ambassador was in Kyiv at the time and stated that he and the president did not discuss any classified information at that time. In clarifying what the call entailed, Sondland said: \u201cOther witnesses have recently shared their recollection of overhearing this call. For the most part, I have no reason to doubt their accounts. It is true that the president speaks loudly at times. And it\u2019s also true, I think we primarily discussed A$AP Rocky. It is true that the President likes to use colorful language.\u201d The ambassador goes on to say that the call did not strike him as \u201csignificant.\u201d Naturally, hearing a name like A$AP Rocky \u2015 the artist behind hits like \u201cF**kin\u2019 Problems\u201d and \u201cLive Fast\u201d \u2015 during an impeachment inquiry is a bit ... jarring. The rapper was detained in Sweden after being charged with assault in July. At the time, Trump\u00a0\u201coffered to personally vouch for [Rocky\u2019s] bail,\u201d though Sweden has no bail system. On Wednesday, Sondland doubled down on the mention of the 31-year-old artist and said later in his testimony that his memory of the July 26 call with Trump was triggered by someone\u2019s reference to A$AP Rocky. He claimed that discussing the rapper was the \u201cprimary purpose of the call.\u201d  Here\u2019s what the peanut gallery, AKA Twitter, had to say about the mentions:",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said Friday while testifying on family separations and the treatment of migrants. \u201cChildren are being separated from their families in front of an American flag,\u201d the congresswoman told the House Oversight Committee as she fought back tears. \u201cWe cannot allow for this.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, a fierce critic of the Trump administration, was among four Democratic members of Congress to testify before fellow lawmakers about what they saw during visits to the border. They described seeing migrants covered in filth from an inability to shower or change, with canker sores from unhealthy food, and only thin blankets for sleeping on concrete. They called on Congress to act as migrants report overcrowded facilities and little access to care or medication. The Trump administration has blamed the number of undocumented immigrants arriving at the border \u2015 which dipped last month but hit record numbers earlier this year \u2015 on loose immigration laws, demanding more funding, a border wall and legal changes to restrict access to asylum. But the Democrats argued the administration has exacerbated the crisis through its policies, including the family separations it carried out last year. Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), who represents a district on the border with Mexico, also testified at the hearing. \u201cThis is not a matter of resources, but a matter of will,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have the power to change this. Do we have the will?\u201d She called her city, El Paso, \u201ca modern day Ellis Island.\u201d Volunteers there have helped migrants for years. Over the last year, they have ramped up efforts to feed, shelter and care for the thousands of migrant families released weekly by the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cMy community, with a fraction of the resources available to the federal government, has responded more strategically, thoughtfully and compassionately than the federal government has,\u201d Escobar said. During testimony from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), she displayed a drawing by a detained child showing people being held in a cell and asked the audience not to look away. Wiping away tears, Tlaib went on to tell the stories of the people she met at various border facilities, including one about a pregnant woman who has since been released. She also noted that 100 Border Patrol agents died by suicide from 2007 to 2018. Family separations were hard on agents as well as migrants, she said. \u201cThe dehumanization is not only with those families, but it\u2019s also with the agents that we\u2019ve told to do this to these families,\u201d Tlaib said. Describing the Trump administration\u2019s current strategy as cruel and intentional, she said it\u2019s \u201cdead set on sending a hate-filled message, that those seeking refuge are not welcome in America. In our America.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said 100 Border Patrol agents had died by suicide between 2017 and 2018. The time period was 2007 to 2018.",

        "content": " Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the first Black lawmaker to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol, returned home on Friday to his Baltimore district where family, friends and former presidents gathered to honor his legacy as a proponent of civil rights and government accountability. Cummings\u2019 funeral at the city\u2019s New Psalmist Baptist Church, where he occupied a pew for nearly 40 years, was expected to draw thousands of mourners, including presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who started out the service with a scripture reading of Psalm 23. Former Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was the first to deliver a personal tribute to the late congressman, punctuated by applause as she praised him for having championed \u201ctruth, justice and kindness in every part of his life.\u201d \u201cHe pushed back against the abuse of power, he was unwavering in his defense of our democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cEven his political adversaries recognized that it wasn\u2019t really about politics for our Elijah. He led from his soul.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a Baltimore native, followed Clinton\u2019s speech with a testament to Cummings\u2019 ability to embrace bipartisanship, especially when it came to his work to lower prescription drug pricing. \u201cElijah brought people together in life of different parties,\u201d she said, noting that in his death, he did the same. \u201cHe was willing to reach across the aisle, even across the Capitol and even down Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama later stepped up to the podium with remembrances of their own, honoring their longtime colleague and friend. Among the most politically poignant speeches was that given by Cummings\u2019 widow, Maryland Democratic Party Chair Dr. Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, who appeared to call out President Donald Trump\u2019s smears of the congressman and his district. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have any challenges like we\u2019ve got going on right now, so his job became harder over time,\u201d she said, referring to Obama\u2019s tenure and adding that her husband was engaged in a \u201cfight for the soul of our democracy against very real corruption.\u201d At the time of his death, the congressman was chairing the House Oversight Committee, helming various probes into potential power abuses by the Trump administration. Evidently, the work provoked the president\u2019s ire. In July, he referred to the congressman\u2019s majority-Black hometown as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d in a racist Twitter rant on which he refused to let up. \u201cI want you all to know that it was not easy,\u201d\u00a0Maya Rockeymoore Cummings said.\u00a0\u201cAnd it got infinitely more difficult in the last months of his life when he sustained personal attacks, and attacks on his beloved city. And while he carried himself with grace and dignity in all public forums, it hurt him.\u201d Elijah Cummings died on Oct. 17 at age 68 after suffering what his office described as \u201ccomplications concerning longstanding health challenges.\u201d Though Maya Rockeymoore Cummings acknowledged that her husband had \u201cdictated every aspect of his service\u201d and would not have wanted to be brought to the Capitol on Thursday, she felt \u201cvery strongly that they were trying to tear him down, and we needed to make sure that he went out with the respect and the dignity that he deserved.\u201d",

        "content": " BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s presidential golf costs have topped $110 million in his 2 1/2 years in office \u2013 more than $4 million more than a conservative group\u2019s estimate for predecessor Barack Obama\u2019s total travel costs over two full terms. Trump arrived at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Friday evening and is scheduled to remain there through Sunday afternoon. It is his 18th golf trip there since taking office. Sunday will mark his 67th day at that course and his 199th day at a golf course he owns. The White House on Saturday did not respond to queries about Trump\u2019s golf activities. Each of the president\u2019s trips to Bedminster costs taxpayers at least $1.1 million in travel and security expenses, according to a HuffPost analysis. Each trip to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida \u2013 of which Trump has made 24 \u2013 costs taxpayers $3.4 million. Since taking office, Trump also has visited his golf resorts in Los Angeles; Doral, Florida; Doonbeg, Ireland; and Turnberry, Scotland \u2015 all on the taxpayer dime. He also has made 64 day trips to his course in northern Virginia. Judicial Watch, a tax-exempt conservative group, in 2017 said that its tally of Obama\u2019s travel costs based on documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act lawsuits had hit $105.7 million. That total, though, appears to include official trips of Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, as well as some campaign-related travel that was partially reimbursed by the Democratic Party. Trump\u2019s $110.3 million total in HuffPost\u2019s analysis is for travel to and from golf vacations, and does not include official or campaign travel. It is based on cost elements derived from a Government Accountability Office report released in January that detailed four Mar-a-Lago trips Trump took just weeks after entering office. Judicial Watch did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment. A review of its web site shows that it remains focused on attacking 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, former FBI director James Comey and former special counsel Robert Mueller. During Obama\u2019s presidency, Trump was a frequent critic of Obama\u2019s golf hobby. \u201cCan you believe that, with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf. Worse than Carter,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in 2014. During his campaign for president, Trump claimed that he would be too busy working to have time for any vacations at all. \u201cI love golf, but if I were in the White House, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see Turnberry again. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see Doral again,\u201d he told a rally audience in February 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t ever think I\u2019d see anything. I just want to stay in the White House and work my ass off.\u201d Instead, Trump has been on the golf course two and a half times as much as Obama was at the same time in his presidency. And, because he insists on playing on his own courses in Florida and New Jersey so much, his golf-related costs to taxpayers are triple that of Obama\u2019s in the same time period. Most of Obama\u2019s golf rounds were played at military bases within motorcade range of the White House, which cost taxpayers relatively little. In contrast, 68% of Trump\u2019s golf days have been at his resorts that require the use of Air Force jets, Marine Corps helicopters, and Air Force transport planes to move his motorcade vehicles. His trips to Mar-a-Lago also require Coast Guard boats and ships to patrol the Atlantic Ocean and Intracoastal Waterway. On his overseas golf outings, the travel footprint is even larger. Trump\u2019s recent trip to Doonbeg, Ireland, for example, cost taxpayers some $3.6 million, even though it involved relatively short flights to and from southern England and northern France.",

        "author": "Daniel Marans",
        "date": "11/12/2019 05:45 am ET",
        "content": " The Center for Popular Democracy Action, an influential network of progressive community organizations, announced Tuesday that it has narrowed down the number of presidential contenders it is considering for an endorsement:\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The political arm of the Center for Popular Democracy, which is composed of 41 groups representing low-income and working-class Black and Latinx people, plans to issue its first-ever presidential endorsement in early December. It will reflect its belief on which candidate inspires low-income voters of color the most and is best equipped to deliver on progressive priorities, such as criminal justice reform, immigration reform, \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and a Green New Deal \u2015 key planks in the organization\u2019s\u00a0federal policy platform. The coalition\u2019s imprimatur is likely to be an asset for candidates in the early primary states of Nevada and California, which are home to several of its member organizations, as well as the general-election battleground states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. \u201cIt was Castro, Warren\u2019s and Bernie\u2019s responses that really struck home for our network and our affiliates,\u201d said Natalia Salgado, political director of CPD Action. \u201cThe core thing, the moral compass for us, throughout this whole process, is our federal platform, which is all of the issues that matter to our affiliates.\u201d CPD Action\u2019s board and staff came up with the shortlist from a wider array of candidates topping the polls at the time of its July conference: former Housing Secretary Castro; Sens. Sanders of Vermont, Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and former Vice President Joe Biden. It graded all eight of the candidates based on their policy positions and their willingness to engage with the organization\u2019s evaluation process. Sanders, Warren and Castro all received an A. Biden and Harris, whom the group claims declined to engage at all, got an F. Booker and Buttigieg received a C, and O\u2019Rourke, who dropped out earlier this month, got a D. Each of the 41 member organizations, which include state affiliates of the immigrant rights group Make the Road, will get a single vote to decide which of the three finalists to endorse. A candidate must obtain a majority of the 41 votes to earn the endorsement, leaving open the remote possibility that the network will not endorse anyone. Even as prominent labor unions with closer ties to the Democratic establishment have been slower to back particular presidential candidates in the 2020 election cycle, newer and more independent progressive groups have been eager to weigh in. The Working Families Party, which shares some of CPD Action\u2019s member organizations, endorsed Warren in September. The blessing provided Warren with something of a shot in the arm since it represented a break with the group\u2019s support for Sanders in the 2016 presidential campaign. The backing of CPD Action could amount to a similar coup for its chosen candidate. For one thing, the network and its member groups have developed a reputation for some of the most pugnacious activism in the liberal landscape, suggesting it would bring considerable grassroots mobilization to its preferred candidate. The network\u2019s Local Progress project created a nationwide progressive caucus for like-minded municipal lawmakers; its Fed Up campaign mounted the first left-leaning movement to pressure the Federal Reserve; and its bird-dogging of senators during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh became a rallying cry for the resistance to Kavanaugh\u2019s elevation. Ady Barkan, the ALS-stricken attorney who conceived of many of the group\u2019s most innovative initiatives, has become one of the country\u2019s best-known and most compelling advocates for Medicare for All. \u201cWe are going to lend all of our political weight to that \u2015 that includes media and digital support. Once we\u2019ve endorsed, we\u2019re going to create an in-state strategy within each state where we\u2019re going to throw down, focus our fundraising on places we think are critical for the candidate to win,\u201d Salgado said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use that network to bring in bodies from noncompetitive states like New York into competitive states.\u201d But more than any one issue or activism tactic, CPD Action plans to amplify the voices of low-income communities of color, which play a marginal role in the earliest stages of the presidential primary process. Iowa and New Hampshire, which host the first-in-the-nation caucus and primaries, respectively, are overwhelmingly white. Liberal activists \u2015 and at least one 2020 candidate, Castro \u2015 have lamented the outsize role the two states have on the nomination process given how unrepresentative they are of the demographics of the country, to say nothing of the diverse Democratic primary electorate. CPD Action\u2019s endorsement is also something of a counterweight to those Democratic campaigns and strategists who progressive activists fear have been insufficiently attentive to the potentially decisive role of increasing Black and Latino turnout in the key states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. They worry instead that Democratic candidates and consultants are focused on catering to the largely white swing voters who backed former President Barack Obama in 2012 and President Donald Trump in 2016 to the exclusion of infrequent voters in communities of color who are more predisposed to back Democrats. \u201cWhat makes us unique in comparison to other organizations is that you have people who are going to have a say in this who live in the most highly incarcerated ZIP code in the country in Milwaukee,\u201d Salgado said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got undocumented workers in Virginia who otherwise aren\u2019t legally allowed to vote but are going to have a voice in our process. You\u2019ve got even some white folks who feel disaffected by what\u2019s going on in this country who are going to have a say in this process.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a super powerful way to go into this presidential process by having people like that that the Democratic Party has always said, \u2018Ehhh, I don\u2019t know \u2015 (A) we legally can\u2019t talk to them, or (B) I don\u2019t really want to waste our time on them,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cAnd we\u2019re saying no, they\u2019re worth the time.\u201d",

        "subtitle": "House Democrats are beginning a process to mandate the first formal pressure on Saudi Arabia through a must-pass bill. Sen. McConnell will decide if it survives.",
        "author": "Akbar Shahid Ahmed",
        "date": "07/09/2019 05:45 am ET",
        "content": " Congress is about to put historic pressure on Saudi Arabia for the gruesome murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, its devastating military campaign in its desperately poor neighboring country of Yemen and other excesses, such as the alleged torture and sexual assault of detained female activists \u2015 unless Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his lieutenants intervene. It\u2019s a critical test of whether the U.S. can hold foreign partners accountable for repugnant and destabilizing behavior enabled by American security guarantees and a potentially telling moment for a Republican Party that presents its hawkish approach to global affairs as fundamentally moral. Over the next two weeks, the Democrat-controlled House will finalize its version of this year\u2019s defense authorization act, a piece of legislation that\u2019s often called \u201cmust-pass\u201d because it greenlights continued funding for the military. Lawmakers skeptical of the Saudis are focused on three amendments to the bill: a yearlong ban on selling U.S. bombs to Riyadh and its chief partner in the bloody Yemen intervention, the United Arab Emirates; no more money for the two main aspects of U.S. support for that effort, intelligence-sharing and logistical help; and a requirement for the Trump administration to name all people it knows to be involved in the assassination of Khashoggi and place sanctions on them \u2015 a move that would likely target people beyond the 17 Saudi officials already blacklisted for the murder and possibly affect even the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Although many Democrats and a handful of Republicans have spent months criticizing the prince for his reported role in the killing and have spent years highlighting alleged war crimes and the development of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen, Capitol Hill hasn\u2019t yet formally penalized Saudi Arabia. It instead has advanced\u00a0historic but largely symbolic measures to signal disapproval. President Donald Trump used an emergency declaration in May to torpedo the policy with the greatest real-world impact, a hold that Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) placed last year on $2 billion worth of weapons for the Saudis and the UAE. Angry with Trump\u2019s disregard for legally enshrined procedure on arms sales and still eager to show Riyadh that misdeeds have consequences, members of Congress see the process of passing the defense bill as a way to force change. \u201cI\u2019m reasonably confident that we can get it done in the House,\u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), who authored the amendments on arms sales and sanctions. Support from mainstream Democratic leaders is bolstering Malinowski\u2019s suggestions and Rep. Ro Khanna\u2019s (D-Calif.) bill to defund U.S. assistance in Yemen. House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), who\u2019s usually been sympathetic to Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations competing with Iran, supports Malinowki\u2019s amendments, and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who runs the House Intelligence Committee, has blessed Khanna\u2019s plan, which will help weaken the common criticism that cutting off intelligence support for the Yemen campaign threatens important counterterrorism work.\u00a0Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), who as chair of the House Rules Committee plays a big role in deciding what legislation gets considered, has long called for the U.S. to reassess its cozy relationship with the Saudis. There could be tweaks and snafus in the process of getting the amendments attached to the defense bill. One or all could be put up for a vote by the full House to signal strong support, including from Republicans, rather than simply passed in leadership\u2019s package of scores of non-controversial additions.\u00a0Other Saudi-related initiatives currently receiving less attention could attract sudden interest.\u00a0And arguments between progressives and centrists over the total approved defense spending could delay passage of the overall legislation. But the real dispute will come when representatives of the two chambers gather to reconcile their versions of the defense bill and craft a compromise that can make it to Trump\u2019s desk. This is the first time in this presidency that one of these measures has had to make it through a House and Senate controlled by different parties. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), who is a key Republican in the process as chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to do anything related to Yemen,\u201d said Kate Kizer, the policy director at the nonprofit Win Without War. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a battle.\u201d McConnell, Inhofe and other GOP power players on foreign policy, such as Sen. Jim Risch (Idaho), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, largely hew to Trump\u2019s line that the U.S. relationship with the Saudis is too important to be derailed over matters like a high-profile murder in a diplomatic facility. Some influential members of the caucus, notably Sens. Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), are resisting that kind of cynicism, but most Republicans are following McConnell\u2019s cue. Come conference time \u2015 when Inhofe, his counterpart Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Reps. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) and Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) negotiate over the final form of the defense bill \u2015 danger looms for the efforts to mandate a change of course by the Saudis and their allies. \u201cGiven McConnell does MBS\u2019 and this White House\u2019s bidding, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll try to maneuver to keep these provisions out of the final bill [and]... steamroll the House,\u201d a Democratic aide said on condition of anonymity, using a popular acronym for the Saudi prince. \u201cNow with our new majority, we will have key Democratic leaders fighting to keep these provisions in.\u201d Were Republicans to quash serious restrictions out of concern over U.S. national security and relationships in a strategic region \u2015 or just to avoid angering Trump and big donors in the defense industry \u2015 they would be shielding a dictator and encouraging his ilk to commit even more brutal excesses. They might not, of course, see that as a problem. The question for the fate of the monthslong congressional campaign for accountability is whether its proponents in the GOP are as serious about justice as they purport to be in public. So far, Risch has felt pressured enough that he has claimed he will offer his own road map for addressing Saudi behavior, but Young has struggled to advance a bill he and Menendez designed to alter Saudi behavior. McConnell\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. For Democrats, what counts is how much they prioritize the measures during dealmaking as they throw their revitalized strength behind other major concerns, such as\u00a0preventing a war with Iran and challenging Trump\u2019s ban on transgender service members, and whether the party can keep its own disparate ideological factions united while securing the kind of limited GOP support it has had in the past on Saudi-related issues. Engel\u2019s decision to support the weapon transfer ban was a striking turn that suggested a more assertive approach from leadership after he abandoned an effort to present a bill with a high-ranking Republican that would have been more lenient to the Saudis. His choice also reflects the party\u2019s shifting dynamics: as Engel faces two primary challengers who are blasting him as a hawk, the 16-term lawmaker \u201chas a new sense of urgency,\u201d a peace advocate who is tied into congressional circles told HuffPost. Antiwar and human rights activists are closely watching whether Reed, the top Democrat on defense issues, will also indicate more support for their causes by fighting to keep an end to U.S. support for the Saudi-UAE Yemen campaign in the bill. (Last year, Trump responded to public pressure over the conflict by ending the clearest element of U.S. assistance: aerial refueling for the Arab states\u2019 bombing sprees. But just months ago, the president vetoed successful bipartisan legislation to pull U.S. forces out of the war altogether.) Given the furor and discussions among senators of even tougher proposals targeting the Saudis, Republicans could see the Democratic amendments as relatively moderate and something they could support, said Malinowski, who entered Congress just six months ago and who was the main human rights official in President Barack Obama\u2019s State Department. \u201cI think there\u2019s broad consensus among Democrats, including leadership, that we need to do something,\u201d Malinowski said. \u201cAnd significant concern on the Republican side as well.\u201d",

        "content": " Following a contentious debate among Democratic White House contenders Wednesday, a number of party leaders aren\u2019t thrilled that some of the candidates focused on attacking former President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy as a way to challenge Joe Biden. In one of the debate\u2019s\u00a0hottest exchanges, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey called out the former vice president \u2015 the frontrunner in the Democratic nomination race \u2015 for repeatedly using Obama\u2019s name to shield himself from criticism directed his way on issues like criminal justice and immigration. \u201cMr. vice president, you can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Booker said, referring to Biden\u2019s \u2015 and Obama\u2019s \u2015 record on immigration, which saw a record number of undocumented immigrants deported during their eight-year administration. \u201cYou invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can\u2019t do it when it\u2019s convenient and then dodge it when it\u2019s not.\u201d Biden defended himself by noting Obama\u2019s decision to select him as his running mate, saying, \u201cBarack Obama knew exactly who I was.\u201d Also taking Biden to task on the deportation figures was Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2015 a particularly striking moment, since the Texan served in Obama\u2019s administration as secretary of housing and urban development. Biden spotlighted that, responding to Castro,\u00a0\u201cThe secretary, we sat together in many meetings. I never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary. Castro retorted: \u201cIt looks like one of us has learned from the lessons of the past and one of us hasn\u2019t.\u201d Polls show Obama remains a popular figure among all voters, with approval ratings easily outstripping those for President Donald Trump.\u00a0And among Democrats, Obama remains by far the most admired politician. Booker, in comments to CNN\u00a0on Thursday, insisted it wasn\u2019t a negative to reconsider part of the record of the Obama administration as part of the process of choosing the next Democratic presidential nominee. Democrats are \u201chaving an honest conversation about an administration that was incredible,\u201d Booker said.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure (if) Barack Obama was sitting here ... He will tell you, \u2018I made some mistakes.\u2019\u201d But several of Booker\u2019s Democratic Senate colleagues expressed concern about the tactic, arguing it would needlessly expose divisions in the party and take the focus off of Trump and his administration. \u201cI think attacking President Obama is bad policy and bad politics,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Thursday. Of Biden\u2019s tenure as vice president, Blumenthal added: \u201cHe owns it, for better or worse. But he should be proud of it.\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois also suggested the Democratic race should be marked by a more hands-off approach toward Obama. \u201cYou can disagree with him, and I have, but the bottom line is ... he did an extraordinary job, and he should be given that recognition by those that are running for the presidency.\u201d Others who watched the debate expressed similar sentiments, including longtime Washington-based political analyst Stuart Rothenberg: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York urged his party\u2019s White House contenders to train their sights firmly on Trump. \u201cI think President Obama is a very popular figure in America to this day because he did a very good job. Did he accomplish everything? No,\u201d Schumer told reporters on Thursday, \u201cYou compare the Obama administration to this administration \u2015 it\u2019s night and day.\u201d Veteran Republican political consultant John Weaver \u2015 a fierce Trump critic \u2015was blunter:",

        "content": " SAN DIEGO \u2015 A new poll confirms that a tight three-way race is developing in California\u2019s key Democratic presidential primary, with one candidate showing impressive momentum: Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. A\u00a0survey released Thursday by the Public Policy Institute of California showed\u00a0Warren the choice of 23% of likely primary voters, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 22% and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at 21%. When the Democratic race was first taking shape in the spring, a Quinnipiac Poll had shown Warren in single digits in the Golden State, far behind Biden, Sanders and California Sen. Kamala Harris. Indeed, as Warren\u2019s support has surged in California \u2015 as it has nationally \u2015 the prospects for Harris in her home state have taken a hit, again reflecting national trends. Perhaps the new poll\u2019s most striking finding is that Harris trailed well behind the pack with just 8% support, another sign of trouble for her struggling campaign. \u201cWarren may well be a beneficiary of Harris\u2019 collapse,\u201d said veteran California Democratic strategist Garry South. \u201cSince her very impressive debut (as a White House candidate) in Oakland in January, Harris has done little in California to solidify whatever support may have been potentially there for her.\u201d Voters like Cindy Henderson, an author who showed up to hear Warren speak Thursday as the candidate made her first campaign stop in San Diego, give a glimpse into the race\u2019s current dynamics. \u201cI was actually a Kamala fan,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cJust something in the last two or three months, I\u2019m just kind of dropping off [on her]. I think she\u2019s not quite ready. I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s much depth yet. The more I hear and watch what Elizabeth does, it\u2019s just like, OK, she\u2019s a rock star. I\u2019m loving her message.\u201d Warren drew about 8,500 people for her rally in downtown San Diego. (A rally for Sanders was attended by an estimated 6,400 people at the same venue in May). Like most of Warren\u2019s audiences, her Thursday crowd was predominantly white \u2015 which aligns with how her support breaks down in public opinion surveys, as well. A UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll\u00a0released in late September showed her leading the California race with 29%, with Biden at 21% and Sanders at 20%. But Warren trailed both of those two with Latino voters. Warren mostly stuck to her populist stump speech on Thursday, laying out her plans to take on Washington corruption, special interests and big corporations. She appeared to choke up at one point as she recalled the family struggles that marked her childhood in Oklahoma, including the time her mother lost her job. The story is a big hit with many voters, who cite it when discussing the candidate. At one point, after discussing her plan to break up big tech companies, Warren called out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who told employees in recently leaked audio the company would \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to defeat her efforts. \u201cAnd yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I\u2019m looking at you,\u201d she said, to cheers and applause from the audience. The true contours of the Democratic battle will emerge in February when the narrative-driving nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina take place. But right around the corner comes primaries in 14 states on March 3, Super Tuesday. And California is the day\u2019s dominant contest, with 416 convention delegates allotted. That\u2019s why so many of the main Democratic contenders are paying frequent visits to the state to meet with voters \u2015 as well as well-heeled donors. Also, early mail-in voting begins a month before the actual primary date. And conquering California presents unique challenges for a politician: its\u00a0population is decidedly more diverse than that in the earlier-voting states, campaign ads are far more expensive than in those other locales and gaining media attention is difficult. In terms of having the money to compete, Warren and Sanders are well-primed as the race enters the final stretch before primary season. Warren raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, her campaign told supporters in an email Friday, and has $25.7 million cash on hand. Sanders, hospitalized earlier this week in Nevada because of a blocked artery, raised $25.3 million from July to September (his campaign didn\u2019t release a cash-on-hand figure). Their figures are especially impressive because both candidates have opted against holding fundraisers focused on big-dollar donors during the primary campaign. Biden\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, reported a lackluster $15.2 million raised over the past three months, far less than his second-quarter haul of $21.5 million. He could be in trouble if his fundraising continues to taper off. President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee announced raising a combined $125 million in the third quarter, a record-setting haul. His war chest will only grow as Democrats spend several months \u2015 and maybe more, in the case of a lengthy primary battle \u2015 determining their nominee. Warren dismissed Trump\u2019s haul on Thursday, telling reporters she didn\u2019t think \u201cscooping up a bunch of money from rich people and buying a bunch of TV ads\u201d is \u201chow democracy works anymore.\u201d She added: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be about going out and building a grassroots movement.\u201d Given Warren\u2019s steady rise in the primary race, the Oct. 15 Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, looms particularly large for her. As the frontrunner in several of the race\u2019s most recent national polls, she\u2019ll likely have a bigger target on her back. Even as Warren received enthusiastic backing at her San Diego rally, interviews with some of the undecided voters at it underscored some of the doubts she still most overcome. Corinne Lytle-Bonine, an environmental consultant who voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary, acknowledged she was giving Warren a strong look this time around. \u201cHaving the nomination be another old white man is a hard pill to swallow when it feels like women have been the ones really carrying the Democrats through 2018,\u201d Lytle-Bonine said. She added that \u201cI think Warren has some establishment credentials that Bernie doesn\u2019t, and may make her more electable in the general election.\u201d Still, Lytle-Bonine questioned why Warren has been hesitant to acknowledge whether the middle class would see a tax hike if, as president, she would push into law \u201cMedicare-for-All\u201d government health care plan Sanders has introduced and that she supports. Several of Warren\u2019s rivals have criticized her for repeatedly dodging the question; she\u2019s brushed off the attacks as unfair Republican framing. \u201cI wish that she would\u201d directly deal with that issue, Lytle-Bonine said. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t know what is holding her back. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hard answer to say \u2018Yes, we\u2019ll raise taxes, however, all of your out-of-pocket expenses (for health care) go away.\u2019\u201d",

        "content": " Sarah Palin won\u2019t say whether she experienced or witnessed sexual harassment at Fox News, but she does have a message for the victims: If you don\u2019t speak out when it happens, don\u2019t complain about it later. During an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead,\u201d Palin hinted that she wasn\u2019t happy during her time as a Fox News contributor but would not divulge details \u2015 even when asked about Fox News\u2019 corporate culture in the age of Bill O\u2019Reilly. \u201cI think the key there is that I used to be with Fox. The corporate culture there obviously has to change,\u201d the former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate said. \u201cWomen don\u2019t deserve, they shouldn\u2019t have to put up with any intimidating workspace.\u201d Then Palin turned her focus on the women who made accusations of sexual harassment, telling them that it\u2019s their responsibility to quit their jobs and change the workplace culture. \u201cIf a woman believes that she is being intimidating and harassed, she needs to stand up and do something about it and not stick around for a paycheck for years and years and years, and then after the fact complain about what she went through,\u201d Palin told Tapper. \u201cAs a strong woman,\u201d she added, \u201cI say we should feel more empowered than that and take a stand and get out of the place and blow the whistle on the perpetrator doing the bad stuff so that the culture will change.\u201d Palin is right: More women should speak out against workplace harassment. But women don\u2019t stay silent about harassment because they\u2019re not strong women. As the past has shown,\u00a0reporting abuse isn\u2019t as easy as telling on your boss so that the problem will go away. Women don\u2019t report sexual harassment for a number of reasons, including shame, fear of retribution, fear of losing their source of income and fear of not being believed.\u00a0In fact, a 2015 survey found that 71 percent of women\u00a0ages 18 to 34 did not report workplace sexual harassment. And when they do report it, victims sometimes end up with more problems, as in the case of Susan Fowler, the former Uber engineer who detailed the chaos surrounding her sexual harassment complaint to Uber\u2019s human resources department in a February blog post. Perhaps Palin should take some notes from professor Anita Hill, the pioneer in the fight against workplace harassment who famously testified against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991\u00a0to much scrutiny and insult. \u201cThe problem with sexual harassment isn\u2019t just because people behave badly,\u201d Hill said in a recent interview with USA Today. \u201cThe problem is our inability to develop productive responses to it, and that exists because of our culture that accepts it, because that culture then gets built into how we approach solutions to it.\u201d Hill added: \u201cIt gets built into the choices we make about who can be believed. And even when we find sexual harassment exists, the solutions are very often to move the women who have complained to other positions.\u201d",

If they don\u2019t want to look into it, they don\u2019t have to.\u201d He added: \u201cFrankly, as far as I\u2019m concerned, if China wants to look into something, I think that\u2019s great.

He made the comments amid impeachment proceedings prompted by his July 25 phone call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he requested that foreign government\u2019s aid in digging up dirt on Biden. Multiple Republican lawmakers, when asked if they believed Trump\u2019s China comments were appropriate,\u00a0defended them as being a joke, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rep.

Pete Buttigieg has surged, while Mr. Biden\u2019s travails have put the race in flux.By Alexander BurnsPRINT EDITIONNew Poll Says Warren Holds Lead in Iowa|November 2, 2019, Page A1",
        "author": "Alexander Burns",
        "date": "null",
        "content": " The top Democratic presidential candidates are locked in a close race in the 2020 Iowa caucuses, with Senator Elizabeth Warren slightly ahead of Senator Bernie Sanders, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers. Ms. Warren appears to have solidified her gains in the first voting state while Mr. Buttigieg has climbed quickly to catch up with Mr. Sanders and overtake Mr. Biden, the onetime front-runner. Ms. Warren is drawing support from 22 percent of likely caucusgoers, while Mr. Sanders is at 19 percent, followed by Mr. Buttigieg at 18 percent and Mr. Biden at 17 percent. The survey is full of alarming signs for Mr. Biden, who entered the race in April at the top of the polls in Iowa and nationally. He is still in the lead in most national polls, but his comparatively weak position in the earliest primary and caucus states now presents a serious threat to his candidacy. With the Iowa caucuses just three months away, Mr. Biden\u2019s unsteadiness appears to have opened a path in the race for other Democrats closer to the political middle, particularly Mr. Buttigieg. The poll reveals a race in flux but not in disarray, framed by a stark debate about the direction of the Democratic Party and by a degree of fluidity arising from Mr. Biden\u2019s travails. In the early states, at least, the former vice president appears to be buckling on one side to the expansive populism of Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, and on the other to Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s calls for generational change. While no single candidate has a decisive advantage, the strongest currents in the party appear to be swirling around candidates promising in different ways to challenge the existing political and economic order. Several of them would also represent change by virtue of their identities, including Ms. Warren, who would be the first female president, and Mr. Buttigieg, who is gay. But despite the historic diversity of the field, all the top candidates are white. In Iowa, a state that helped vault Barack Obama into the presidency, the poll found a substantial bloc concerned that anyone other than a heterosexual white man might struggle to defeat President Trump. The survey found Iowa Democrats in a divided and perhaps indecisive state about what the party must do in order to deny Mr. Trump a second term. They are an ideologically mixed group, with younger voters trending to the left and leaning strongly toward Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden remains the favorite candidate of older voters, but only 2 percent of respondents under 45 years old said they currently plan to caucus for him. The caucuses are Feb. 3. In the poll, large majorities were supportive of ambitious liberal policy goals, like breaking up big banks, increasing Social Security benefits and implementing single-payer health care. But perhaps out of political caution, the poll also found that more Democrats would prefer to nominate someone who supports improving the private health insurance system rather than replacing it altogether. And most Democrats said they would favor a nominee willing to work with Republicans. There is still plenty of room for shifts in political momentum: Two-thirds of likely caucusgoers in The Times poll said they could still be persuaded to change their minds. Outside the top tier of four candidates, the best-performing Democrat was Senator Amy Klobuchar, supported by 4 percent of respondents, followed by Senator Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang, both at 3 percent, and Senator Cory Booker, Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer, all at 2 percent. The Iowa caucuses are a fairly arcane institution that differs from a standard primary election. They traditionally require Democrats to gather at myriad locations around the state for a multiround process in which voters group themselves behind their first-choice candidate; if a candidate registers less than 15 percent support, their supporters can reallocate themselves to other candidates. Factoring in voters\u2019 second choices, Ms. Warren had the broadest appeal: She is the first or second preference of 47 percent of Iowa Democrats, with two-thirds of Sanders supporters naming her as their backup choice. Mr. Sanders is the first or second choice of 34 percent of likely caucusgoers, followed by Mr. Buttigieg at 31 percent. Mr. Biden was in fourth place by this measure, at 28 percent; only 1 in 10 voters named him as their second choice. The Times/Siena survey of 439 Iowa Democratic caucusgoers was conducted from Oct. 25-30 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points. Here are the full results and the methodology for the poll. One issue that occasions little division among Democrats is impeachment. Eighty-nine percent of people in the poll said they support impeaching Mr. Trump and removing him from office. Most Iowa Democrats in the poll said they were somewhat or very confident that the party\u2019s top candidates would beat Mr. Trump in the general election. There was no difference in how they assessed Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren on that measure, and Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg fared only slightly worse. The confidence Iowa Democrats expressed in Ms. Warren as a general-election candidate could represent something of a turning point for her candidacy, if she can extend the sentiment to other early states. For much of the race, even Democratic voters who have embraced her ideas and political persona have harbored reservations about her odds against Mr. Trump. In Iowa, that appears to have changed. Jonathan Morrison, 45, of Mason City, said he was drawn to Ms. Warren because of her grasp of economic issues and believed she would \u201chold her own\u201d against the president. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to allow herself to be pushed around or bullied by Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to stick to the facts and call him out on his policies.\u201d Mr. Morrison, who said he is a drone pilot in the oil and gas industry, said he also liked Mr. Buttigieg, whom he described as having a \u201cleadership aura about him.\u201d \u201cI think Pete Buttigieg is going to be president someday,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s this time around.\u201d Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders appear to be tapping into a thirst among many primary voters for transformational policies rather than incremental improvements in governance. But the presence of two forceful, well-funded populists in the race may be preventing either Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren from gaining a wide advantage. They have assembled somewhat different political coalitions: Ms. Warren is the top choice of younger voters, women and people with college degrees, while Mr. Sanders fares better with men and people with high school degrees or less. He also retains significant backing from young people, and his supporters are the least likely to say they might change their minds before February. Though Mr. Buttigieg would be the youngest president ever, he is not exceptionally popular with his generational cohort. He fared somewhat better with older voters than younger ones; like Ms. Warren, he registered strongly among people with college and postgraduate degrees. Mr. Biden\u2019s support comes almost exclusively from older voters: Among people 65 years or older, he is still the front-runner, with backing from nearly a third of them. But he has negligible support among younger Iowans. With voters under 45, Mr. Biden is polling several points behind Mr. Yang, a former tech executive who has never run for office before. An ideological gulf, running along generational lines, is a major feature of the Democratic race. Two-thirds of voters under 30 favored either Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders, while a smaller majority of people over 65 favored either Mr. Biden or Mr. Buttigieg. An overwhelming 85 percent of voters under 30 said they preferred a nominee promising fundamental change over one seeking to restore normalcy in Washington. Among voters more than 65 years old, 7 in 10 preferred a candidate who would bring back normalcy. William Nix of Waterloo, Iowa, is among the young voters torn between several candidates promising large-scale change. He said he had long admired Mr. Sanders but worried that he might pull out of the race after his recent heart attack. Mr. Nix, who is 21 and works on an assembly line at John Deere, said he was considering Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, and wanted a nominee focused on economic inequality and access to education. \u201cI\u2019m really all for making going to college more affordable,\u201d Mr. Nix said. \u201cThat is my biggest thing, because I want to go to college myself.\u201d Most Iowa Democrats appear to believe it is easier for candidates who are heterosexual, white, male and ideologically moderate to win presidential races, though that assessment is not playing a decisive role in shaping their caucus preferences. Most poll respondents said they believed it would be harder to win the election with a nominee who is more liberal than most Democrats, or one who is gay. About half expressed those reservations about a female nominee, and 4 in 10 were pessimistic about an African-American candidate These reservations about embracing the diversity of their presidential field have not translated into enthusiasm for Mr. Biden. One reason may be his age: A majority of respondents said they believed it would be harder to win the election with a candidate over the age of 75. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders would turn 80 within a year or two of taking office. Julia Roberts, a voter in Winterset, Iowa, is among those wary of nominating someone whose identity could unsettle rural conservatives. Ms. Roberts, 60, a retired state employee, favored Mr. Biden because she saw him as the strongest general-election candidate and valued his foreign policy experience. \u201cI think, really, he\u2019s got the best chance of beating Trump,\u201d Ms. Roberts said, adding that she also liked Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg but feared there would be \u201cprejudice in play\u201d against them.  Tonda Hadden, 63, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, said she had originally favored Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders. But she worried Mr. Sanders was \u201ctoo old and too left.\u201d With Mr. Biden, she had grown \u201ca little worried about his gaffes.\u201d Ms. Hadden said she was now \u201cstill looking\u201d over her options: She named Ms. Warren as her current favorite and Mr. Buttigieg as an intriguing alternative. And she said she hoped some others, like Mr. Booker, whom she saw interviewed Wednesday on \u201cThe View,\u201d would get a closer look from voters. \u201cI really like him,\u201d she said of Mr. Booker, \u201cand I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s not up in the polls.\u201d",

        "content": " Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she hoped for a return to \u201cboring, normal times\u201d after the 2020 election, voicing skepticism of her party\u2019s populist wing and predicting that Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposal for single-payer health care would never get enacted. At The New York Times DealBook conference in New York, Mrs. Clinton said she saw two of the biggest policies embraced by the left in the 2020 Democratic primary \u2014 \u201cMedicare for all\u201d-style health care and a tax on the assets of the very wealthy \u2014 as unworkable or politically impractical. She said Democrats should pursue the goal of universal health coverage, but through other means. A longtime leader of her party\u2019s moderate wing, Mrs. Clinton was most blunt about Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal to replace private health insurance with a single-payer system funded largely by taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Asked if she thought that proposal could get passed into law, Mrs. Clinton answered in the negative. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the goal is the right goal.\u201d Mrs. Clinton did not criticize either Ms. Warren or Senator Bernie Sanders, the liberal populist who challenged Mrs. Clinton in the 2016 primary and who also supports Medicare for all, in harsh or personal terms. But she suggested that the approach to health care favored by both was misguided, saying that \u201cthe smarter approach is to build on what we have\u201d by adding the option of a public health care plan to the offerings of the Affordable Care Act. It is not a surprising preference for Mrs. Clinton: In the 2016 campaign, she supported introducing a public health insurance option but consistently rejected Mr. Sanders\u2019s calls for single-payer health care. Speaking on Thursday at North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro, N.C., Ms. Warren was asked about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks. \u201cI\u2019m saying, you don\u2019t get what you don\u2019t fight for,\u201d she said in response. \u201cYou know, you got to be willing to get out there and fight.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comments suggest she remains skeptical of the populist forces on the rise in Democratic politics. While she did not endorse a candidate, she indicated a clear preference in one of the largest debates raging in the Democratic Party: whether to nominate a candidate who would make sweeping changes to the country\u2019s government and economy, or someone who would restore something like normalcy in Washington. \u201cI would like us to return to a presidency where we don\u2019t have to wake up every day worried,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, adding, \u201cI\u2019d like us to get back to sort of boring, normal times.\u201d She also said she believed she knew who the Democratic nominee was \u201clikely to be,\u201d but declined to name that person. Mrs. Clinton, who has not entirely ruled out another run for the presidency but has taken no apparent steps toward a campaign, also sounded a note of skepticism about the detail-rich policy debates that have helped shape the Democratic primary so far. Those disputes during primary season, she said, do not always translate into actual governance after the election. Her 2008 primary battle with Barack Obama furnished an instructive case study, Mrs. Clinton said: During that campaign, Mr. Obama fiercely opposed her proposal for a government mandate that all individuals purchase health insurance, but he went on to include that very rule as president. The clash over health care unfolding in the primary now, she said, represented \u201ca very healthy debate.\u201d Of a tax on wealth, which is favored by both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton questioned whether it could really function as its proponents intend. She said she would support other methods of taxing the rich, like raising income-tax rates, imposing stiffer estate taxes and eliminating certain provisions of the tax code that favor the financial sector. \u201cI think there are other ways to raise the revenues, and ways that do get those who are well-off to pay more, because I do think we\u2019ve got to have that as part of our effort to combat inequality,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. In theory, Mrs. Clinton herself could be subject to the wealth taxes proposed by Ms. Warren, who has called for a levy on fortunes over $50 million, and Mr. Sanders, who would impose a similar tax on fortunes greater than $32 million. Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have earned well over $100 million through paid speaking and book deals since the turn of the century.",

        "subtitle": "How Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Is Bringing Her Instagram Followers Into the Political ProcessThe incoming congresswoman has given her followers the type of behind-the-scenes look at congressional orientation that\u2019s not usually broadcast.By Talya MinsbergPRINT EDITIONNovember 17, 2018",
        "author": "Talya Minsberg",
        "date": "Nov. 16, 2018",
        "content": " Last Friday, three days after being elected to the House of Representatives, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez invited over 600,000 people to chat as she made loaded macaroni and cheese in an Instant Pot. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, was streaming on Instagram Live, answering questions submitted through the live chat feature as she grated cheese and sang along to Janelle Mon\u00e1e. It wasn\u2019t too surprising to see her there, as her followers have watched each step of her journey since she announced she would be seeking a congressional seat in April 2017. Over the past week, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has taken these followers behind the scenes of congressional orientation, as she\u2019s visited monuments, met with other incoming freshmen and looked through the new member directory \u2014 which she joked was like a yearbook. \u201cAt orientation you get a swag bag,\u201d she said in one story, displaying a shopping bag that she explained held her new secure devices. In another, she walked between government buildings, whispering, \u201cGuys, there are secret underground tunnels,\u201d adding in a caption, \u201cJk they\u2019re not secret but it\u2019s cool.\u201d Government officials have always found creative ways to reach their constituents, from President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s fireside chats to President Trump\u2019s use of Twitter. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who at 29 is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, is especially good at connecting with her followers on Instagram, which can be a more intimate platform \u2014 especially when a user speaks directly to the camera. The video quality isn\u2019t great, the audio can get muffled and the lighting can be overexposed. But that\u2019s partly the point. Using her cellphone\u2019s forward-facing camera, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez provides civics lessons and discusses her personal highs and lows. The videos seem designed to be accessible to everyone. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has started using a closed-captioning tool called Clipomatic so that those who are deaf or hard of hearing can follow along. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is also an active user of Twitter, the preferred clap-back platform. On Thursday, a reporter from the Washington Examiner tweeted a picture of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s back with the caption, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something: that jacket and coat don\u2019t look like a girl who struggles.\u201d It was one of several recent attempts by conservative media to portray her as wealthier than she says she is. He later deleted the tweet, but not before Ms. Ocasio-Cortez responded. She replied to her initial tweet with another, tagging the reporter, Eddie Scarry, and including a screenshot of his original tweet. \u201cOh, does @eScarry think he can delete his misogyny without an apology? I don\u2019t think so. You\u2019re a journalist \u2014 readers should know your bias.\u201d And she has company among her fellow incoming freshmen. After Representative-elect Ilhan Omar of Minnesota arrived in Washington this week, she tweeted, \u201cWe did not come to play,\u201d along with a link to a story in The Cut. The headline: \u201cYour Cool New Congresswomen Are Already Hanging Out.\u201d A week earlier, Ms. Omar reacted to Representative-elect Ayanna Pressley\u2019s win in Massachusetts with a Beyonc\u00e9 GIF. Like Snapchat stories, Instagram stories are ephemeral and automatically delete after 24 hours. But users can save stories and pin them to their pages as a \u201chighlight,\u201d allowing followers to watch a story weeks after it was published. Three months ago, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made an Instagram story in which she spoke about how she was feeling. That story, labeled \u201cPep Talk,\u201d is pinned to the top of her page as a highlight. At one point, she sighed deeply and said, \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be perfect all the time on every issue.\u201d \u201cI think what people forget is if we want everyday, working-class Americans to run for office, and not like these robots, that we have to acknowledge and accept imperfection and growth and humanity in our government,\u201d she added. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez did not respond to requests for an interview. Some have dismissed her Instagram use as merely an example of a young person knowing how to use a platform. But it\u2019s not that simple, said Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who studies social media. \u201cVery few people can get away with wearing those animated Instagram glasses but also be taken seriously,\u201d Professor Grygiel said. \u201cShe can command both spaces.\u201d In 2018, social media skills are expected of political figures and their teams. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is a top Instagram user among Republican politicians, with a following of nearly 280,000. But his Instagram presence is distant, filled with professional photography and text cards that do not lend themselves to a sense of authenticity. According to an analysis in The New York Times, the number of interactions on Democrats\u2019 Instagram accounts dwarfed those on Republican accounts within a 30-day period ending Oct. 15. The political tilt of Instagram reflects the demographics of the platform\u2019s users. Instagram users skew younger, as do Democratic voters. One of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s biggest strengths on Instagram is that she tries to bring her followers into the political process and convince them that they, too, could someday be in her shoes. \u201cWhat she\u2019s saying is, \u2018Hey, develop these skills alongside of me and we will be a community, we\u2019ll be a force,\u2019\u201d Professor Grygiel said. \u201cShe\u2019s not just saying, \u2018Hey, support me, support me, support me.\u2019\u201d",

GreenPRINT EDITIONBlack Colleges Support Rollback of Crackdown on For-Profit Education|January 13, 2018, Page A11",
        "author": "Erica L. Green",
        "date": "Jan. 12, 2018",
        "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When Education Secretary Betsy DeVos began rolling back regulations to curb the predatory practices of for-profit colleges, critics seethed that the Trump administration was throwing yet another lifeline to a rapacious industry \u2014 in this case, one that sees vulnerable undergraduates as nothing more than moneymaking targets. Henry N. Tisdale, the president of the small campus of Claflin University in Orangeburg, S.C., disagrees. Since the Obama administration announced that it would establish a smoother pathway for students to claim that they had been misled by their colleges, Mr. Tisdale said he has feared an expensive legal battle over the smallest leaflet advertising a service on campus. \u201cA small mistake or error at a college like Claflin could put us out of business,\u201d Mr. Tisdale said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources ready to respond to frivolous claims. Mr. Tisdale and his counterparts at other small, historically black colleges and universities are among an unlikely cohort of supporters for Ms. DeVos\u2019s effort to tighten a wide-ranging regulation that offers federal debt relief to students who were defrauded or deceived by their higher-education institutions. While the rules targeted for-profit colleges with billion-dollar budgets, they apply to all institutions \u2014 including small, nonprofit colleges like Claflin that have been educating low-income, minority and first-generation students for more than a century without scandal. \u201cIt\u2019s a regulation that should be focused on the bad actors, and we have been lumped in when we\u2019re serving the students the bad actors are preying on,\u201d Mr. Tisdale said. \u201cWe believe it should be improved to prevent unintended consequences.\u201d Ms. DeVos\u2019s plans to overhaul the Obama-era rules for student borrowers reached a crucial stage this week, as a committee convened to renegotiate the regulations began debating the burden of proof students would have to meet to win claims against institutions. The Education Department has proposed that students establish \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that institutions misled them, compared with a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard applied under the Obama administration. Students would also have to prove that institutions had an \u201cintent to deceive,\u201d \u201cknowledge of falsity\u201d and \u201creckless disregard\u201d that resulted in financial harm to borrowers. Officials in the department said during negotiations this week that they believed the current preponderance-of-evidence standard did not sufficiently protect taxpayers and institutions. But Joseline Garcia, a negotiator on the panel and the president of the United States Student Association, said she believed the new standard swung too far in the opposite direction. \u201cI think that switching to \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 does the opposite for students,\u201d Ms. Garcia said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t protect them at all.\u201d She added: \u201cAlthough the institution may have made an honest mistake, the harm is still the same for the student. And people\u2019s lives are greatly impacted by that harm.\u201d Ms. DeVos has cast the Obama-era regulations as taxpayer-funded money grabs. In announcing the repeal of the rules, she said that institutions of all types raised concerns about \u201cexcessively broad definitions of substantial misrepresentation and breach of contract, the lack of meaningful due process protections for institutions and \u2018financial triggers\u2019 under the new rules.\u201d The United Negro College Fund, which has joined the chorus of criticism over the Trump administration\u2019s lack of tangible commitment to historically black colleges and universities, has long been among the most vocal opponents of the Obama-era rules. Since the rules were announced in 2015, the college fund has expressed concern that they could threaten the viability of its 37 member institutions, which include Claflin, Spelman College, Morehouse College and Shaw University. The member institutions collectively educate 60,000 students on campuses of about 2,000 or fewer, and 75 percent of their students receive federal Pell grants. The fund has said that the rules have a disproportionately negative effect on their member institutions because they have historically been underfinanced and serve vulnerable populations. They fear having to spend thousands of dollars fighting claims instead of backing academic programming at institutions that have been graduating students who consistently post high success and satisfaction rates. Representatives at the United Negro College Fund are among the panelists hashing out the new standards and are in a unique position of having to represent both students and institutions. \u201cWe want to make sure this is a balanced process,\u201d said Lodriguez V. Murray, one of the college fund\u2019s members on the federal negotiating team. \u201cWe\u2019re protecting students and the institutions that are giving them a chance to fall into the middle class.\u201d Consumer rights and student advocates say the new standards essentially ask students who probably cannot afford to hire lawyers to become them. \u201cThe administration is effectively asking borrowers to have conducted a full investigation, with the power of discovery, that turns up some very severe findings from their institution before filing a borrower-defense claim,\u201d said Clare McCann, the deputy director for federal higher education policy at the New America Foundation. Education Department officials on the rule-making committee said they could not outline how a student would meet the new burden of proof. But they said they believed, based on the claims that they have reviewed, that students could meet the standards if they were informed about them. But others on the committee expressed concerns that the department had another goal. \u201cThis would effectively do away with borrowers\u2019 ability to get relief in almost all circumstances,\u201d said Abby Shafroth, a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center. The department has struggled to complete a backlog of borrower-defense claims, the bulk of which were overwhelmingly against for-profit colleges, that began pouring in under the Obama administration and swelled to more than 100,000 in the last year. The department attributed the backlog, in part, to an insufficient system established under the Obama administration, which relieved students of $450 million in loan debt after the collapse of Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute. Ms. DeVos announced last month that her department would begin notifying more than 20,000 students whether their claims had been approved. Some would see only partial relief under the new system. Lawyers who represent institutions on the negotiating team said that due process standards were crucial to their constituents because colleges could be held liable for some of the student debt \u201cWe all have bad actors. But in trying to get to the bad guys, are you allocating too much risk on the good guys?\u201d asked Aaron Lacey, a lawyer at Thompson Coburn L.L.P., which represents schools in regulatory litigation. In addition to establishing a new burden of proof for student borrowers who feel defrauded, the department is relaxing financial accountability rules for institutions. Those so-called triggers would have required colleges to take a series of steps to demonstrate their financial health. One such trigger that the United Negro College Fund opposed would have penalized schools if they had a high number of students defaulting on their loans. (Statistics show that the populations that black colleges serve tend to have higher default rates.) That trigger was stricken from the new proposed standards, while others that applied solely to for-profits remained but were made discretionary rather than required.",

        "date": "Feb. 6, 2016",
        "content": " Marlow W. Cook, a moderate one-term Republican senator from Kentucky who gave Mitch McConnell his start in Washington politics but later criticized him for moving sharply to the right, died on Thursday at his home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 89. The cause was complications of a heart attack, his daughter Caroline Ely said. In the 1960s, Mr. Cook led a Republican resurgence in Jefferson County, which includes Louisville, ending a generation of Democratic dominance in a state where registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans two to one. He served two terms as an enormously popular county judge \u2014 an executive position analogous to mayor \u2014 before winning election as senator in 1968, succeeding Thruston B. Morton, also a moderate Republican, who had decided not to seek re-election. Mr. Cook enlisted Mr. McConnell to attract younger voters. A former state president of the Young Ripon Society, a moderate Republican organization, Mr. McConnell was just a year out of law school at the University of Kentucky. \u201cMarlow Cook gave me my first real opportunity in politics, as state youth chairman for his successful Senate campaign,\u201d Mr. McConnell, now the Senate majority leader, said on the floor of the Senate on Thursday. \u201cHe gave me an important opportunity in government too, as chief legislative assistant \u2014 basically what we now call legislative director \u2014 in his Senate office. I worked there for two years. I recall that time fondly. I remain very grateful for it.\u201d In that job, Mr. McConnell played a major role in Senator Cook\u2019s campaign for the Equal Rights Amendment, which passed both houses of Congress but was not ratified by the states. Another aide to Senator Cook was John Yarmuth, now a Democratic congressman from Kentucky. Mr. Cook later expressed surprise and dismay at Mr. McConnell\u2019s shift to the right. \u201cI am absolutely amazed he became a conservative,\u201d he told the magazine Mother Jones in 2014. He added, \u201cI don\u2019t mind someone being a conservative. But to stand up and say, \u2018I\u2019m the most conservative leader of the Senate ever\u2019? Mitch did that, and I thought, \u2018My God.\u2019\u201d Mr. Cook was particularly critical of Senator McConnell\u2019s opposition to the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. \u201cIf he had any knowledge of the lack of health and medical facilities in the hills of Kentucky, he\u2019d know it\u2019s a problem we need to solve,\u201d he told Mother Jones. \u201cFor Mitch McConnell to decide the new health program is not good for Kentucky, it tells me he\u2019s not looking out for his own constituency.\u201d In Washington, Senator Cook earned a reputation as a liberal-leaning moderate with a natural charm that made him one of the most-liked members of the Senate. He could be unpredictable. At the request of President Richard M. Nixon, he served as floor manager of the ultimately unsuccessful effort to confirm Clement F. Haynsworth Jr. to the Supreme Court, and then he cast one of the decisive votes against the president\u2019s next candidate, G. Harrold Carswell. In retirement, Mr. Cook raised eyebrows when, in 2004, he endorsed a Democrat, Senator John Kerry, for president, citing a long list of disagreements with President George W. Bush, chiefly his decision to invade Iraq. \u201cI have been, and will continue to be, a Republican,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed article for The Louisville Courier-Journal. \u201cBut when we as a party send the wrong person to the White House, then it is our responsibility to send him home if our nation suffers as a result of his actions.\u201d Marlow Webster Cook was born on July 27, 1926, in Akron, in western New York State, where his father was an officer for the Louisville Cement Company. The family moved to Louisville when he was a teenager. After graduating from high school in 1944 he immediately enlisted in the Navy. He served on submarines in the European and Pacific theaters. He later enrolled in the University of Louisville, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1948 and a law degree in 1950. He became involved in politics while practicing law, serving two terms as a state representative before winning election to county judge in 1961. One initiative was the purchase, for $34,000, of a broken-down paddle-wheeler, which was renovated and renamed the Belle of Louisville and became a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of the city. When opponents accused him of squandering the taxpayers\u2019 money on the boat, he calculated that the purchase had cost each citizen of the county 6 cents. He kept a jar of pennies on his desk to repay that sum to anyone who called or wrote to complain. In 1967, he ran in the Republican primary for governor, losing narrowly to Louie B. Nunn, who made an issue of Mr. Cook\u2019s religion \u2014 he was a Roman Catholic \u2014 and his liberal policies on desegregation. In his successful run for the Senate the next year, Mr. Cook, in an effort to appeal to supporters of the presidential candidate George C. Wallace, took a hawkish position on the Vietnam War and a tough line on law and order. In defeating the Democratic candidate, Katherine Peden, a former state commerce commissioner, Senator Cook became the first Roman Catholic in Kentucky to hold a major statewide post. He was defeated in 1974, in the aftermath of the Watergate scandals, by the state\u2019s governor, Wendell H. Ford. After practicing law in Washington, Mr. Cook moved to Florida in 1989. In addition to his daughter Caroline, he is survived by his wife, the former Nancy Remmers; three other daughters, Christy Cook, Nancy Spade and Louise Reed; a son, Webster; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.",

        "date": "March 13, 2014",
        "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 It has been a dreadful winter for Democrats as red state incumbents struggle to overcome President Obama\u2019s sagging popularity. But there\u2019s one person in particular Democrats still hope to beat: Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader. Polls say Mr. McConnell is locked in a dead heat for re-election in Kentucky. Some surveys even show him trailing Alison Lundergan Grimes, his Democratic challenger. But the polls overstate his vulnerability. A McConnell defeat would be all but unprecedented. Mr. McConnell is not only an incumbent senator who represents the party opposed to the White House in a midterm election, but he also comes from a state that opposes the president. Since 1956, only seven senators in these circumstances have lost re-election. The last time was in 1998, when John Edwards defeated Senator Lauch Faircloth in North Carolina. But 2014 is not 1998. Back then, President Bill Clinton\u2019s approval rating was in the mid-60s. Today, President Obama\u2019s ratings are mired in the low 40s. Kentucky is also not North Carolina, which only narrowly voted against Mr. Clinton. Kentucky is an extremely favorable state for a Republican candidate: It voted for Romney and McCain by an average of 25 points to the right of the country. From that perspective, there is no precedent for a McConnell defeat. No senator has lost in a state as favorable as Kentucky when the president represents the other party. And it\u2019s not even close: North Carolina, it turns out, is the closest example. States with serious reservations about the incumbent president seem unwilling to dismiss the president\u2019s opponents in the Senate. Very few incumbent senators lose re-election in states as favorable as Kentucky, period. Since 1956, only one incumbent senator has lost re-election in a state more favorable than Kentucky under any circumstance. That senator was Ted Stevens, who was convicted on seven counts of corruption just one week before the 2008 election, in a tough year for Republicans. Despite all of that, he lost by only one percentage point. He is the exception that seems to prove the rule. Mr. McConnell, of course, is not a convicted felon. And unlike Mr. Stevens, Mr. McConnell comfortably won re-election in worst-case circumstances in 2008, just one month after shepherding TARP, the bank bailout package, to passage in the Senate. Since then, Mr. Obama has alienated eastern Kentucky\u2019s coal country, traditionally the most Democratic-leaning stretch of the state. Without those voters, it is unclear whether there\u2019s still a path to victory for Democrats seeking federal office. Yet the polls show a close race. So long as that\u2019s true, Ms. Grimes can\u2019t be counted out. Still, most surveys show Ms. Grimes, Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state, polling in the low-to-mid 40s. That\u2019s not bad, but each of the last three Democratic Senate candidates in Kentucky reached 44 percent of the vote. To win, Ms. Grimes needs to make inroads into Kentucky\u2019s Republican-leaning voters, and, so far, it hasn\u2019t happened. Campaigns tend to move partisans toward their respective corners. Campaign advertisements, messages, and even gaffes, emphasize the ideological differences between the candidates and polarize voters along party lines. Mr. McConnell will spend the next eight months reminding voters that he\u2019s the president\u2019s most reliable adversary, and that control of the Senate is at stake. That message seems likely to resonate with Kentucky\u2019s anti-Obama electorate.

        "content": "Here\u2019s our story so far: Sarah Palin is picked to run for vice president, builds up a big fan club of disgruntled, right wing Americans and loses. She returns briefly to Alaska, but then finds the job of running a state that lives off federal dollars and oil revenue too taxing and not nearly lucrative enough. She quits, writes a smash best seller, charges who knows what for public appearances, and keeps her celebrity going by pretending for a while to be thinking about running for president. I was highly critical of John McCain\u2019s choice of Ms. Palin in 2008, and found her \u201cI\u2019m an American, you\u2019re not\u201d tone grating and insulting. She represented an inchoate anger among voters that has been fostered by the Republican Party for decades as an electoral ploy\u2014as well as a willful ignorance about the world that is not my favorite American trait.\n\n\n\nBut you\u2019ve got to say this about Sarah Palin: she hangs in there when it comes to being a celebrity. On Monday, she gave an interview to a reliable and unabashed admirer, Eric Bolling of Fox News, who said that everyone he knows wants her to run. He pointed out that it\u2019s \u201cnot too late.\u201d Ms. Palin did not exactly wave her hand and say, well, gee, if everyone insists on me running for the White House, I might just have to. But she did say, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not too late for folks to jump in.\u201d And then she came out with the perfect anti-Shermanesque statement:\u00a0\u201c And I don\u2019t know, you know, it\u2014who knows what will happen in the future?\u201d Ms. Palin had a lot of other things to say\u2014about people who don\u2019t believe in Jesus and how they\u2019re trying to ruin Christmas, about how incompetent she thinks President Obama is and, of course, since all Republican conservatives are required to say this, how great Ronald Reagan was. She was, as always, full of folksy aphorisms \u2013 \u201cgrace runs downhill to the humble;\u201d the need to make sure \u201cwe\u2019re sweeping our own porch.\u201d She also had this to say: \u201chere, in North Korea, babies are reliant on China.\u201d The interview left me curious as to what Ms. Palin means by \u201chere,\u201d and it made me realize I that miss her. She\u2019s far more entertaining than the current crop of Republicans, especially now that Herman Cain\u2019s out. I hope she jumps right into the race and runs downhill with a broom to clean up the awful mess those North Korean babies left on our porch.",

        "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders and his advisers were not anxious before the first three televised primary debates, confident in his ability to champion his ideas and dubious that the debates would dramatically change how voters regarded him. But his aides know the next debate will be different: When he takes the stage on Tuesday night, two weeks after suffering a heart attack, he will have to convince voters that he is strong enough to carry the party\u2019s challenge to President Trump next fall. Since he experienced chest pains on Oct. 1 at an event in Las Vegas and had two stents inserted to clear a blocked artery, Mr. Sanders, 78, has remained off the campaign trail, first recovering at a hospital and then at his home in Burlington, Vt. News that his campaign had waited several days to reveal his diagnosis of a heart attack \u2014 and the limited medical details that they have released since \u2014 has also raised questions of transparency and contributed to speculation about his condition. His campaign has not made his doctors available for interviews, and while Mr. Sanders has pledged to release his medical records, he has not yet done so. His health issues have cast a degree of uncertainty over his campaign and left his aides rushing to reassure voters about his age and health, just as he was trying to improve his standing in a race that in recent weeks has become more of a two-person contest between Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. But if debates are an endurance test for all candidates, Tuesday\u2019s event has now taken on new urgency for Mr. Sanders, as he seeks to dispel doubts and show a national audience that he is physically capable of competing for the Democratic nomination. \u201cHe\u2019s got to step back onto the stage and show that he\u2019s vigorous and healthful,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a Democratic strategist who worked for Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign in 2016 but left his team earlier this year. \u201cI think he has only one objective in this debate, and that\u2019s just to show that he\u2019s healthy.\u201d Mr. Sanders has been preparing for the debate at his home in Burlington, where he has largely followed his typical pre-debate playbook: Rather than conducting intensive drills and mock debates \u2014 which he and his team generally do not view as productive given how many candidates will be onstage \u2014 Mr. Sanders has been having conversations with his close advisers, including his wife, Jane Sanders, about policy and his record. At Mr. Sanders\u2019s insistence, however, much of his debate preparations this time have occurred outdoors, in his backyard, according to a campaign official. He has alternated between sitting and standing, and during breaks, he has gone for walks or batted around a baseball to build up his endurance. Aides have said they expect Mr. Sanders to come across as energetic as ever and have rebuffed questions about whether he can handle standing for so long onstage. But they also allow that Mr. Sanders, his health and his appearance will be under intense scrutiny. (During the last debate, he struggled with a hoarse voice.) His team expects the topic of his heart attack to come up at the debate and anticipates he will be asked about it by the moderators. Mike Casca, a spokesman for the Sanders campaign, said in a statement that Mr. Sanders \u201cwill do what he\u2019s always done\u201d at the debate. \u201cI promise the pressure of doing right by the working class on Tuesday night is bigger than any boring conventional wisdom about the importance of his \u2018performance\u2019 pushed by political pundits in D.C.,\u201d Mr. Casca said. He added that \u201cthe solidarity forged over the last two weeks is going to make his coalition stronger.\u201d Several staff members, almost verbatim, have said the episode, though initially concerning, has empowered them with a new feeling of resolve, heightening the sense of unity. \u201cMore grateful than ever to be part of the @BernieSanders movement and family,\u201d Josh Orton, a senior adviser, wrote on Twitter on Saturday. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign recently said it had raised $25.3 million between July and September, more than any other candidate, which has also helped buoy morale. Officials describe the strategy going forward as business as usual. The campaign has continued to release policy plans, including one on Monday aimed at \u201ccorporate greed and corruption\u201d that proposes giving workers 45 percent of the seats on their corporate boards. While Mr. Sanders recovers, an army of surrogates has fanned out across the country to make his case for him. Last week, he released a seven-minute, direct-to-supporter video reaffirming his commitment to his political revolution and to overcoming adversity. He has promised to continue his fight, especially for his signature policy proposal, \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Campaign leaders have been providing campaign updates and rallying staffers on conference calls. The campaign is also attempting to portray his return to the campaign trail as a comeback story, and will hold a \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally next weekend in New York City. To the extent he has talked about his heart trouble, he has framed it as a common medical episode that many people have experienced. \u201cPeople are back on their feet pretty soon, as is the case with me,\u201d he said in an interview that aired on ABC News on Sunday. In that interview he also drew an explicit contrast to Ms. Warren, a tactic he has mostly avoided. \u201cElizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I\u2019m not,\u201d he said in response to a question about what he would say to voters who might prefer Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, because she is younger and did not just have a heart attack. His campaign, though eager to highlight how Mr. Sanders differs philosophically from Ms. Warren, said the comment did not reflect a broader change in strategy. Yet despite his campaign\u2019s projection of optimism, the episode has also exposed the uncertain nature over this next phase of his candidacy. Speaking to reporters last week, Mr. Sanders, who was known for keeping a grueling schedule on the campaign trail, said he intended to \u201cchange the nature\u201d of his campaign, holding fewer events than he had previously. But aides immediately downplayed his remarks and by the next day, Mr. Sanders told NBC News that he had \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he implied he would be slowing his pace and vowed to \u201cget back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign.\u201d Several staffers, however, said they were relieved he would be reducing the number of events, even if the slowdown was only temporary.",

        "content": "  Just over three months before Iowans caucus for Democratic presidential candidates, four polls out this week present a muddled picture of a primary race that is unfolding in varying, and sometimes conflicting, ways nationally and in early-voting states. A pair of new national polls present starkly different results. A CNN survey released Wednesday had former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. with a commanding lead of 15 percentage points ahead of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. But a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday had Ms. Warren as the front-runner, seven points ahead of Mr. Biden. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont finished a strong third in both national polls, suggesting that his standing in the race has not been diminished by his heart attack earlier this month \u2014 and that he may have been buoyed by endorsements from Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. Two other polls from early-voting states show a tight race in Iowa and Mr. Biden maintaining a comfortable lead in South Carolina. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., continued to show particular strength in Iowa, earning third place and 13 percent support in the Suffolk University/USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats released on Monday. Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is now staking her campaign on a top-three finish there, was in a four-way tie for fifth in that poll with 3 percent support. It is not clear why the CNN and Quinnipiac polls present such divergent results for Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden. But the polls, both considered to be of high quality and able to help candidates qualify for the next Democratic debate, add data points to a divide that has emerged in recent weeks: between surveys that show Mr. Biden with a commanding lead, and those that have him in a statistical dead heat with Ms. Warren. A number of things can affect a poll\u2019s results, including the wording of a horse-race question and the order that items are asked. In CNN and Fox News polls\u00a0this year, respondents have typically been asked for their opinions on each of the Democratic presidential candidates, among other questions, before being queried about their vote preference. In Quinnipiac\u2019s polls \u2014\u00a0as well as those conducted by Monmouth University, which have also shown Ms. Warren climbing steadily \u2014 people have not typically been asked to evaluate the candidates one-by-one before giving their vote choice. If such small differences in survey structure are indeed having an effect on results, it may reflect the fact that many respondents are not yet certain about their feelings. The CNN poll released this week brought that point home, finding that a majority of Democratic voters who favored one candidate \u2014 53 percent \u2014 said they could still change their mind about whom to support for the nomination. \u201cIt makes me think that voters are not settled, that they\u2019re still shopping for a candidate \u2014 that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing some movement between polls,\u201d Doug Schwartz, Quinnipiac\u2019s polling director, said Thursday in a telephone interview. The Quinnipiac poll also qualified Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota for the debate next month in Georgia, making her the ninth candidate to do so. Candidates must meet a donor requirement set by the Democratic National Committee as well as a polling requirement; Ms. Klobuchar, who is getting a second look after a strong performance in the October debate, received 3 percent support in the Quinnipiac survey and two others this week, giving her a total of four qualifying polls and securing her spot in the debate next month. National polls can offer a snapshot of the Democratic electorate\u2019s mood, and the extent to which a candidate\u2019s debate performance has helped or hurt a campaign. The Quinnipiac poll, which had a margin of error of five percentage points, said Ms. Warren had registered 28 percent support compared with 21 percent for Mr. Biden. Mr. Biden\u2019s support in the survey was down six points from a similar national poll that Quinnipiac released 10 days earlier and was conducted before the October debate; Ms. Warren\u2019s support was around the same in that poll. Support for Mr. Sanders rose slightly in the post-debate poll, to 15 percent, while Mr. Buttigieg remained in fourth place with 10 percent. The CNN poll, which had a margin of error of four percentage points, put Mr. Biden\u2019s support at 34 percent and Ms. Warren\u2019s at 19 percent. It seemed to add credibility to the results coming out of Fox News and other polling operations, which have consistently shown Mr. Biden alone at the front of the Democratic pack. Members of CNN\u2019s polling team declined to comment about the results of their latest survey. At the state level, the Suffolk University/USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats showed Mr. Biden in the lead with 18 percent support, Ms. Warren just behind him with 17 percent, Mr. Buttigieg next with 13 percent and Mr. Sanders finishing fourth with just 9 percent support. The outcome of Iowa voters\u2019 caucus in February could influence South Carolina voters, who go to the polls about four weeks later. Throughout the primary, Mr. Biden has held on to a steady and sizable lead in the polls there. The Monmouth University poll out of South Carolina this week showed his support there dipping to 33 percent this month from 39 percent in July, but Ms. Warren still finished a distant second with 16 percent support. Mark Blumenthal, an independent pollster who has advised Democratic candidates, pointed out that turnout in presidential primaries and caucuses is generally quite low \u2014 sometimes under 1 percent in some state contests. For this reason, the results of any survey that polls all registered Democratic voters nationwide is bound to capture many people who will not in fact participate. \u201cThe big challenge of polling in any election is measuring a population that doesn\u2019t yet exist,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. That is true of \u201cpresidential primaries in particular \u2014 because they\u2019re a small fraction of the larger population and because they\u2019re these very high-profile events where the composition can change dramatically from election to election.\u201d \u201cOdds are good,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal added, \u201cthese results will converge as we get closer to voting.\u201d",

        "author": "Dave Philipps",
        "date": "Nov. 19, 2019",
        "content": " [Update: President Trump on Thursday reversed a Navy decision to oust Edward Gallagher from SEALs.] The Navy SEAL at the center of a high-profile war crimes case has been ordered to appear before Navy leaders Wednesday morning, and is expected to be notified that the Navy intends to oust him from the elite commando force, two Navy officials said on Tuesday. The move could put the SEAL commander, Rear Adm. Collin Green, in direct conflict with President Trump, who last week cleared the sailor, Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, of any judicial punishment in the war crimes case. Military leaders opposed that action as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s pardons of two soldiers involved in other murder cases. Navy officials had planned to begin the process of taking away Chief Gallagher\u2019s Trident pin, the symbol of his membership in the SEALs, earlier this month. But as he waited outside his commander\u2019s office, Navy leaders sought clearance from the White House that never came, and no action was taken. Admiral Green now has the authorization he needs from the Navy to act against Chief Gallagher, and the formal letter notifying the chief of the action has been drafted by the admiral, the two officials said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the impending action. The Navy also plans to take the Tridents of three SEAL officers who oversaw Chief Gallagher \u2014 Lt. Cmdr. Robert Breisch, Lt. Jacob Portier and Lt. Thomas MacNeil \u2014\u00a0and their letters have been drafted as well, one of the officials said. Under Navy regulations, a SEAL\u2019s Trident can be taken if a commander loses \u201cfaith and confidence in the service member\u2019s ability to exercise sound judgment, reliability and personal conduct.\u201d The Navy has removed 154 Tridents since 2011. Removing a Trident does not entail a reduction in rank, but it effectively ends a SEAL\u2019s career. Since Chief Gallagher and Lieutenant Portier both planned to leave the Navy soon in any case, the step would have little practical effect on them. But in a warrior culture that prizes honor and prestige, the rebuke would still cast the men out of a tight-knit brotherhood. \u201cTo have a commander remove that pin after a guy has gone through so much to earn it, it is pretty much the worst thing you could do,\u201d said Eric Deming, a retired senior chief who served 19 years in the SEALs. \u201cYou are having your whole identity taken away.\u201d \u201cWhy would they do it to someone like Gallagher?\u201d said Mr. Deming, who is not involved in the case. \u201cI think the leadership feels like they have lost the trust of the American people and want to rebuild it. So they are trying to show guys will be held accountable.\u201d [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive articles about duty, conflict and consequence.] The move sets up a potential confrontation between Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly championed Chief Gallagher, and Admiral Green, who has said he intends to overhaul discipline and ethics in the SEAL teams and sees Chief Gallagher\u2019s behavior as an obstacle. One Navy official who spoke about the specifics of the action said the admiral was making the move knowing that it could end his career, but that he had the backing of Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, and Richard V. Spencer, the secretary of the Navy. Asked about Admiral Gilday, his spokesman, Cmdr. Nate Christensen, said on Tuesday that the admiral \u201csupports his commanders in executing their roles, to include Rear Admiral Green.\u201d Chief Gallagher\u2019s lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, said that punishing the chief after the president cleared him last week would amount to insubordination. \u201cDoes Admiral Green have the authority to do it? Yes,\u201d Mr. Parlatore said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut how tone-deaf is the guy? The commander in chief\u2019s intent is crystal clear, that he wants Eddie left alone.\u201d Mr. Parlatore said he expected Mr. Trump to order the Navy to restore Chief Gallagher\u2019s Trident if it is removed, and to dismiss Admiral Green from command. Chief Gallagher has been at the center of a whipsaw war crimes case for more than a year. He was arrested and jailed in 2018 on war-crimes charges including shooting unarmed civilians in Iraq and killing a wounded teenage captive with a hunting knife. A military jury acquitted him in July of all the charges except a minor one of posing for a trophy photo with the captive\u2019s corpse; for that crime, he was demoted and faced the possibility of further sanctions. Mr. Trump restored his rank on Friday. \u201cI had a feeling that it was coming because, you know, the president has shown the nation he was a man of his word,\u201d Chief Gallagher said in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cHe knew a lot about all the injustices that went on through this whole ordeal I went through.\u201d Navy officials contend that, independent of the criminal charges, Chief Gallagher\u2019s behavior during and since the deployment has fallen below the standard of the SEALs. A Navy investigation uncovered evidence that he had been buying and using narcotics. Since his acquittal, Chief Gallagher has trolled the Navy on social media, taunting the SEALs who testified against him; mocking one who wept as he told investigators about witnessing the stabbing of the captive; insulting the Naval Criminal Investigative Service; and calling top SEAL commanders, including Admiral Green, \u201ca bunch of morons.\u201d The cases of Chief Gallagher and the three officers will be submitted to a review board, who will decide whether to follow the admiral\u2019s recommendation that they be ejected from the force. The process, which can take several weeks, almost always results in the SEAL\u2019s Trident being taken, according to Patrick Korody, a former Navy prosecutor. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone beat it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn cases like this, I don\u2019t know if you could find anyone who would go against the admiral\u2019s recommendation.\u201d For all four men, the review board\u2019s decision is likely to center on the allegations that Chief Gallagher committed murder during a 2017 deployment to Iraq. In court testimony, multiple SEALs in his platoon said that they reported one killing the day it happened, and several times after that as well, but that the platoon commander, Lieutenant Portier, did not forward the report up the chain of command as required by regulations. Lieutenant Portier was criminally charged with failing to report the murder; he denied the charges, and they were dropped after Chief Gallagher was acquitted. Commander Breisch was the troop commander over Chief Gallagher and Lieutenant Portier in Iraq. SEALs in the platoon testified that they told him repeatedly about the killings after the deployment, but were told to \u201cdecompress\u201d and \u201clet it go,\u201d according to a Navy investigation. Commander Breisch was not charged. Lieutenant MacNeil was the most junior officer in the platoon, and was one of the SEALs who reported Chief Gallagher for murder and testified at his trial. During the proceedings, though, it was revealed that Lieutenant MacNeil had done nothing to stop the chief from posing for a trophy photo with the head of the dead teenage captive he was accused of stabbing, and had posed for the photo as well. At trial it was also revealed that Lieutenant MacNeil had been drinking with enlisted SEALs in Iraq, in violation of regulations. The president has the authority to stop or reverse any decision concerning the SEALs\u2019 Tridents, according to Eugene R. Fidell, who teaches military justice at Yale Law School. But for generations, he said, presidents have generally refrained from inserting themselves into the military\u2019s personnel decisions. \u201cThe president is the commander in chief; he could give orders about how to peel the potatoes in the chow hall if he wanted,\u201d Mr. Fidell said. \u201cThe question is, should he?\u201d Regarding Chief Gallagher\u2019s Trident, he said: \u201cA reasonable observer could say this is a completely inappropriate intrusion into the military. If Trump saves his Trident \u2014 and I\u2019d bet on it \u2014 I would say he will have driven the wedge ever deeper into an already divided military. And that can\u2019t be helpful.\u201d",

        "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 If life in the White House has prematurely aged President Obama, his vital statistics do not show it. Mr. Obama\u2019s latest medical report shows him to be five pounds lighter than he was at the time of his last physical exam, in June 2014, with a slower resting heart beat, lower blood pressure and a reduced cholesterol level. Mr. Obama, 54, was examined by Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, last month. Dr. Jackson said that Mr. Obama no longer smoked but occasionally used nicotine gum. Mr. Obama takes Nexium for \u201coccasional acid reflux symptoms,\u201d as well as daily vitamin D tablets. Here are the highlights of the two-page report. WEIGHT: 175 pounds. Presidential basketball games are a thing of the past, but Mr. Obama remains a fitness enthusiast, working out regularly at the White House and on the road. (The early-morning motorcade from the hotel to the gym is a regular occurrence.) Dr. Jackson cited exercise as the reason for an \u201cimproved lean body mass.\u201d In 2014, it was 23.7 kilograms per meter squared; now it is 22.8 kilograms per meter squared. HEART RATE: 56 beats a minute. It\u2019s not as if the president\u2019s job is becoming less stressful, but Mr. Obama appears able to remain calm amid the swirl. In 2014, his resting heart rate was 62 beats a minute, or about 10 percent faster. BLOOD PRESSURE: 110/68. There has been plenty to make the president\u2019s blood pressure rise over the past year or so: foreign policy crises, a recalcitrant Congress, and Donald J. Trump. But his blood pressure has dipped a bit, from 112/70. CHOLESTEROL: 188 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Mr. Obama has frequently said he likes a good plate of nachos with guacamole. But it looks as if he has been listening more to his nutrition-conscious wife, Michelle. His cholesterol level has dropped significantly since 2014, when it was 213. And there is no indication that Mr. Obama is taking cholesterol-lowering medications. Dr. Jackson attributed the improvement to the exercise and to \u201chis adherence to a healthy diet.\u201d",

        "content": " For months, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has made \u201cbig, structural change,\u201d the rallying cry of her presidential campaign. And when it comes to the tech sector, that has meant taking square aim at giant companies like Facebook \u2014 companies she says have become so large that they are stifling competition. Ms. Warren rolled out a proposal to break up Facebook, Amazon and other tech giants in March. To ensure that tech workers got her message, her campaign paid for a billboard near a major transit station in San Francisco. It read \u201cBreak Up Big Tech,\u201d in capital letters. On Tuesday, nearly seven months after Ms. Warren first unveiled her plan, The Verge offered a window into what Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, thinks about it. In leaked audio recordings of open meetings with employees this summer, Mr. Zuckerberg can be heard saying that the company would sue if Ms. Warren were to enact the plan as president. \u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. That\u2019s not like the position you want to be in. We care about our country and want to work with our government to do good things,\u201d he added. \u201cBut look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d Shortly after The Verge published Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks, Ms. Warren responded by renewing her criticism of Facebook. \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck,\u2019\u201d she said, mimicking Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s language, \u201cis if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d The surfacing of grievances between Ms. Warren and Mr. Zuckerberg has the effect of publicly pitting one of the leading Democratic candidates for president against the head of the world\u2019s largest social network, at a time when Silicon Valley in general and Facebook in particular continue to be scrutinized for their efforts to combat disinformation and prevent election interference in 2020 and beyond. In the audio recording clipped and published by The Verge, Mr. Zuckerberg ties his criticism of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan to concerns about election interference. \u201cIt\u2019s just that breaking up these companies, whether it\u2019s Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, you know, it doesn\u2019t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can\u2019t coordinate and work together.\u201d After the leaked audio was published and Ms. Warren responded, Mr. Zuckerberg commented on the episode in a Facebook post. \u201cEvery week I do a Q&A at Facebook where employees get to ask me anything and I share openly what I\u2019m thinking on all kinds of projects and issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThe transcript from one of my Q&As a few months ago just got published online \u2014 and even though it was meant to be internal rather than public, now that it\u2019s out there, you can check it out if you\u2019re interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I\u2019m thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics.\u201d Ms. Warren, meanwhile, used the renewed focus on the issue as an opportunity to reiterate that she is \u201cnot afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable.\u201d In her proposal, Ms. Warren argues that the tech giants have essentially developed monopolies \u2014 they have \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\u201d Her plan calls for legislation that would prohibit platforms like Amazon from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace; appointing regulators to undo some tech mergers; and rolling back some acquisitions by tech giants, such as Facebook\u2019s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram. Later Tuesday, she pressed the issue, firing off a five-tweet thread that began: \u201cLet\u2019s talk a bit about my plan to #BreakUpBigTech and why it\u2019s got Mark Zuckerberg so worked up.\u201d \u201cFacebook is doing pretty well right now,\u201d Ms. Warren said, citing its acquisitions as evidence that tech companies had amassed significant power and face little competition. \u201cImagine Facebook and Instagram trying to outdo each other to protect your privacy and keep misinformation out of your feed, instead of working together to sell your data, inundate you with misinformation, and undermine our election security,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to #BreakUpBigTech.\u201d By offering a steady diet of detailed policy proposals, Ms. Warren has grown her following significantly and risen to the top of the polls. Her plans to reshape the government extend to areas like the economy and education, where she has called for a wealth tax and canceling student loan debt. \u201cWe have these giant corporations \u2014 do I have to tell that to people in Long Island City? \u2014 that think they can roll over everyone,\u201d Ms. Warren told a crowd there earlier this year, after Amazon pulled out of plans to build a new campus in the neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019m sick of freeloading billionaires.\u201d",

        "content": " CHICAGO \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019s not welcome in our city,\u201d said Pam Capraro, 65, as she walked along the Chicago River to join a chanting, singing, sign-waving, occasionally sousaphone-playing crowd outside the Trump International Hotel & Tower. \u201cHe represents everything that Chicago isn\u2019t \u2014 racism, sexism, xenophobia.\u201d She flicked her hand dismissively in the direction of the Trump building, where the president\u2019s name is emblazoned in jumbo letters on one of its glassy sides. \u201cWhy is that even here?\u201d On Monday, President Trump arrived in Chicago for the first visit of his presidency, delivering a speech to a conference of police chiefs that denounced the city in biting and personal terms. He called the values of Chicago\u2019s police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, who had pointedly skipped the president\u2019s address, a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d He criticized the city\u2019s open stance toward immigrants. He said Chicago was notorious around the globe for its violence. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to us as a nation,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAll over the world, they\u2019re talking about Chicago.\u201d In Chicago, where Mr. Trump won less than 13 percent of the vote in 2016, residents responded with equal contempt, gathering by the thousands outside his curvy skyscraper on the river downtown, where he later attended a private fund-raiser. Protesters hoisted rainbow-colored letters spelling \u201cResist\u201d with the famous corncob-shaped Marina City towers standing in the background. Some in attendance wore red, the color representing Chicago\u2019s public schoolteachers, who have been on strike for eight days in a dispute with the city administration. One man held a small sign to his chest that simply read \u201cGo away.\u201d The police shut down entire blocks of Upper Wacker Drive, one of downtown\u2019s major thoroughfares, leaving the Loop unusually choked with traffic. Marsha Durbin, a registered nurse who lives in Indiana and wore a Trump T-shirt, said she was determined to defend the president\u2019s name in the face of an overwhelmingly liberal crowd. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would have globalism without him. And thank God he\u2019s here addressing the violence problem.\u201d But for many Chicagoans, the gathering had a cathartic, festive feel, with a brass band playing, children dancing and many in the crowd chanting in praise of their city. (\u201cWhat city protects democracy? Chicago!\u201d) Ian Wallace, a 38-year-old stay-at-home parent from the Old Town neighborhood whose children attend public elementary school, said he was drawn to the protest to stand against Mr. Trump, his policies and his frequent attacks on Chicago. \u201cWe wanted to show our disappointment with him,\u201d Mr. Wallace said beside three of his children. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of negative things you hear about Chicago, and it\u2019s almost always from someone who doesn\u2019t live here. We love our city.\u201d Mr. Trump in recent weeks has been showing up in places where he is unpopular, including the San Francisco Bay Area and Minneapolis, and in his brief day trip to Chicago on Monday, he mostly avoided its residents in favor of out-of-town conference attendees. Last week, Mr. Johnson, the superintendent, said he did not plan to attend Mr. Trump\u2019s speech to police leaders because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t line up with our city\u2019s core values, along with my personal values.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience stand by while racial insults and hatred are cast from the Oval Office, or Chicago is held hostage because of our views on New Americans,\u201d he said in a statement. Speaking to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Johnson\u2019s values and said he protected illegal immigrants in a violent city. \u201cHere\u2019s a man that could not bother to show up for a meeting of police chiefs, the most respected people in the country, in his hometown and with the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd you know why? It\u2019s because he\u2019s not doing his job.\u201d Mr. Johnson called a news conference to rebut Mr. Trump, pointing out that homicides and shootings have seen double-digit percentage declines in recent years. Chicago has more murders than Los Angeles or New York does, but it has significantly fewer than it did in 2016, when there were 762 murders in the city. \u201cToday, the same police officers the president criticized for their inability to protect this city spent all day protecting him,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. Mayor Lori Lightfoot chimed in on Twitter: \u201cRather than belittle Chicago\u2019s communities with hateful and dishonest rhetoric, he needs to go back to D.C. and face his fate.\u201d Mr. Trump has frequently criticized Chicago and its crime rate, but he had avoided the city since being elected. In March 2016, he planned a rally in the city but, facing heavy protests, canceled it just before it was scheduled to begin.",

        "content": " Joseph R. Biden Jr. unfurled sharply personal new lines of attack against Senator Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday, questioning her contributions to the Democratic Party and seeking to cast her as an elitist who believes people lack courage or wisdom unless they agree with her. \u201cSome call it the \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach to politics,\u201d Mr. Biden, the former vice president, wrote in a Medium post. \u201cBut it\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view. It\u2019s representative of an elitism that working and middle-class people do not share: \u2018We know best; you know nothing.\u2019 \u2018If you were only as smart as I am you would agree with me.\u2019 This is no way to get anything done.\u201d Mr. Biden repeated similar arguments in a fund-raising email and at a fund-raiser in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, escalating tensions between the two top-polling contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination. He did not mention his rival by name, but the message was unmistakably aimed at Ms. Warren, whose Republican critics have for years sought to paint her as an out-of-touch liberal who worked as a Harvard professor. Ms. Warren is running as a corruption-battling economic populist, and her campaign has emphasized that she grew up in Oklahoma \u201con the ragged edge of the middle-class.\u201d Her campaign declined to comment on Mr. Biden\u2019s remarks. Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have clashed repeatedly over health care, especially as Ms. Warren has overtaken Mr. Biden in some early-state polls. Ms. Warren supports \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d an expansive government-run health insurance system that would all but eliminate private health insurance, while Mr. Biden wants to add a \u201cpublic option\u201d to build on the Affordable Care Act, but still allow people to choose private insurance. Last week, after Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign criticized Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal to pay for Medicare for all, she suggested that Mr. Biden was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d \u201cDemocrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies who don\u2019t want to see any change in the law that will bite into their profit,\u201d she said. Her message drew a pointed rebuke from Mr. Biden, who wrote that such remarks \u201creflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn\u2019t agree with you \u2014 it\u2019s not just that you disagree \u2014 that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.\u201d Some of Ms. Warren\u2019s other opponents, including Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have also been critical of Ms. Warren\u2019s health care proposal, and of her approach to promoting it. In several venues on Tuesday, Mr. Biden also repeatedly seized on the fact that Ms. Warren was once a registered Republican, though she is now a leading progressive contender for the Democratic nomination and Mr. Biden is perceived by many on the left as too moderate and overly focused on striking deals with Republicans. \u201cI have fought for the Democratic Party my whole career,\u201d Mr. Biden wrote. \u201cI know what we stand for, who we stand with and what we believe. And it\u2019s not just policies or issues. It\u2019s in my bones. That\u2019s not something everyone in this primary can say.\u201d He was more explicit at the fund-raiser: \u201cI\u2019ve been a Democrat my whole life. This person has only fairly recently in the mid-\u201990s become a Democrat.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s team has in the past been critical of Mr. Biden\u2019s reliance on high-dollar fund-raising events. Mr. Biden and his allies often bristle at the suggestion that he is insufficiently progressive for this moment in the Democratic Party, and Mr. Biden on Tuesday sought to defend his liberal credentials on issues like health care and taxes. But his use of personal criticisms to confront Ms. Warren, the only woman polling in the top tier of Democratic contenders, carries risk. Attacks on character, including on Mr. Biden\u2019s, have often failed to land or have backfired in the primary process so far. Mr. Biden cast his remarks as self-defense. \u201cSince some have questioned whether I\u2019m running in the wrong primary \u2014 let me answer that question,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m running in the Democratic primary as a proud Democrat.\u201d",

        "content": "  KEENE, N.H. \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s message on impeachment was blunt and brief. On a college campus here, Ms. Warren reminded a crowd of hundreds that she had called for President Trump\u2019s impeachment last spring, after the release of Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Taking action against Mr. Trump, she said then, was \u201ca matter of constitutional responsibility.\u201d \u201cIf Congress does not hold this man accountable, then he will break the law again and again and again,\u201d Ms. Warren said Wednesday. \u201cIt is time for impeachment now.\u201d She said she was pleased the House of Representatives had \u201cstepped up\u201d and expressed hope the process would move \u201cquickly.\u201d And then, less than three minutes after she began speaking, Ms. Warren turned away from the subject. Ms. Warren was not the only Democrat on Wednesday to attempt such a balancing act, as other candidates blended urgent denunciations of Mr. Trump with broader arguments for their own campaigns. Across the Democratic field, candidates are approaching the impeachment battle stirring in Washington as a matter to be addressed but also contained \u2014 a necessary process, but perhaps not one that ought to redefine their own campaigns. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont released a statement labeling Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cself-dealing and corruption\u201d as \u201climitless,\u201d and praising the House for formally opening an impeachment inquiry. But he also tweeted about homelessness and outsourced jobs after walking on a picket line in Michigan. Senator Kamala Harris of California said in interview that she was shocked by the summary of a phone call the president made to the leader of Ukraine in which he urged his counterpart to investigate one of his political rivals, Joseph R. Biden Jr. But she also said her candidacy would remain focused on the scope of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency and not a single episode or the impeachment question narrowly. And Mr. Biden, who held no public events on Wednesday, issued his own statement saying he would be focused \u201cnot on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America\u2019s families.\u201d Candidates like Ms. Warren may have the stature to communicate with voters over the din of impeachment. She has risen rapidly in the polls in recent weeks, threatening to overtake Mr. Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Ms. Warren was the first of the major Democratic candidates to demand Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment, but mentions Mr. Trump sparingly in her speeches. Even she is declining to transform her campaign into a crusade for his ouster. Democratic voters, too, appear not to be focused with singular intensity on impeachment: Ms. Warren\u2019s rhetoric on the matter drew loud applause, but no louder than the crowd\u2019s reaction to her arguments about climate change, racial inequality and government corruption. Among the people in Ms. Warren\u2019s audience, there was a sense of outrage about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and a sense of support for the steps taken this week by House Democrats to investigate him more aggressively. But there was little optimism that Mr. Trump might ultimately be removed from office, and some expressed anxiety at the unpredictability of the impeachment process. Tim Butterworth, a retired teacher who is supporting Ms. Warren, said he believed the House had a duty to proceed with impeachment even though there was \u201ckind of a stone wall\u201d waiting in the Republican-controlled Senate. Mr. Butterworth did not mention Ms. Warren\u2019s support for impeachment among his reasons for supporting her, focusing instead on her plans for addressing economic inequality. \u201cI think it would be easier to defeat him in an election,\u201d Mr. Butterworth, 75, said of the president. \u201cBut when you see a crime being committed, you have to report it. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re complicit.\u201d Ellen Moran, an undecided voter who works in urgent care, expressed both exasperation with Mr. Trump and some trepidation about impeachment. Ms. Moran, who is deciding between Ms. Warren and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., said it was \u201cembarrassing, frankly, as an American that we have to come down to this.\u201d Earlier in the day, Ms. Warren was one of at least two candidates, along with the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who labeled the reconstruction of the phone call a \u201csmoking gun.\u201d The call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is at the center of accusations that Mr. Trump pressured a foreign leader to open a potential corruption investigation tied to Mr. Biden, who is seeking to challenge Mr. Trump in 2020. The news of the call \u2014 which was first revealed by a whistle-blower who works in the intelligence community \u2014 prompted House Democrats to say on Tuesday they would formally open an impeachment inquiry. The rapid developments in Washington provided a rare chance for most of the 19 Democratic candidates to offer a unified response in a primary that has increasingly seen them draw distinctions with each other in an attempt to stand out. The near-uniform embrace of an impeachment inquiry represents a significant shift from this spring, after the release of the report by the special counsel, Mr. Mueller, on Russian interference in the 2016 election, when fewer candidates explicitly endorsed beginning an impeachment inquiry. Poll after poll has shown that Democratic voters\u2019 top priority is beating Mr. Trump in the 2020 general election, and the allegations that he pressured a foreign leader in an effort to hurt a political rival have enabled the candidates to collectively paint him as unfit to occupy the presidency. In the interview, Ms. Harris said the time for impeachment had come. \u201cThis guy has told us who he is,\u201d she said. \u201cHe believes he\u2019s above the law. And everything that has happened in these years continues to tell us that.\u201d Her campaign on Wednesday also highlighted the role of Attorney General William P. Barr in the various controversies surrounding Mr. Trump. Ms. Harris\u2019s communications director resurfaced an exchange between Ms. Harris and Mr. Barr during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in May about Mr. Mueller\u2019s report, in which she asked the attorney general whether Mr. Trump had ever asked him to open an investigation into anyone else. After much hesitation, Mr. Barr said he did not know. In the interview, Ms. Harris, a former prosecutor who ran California\u2019s Department of Justice, raised concerns about the fact that Mr. Trump had urged Mr. Zelensky to contact Mr. Barr about opening an investigation. \u201cIs he using his power in a way that\u2019s for political advantage rather than the pursuit of justice?\u201d Ms. Harris asked. \u201cYes, I have a question about where is this attorney general\u2019s loyalty, and to whom, and to what end.\u201d Not every candidate in the Democratic primary supports an impeachment inquiry. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who has long opposed that remedy, argued Tuesday on Fox News that \u201cimpeachment at this juncture would be terribly divisive for the country.\u201d And on Wednesday, she said that seeing the reconstructed transcript had not changed her mind. \u201cMost people reading through that transcript are not going to find that extremely compelling cause to throw out a president,\u201d she said. Most of the rest of the Democratic candidates however were unequivocal in their calls for an impeachment investigation to begin. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said that the memo on the phone call was \u201capparent proof that Trump had pressured a foreign nation to meddle in our democracy again.\u201d \u201cHistory will remember those who put politics aside at this time of crisis and treated it like the moral moment that it is,\u201d he said. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that the record of the call was \u201cdeeply disturbing,\u201d adding that Mr. Trump had \u201cviolated the public\u2019s trust.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s shameful,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country deserves better.\u201d And Mr. Castro, in an interview, called Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct \u201cegregious.\u201d \u201cI want to see Donald Trump held accountable and for the House to move forward with impeachment,\u201d he said.",

        "content": " After Tom Casperson, a Republican state senator from Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, began running for Congress in 2016, he assumed the family of Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee to be education secretary, would not oppose him. The DeVoses, a dominant force in Michigan politics for decades with a fortune in the billions, had contributed to one of Mr. Casperson\u2019s earlier campaigns. But a week before his primary, family members sent $24,000 to one of his opponents, then poured $125,000 into a \u201csuper PAC,\u201d Concerned Taxpayers of America, that ran ads attacking him. The reason, an intermediary told Mr. Casperson: his support from organized labor. \u201cDeceitful, dishonest and cowardly,\u201d was how Mr. Casperson\u2019s campaign described the ads, complaining that the groups running them \u201cwon\u2019t say who they are or where their money is coming from.\u201d On Primary Day, Mr. Casperson went down to defeat. In announcing his intention to nominate Ms. DeVos, Mr. Trump described her as \u201ca brilliant and passionate education advocate.\u201d Even critics characterized her as a dedicated, if misguided, activist for school reform. But that description understates both the breadth of Ms. DeVos\u2019s political interests and the influence she wields as part of her powerful family. More than anyone else who has joined the incoming Trump administration, she represents the combination of wealth, free-market ideology and political hardball associated with a better-known family of billionaires: Charles and David Koch. \u201cThey have this moralized sense of the free market that leads to this total program to turn back the ideas of the New Deal, the welfare state,\u201d Kim Phillips-Fein, a historian who has written extensively about the conservative movement, said, describing the DeVoses. Ms. DeVos declined to be interviewed for this article. Like the Kochs, the DeVoses are generous supporters of think tanks that evangelize for unrestrained capitalism, like Michigan\u2019s Acton Institute, and that rail against unions and back privatizing public services, like the Mackinac Center. They have also funded national groups dedicated to cutting back the role of government, including the National Center for Policy Analysis (which has pushed for Social Security privatization and against environmental regulation) and the Institute for Justice (which challenges regulations in court and defends school vouchers). Both organizations have also received money from the Koch family. Indeed, the DeVoses\u2019 education activism, which favors alternatives to traditional public schools, appears to derive from the same free-market views that inform their suspicion of government. And perhaps more than other right-wing billionaires, the DeVoses couple their seeding of ideological causes with an aggressive brand of political spending. Half a dozen or more extended family members frequently coordinate contributions to maximize their impact. In the 2016 cycle alone, according to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, the family spent roughly $14 million on political contributions to state and national candidates, parties, PACs and super PACs. All of this would make Ms. DeVos \u2014 whose confirmation hearing has been delayed until next week amid mounting pressure that her government ethics review be completed beforehand \u2014 very different from past education secretaries. \u201cShe is the most emblematic kind of oligarchic figure you can put in a cabinet position,\u201d said Jeffrey Winters, a political scientist at Northwestern University who studies economic elites. \u201cWhat she and the Kochs have in common is the unbridled use of wealth power to achieve whatever political goals they have.\u201d Ms. DeVos, 59, grew up in Holland, Mich., the daughter of a conservative auto parts magnate who was an early funder of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group. When she married Dick DeVos in 1979, it was akin to a merger between two royal houses of western Michigan. Her husband\u2019s father, Richard Sr., co-founder of the multilevel marketing company Amway, was an active member of the Christian Reformed Church that preached a mix of social conservatism and self-reliance. He once told the church\u2019s official magazine that Chicago\u2019s poor dwelled in slums because that was \u201cthe way they choose to live,\u201d according to a Washington Post story from the 1980s. A fan of Rolls-Royces and pinkie rings, Richard Sr. wrote books with titles like \u201cTen Powerful Phrases for Positive People.\u201d A similar air hung over his business. Amway sales representatives, which the company calls \u201cindependent business owners,\u201d make money both by selling the company\u2019s products \u2014 everything from perfume to toilet bowl cleaner \u2014 and by recruiting other sales representatives. The Federal Trade Commission once investigated the company for running a pyramid scheme before concluding that it had misled potential recruits about how much they could expect to earn. The flip side of the family\u2019s proselytizing for capitalism, according to Professor Phillips-Fein, has been an effort to dismantle much \u201cthat would counterbalance the power of economic elites.\u201d Amway funded a nationwide ad campaign in the early 1980s, protesting high taxes and regulations. Not long after, the company pleaded guilty to cheating the Canadian government out of more than $20 million in revenue. The family had a more winning public face in Dick DeVos, who combined the practiced empathy of a pitchman with the entitlement of an heir, spending over $30 million on an unsuccessful run for governor of Michigan in 2006. The Detroit Free Press described him that year as the wealthiest man to seek office in the state\u2019s modern history. Betsy DeVos, who served as chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party for most of the decade between 1996 and 2005, has often played the role of strategist in the relationship. She was a key adviser in her husband\u2019s run for governor and publicly brooded that he had been too gentlemanly in his first debate against the incumbent. \u201cHe\u2019s very good with people, a retail politician who looks you in the eye, shakes your hand, listens to what you say,\u201d said Randy Richardville, a former Republican leader of the Michigan Senate, describing the couple\u2019s strengths. \u201cI would never underestimate Betsy DeVos in a knife fight.\u201d Ms. DeVos has sometimes lacked her husband\u2019s finesse, once famously blaming many of the state\u2019s economic woes on \u201chigh wages.\u201d She has won detractors, by their account, by browbeating legislators into voting her way. \u201cBetsy DeVos was like my 4-year-old granddaughter at the time,\u201d said Mike Pumford, a former Republican state representative who once clashed with her. \u201cThey were both sweet ladies as long as they kept hearing the word \u2018yes.\u2019 They turned into spoiled little brats when they were told \u2018no.\u2019\u201d But Ms. DeVos has often made up for what she lacks in tact through sheer force of will. Mr. Richardville said he and Ms. DeVos disagreed over term limits, which she supported as party chairwoman and he opposed: \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t think you should be setting policy. You should be supporting those of us who do make policy.\u2019 But she never backed down.\u201d While Dick and Betsy DeVos appear to practice a more tolerant form of Christianity than their parents \u2014 Ms. DeVos has spoken out against anti-gay bigotry \u2014 as recently as the early 2000s they funded some groups like Focus on the Family, a large ministry that helps set the political agenda for conservative evangelicals. They have also backed groups that promote conservative values to students and Christian education, including one with ties to the Christian Reformed Church. Their economic views are strikingly similar to the elder Mr. DeVos\u2019s. According to federal disclosures, Amway, which Dick DeVos ran between 1993 and 2002, has lobbied frequently over the last 20 years to reduce or repeal the estate tax. Only the top 0.2 percent wealthiest estates paid the tax in 2015. The company has also opposed crackdowns on tax shelters. Ms. DeVos has been an outspoken defender of unlimited contributions known as soft money, which she described in a 1997 editorial as \u201chard-earned American dollars that Big Brother has yet to find a way to control.\u201d After Congress later passed a major campaign finance reform bill, a nonprofit that Ms. DeVos helped to create and fund masterminded the strategy that produced Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court decision laying the groundwork for super PACs funded by corporations, unions and individuals to raise and spend unlimited amounts in elections. And then there are the family\u2019s efforts to rein in the labor movement. Through their contributions to think tanks like the Mackinac Center, as well as Mr. DeVos\u2019s direct prodding of Republican legislators, the family played a key role in helping pass Michigan\u2019s so-called right-to-work legislation in 2012. The legislation largely ended the requirement that workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment. Unions in the state bled members in 2014, the first full year the measure was in effect. Allies say the DeVoses fight for their beliefs. \u201cBetsy and Dick see themselves as principled conservatives,\u201d said Frederick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIt kind of seems healthy and admirable to give resources to folks who are going to fight for causes you believe in.\u201d But the fights can appear to be as much about consolidating power as ideology. Unions were arguably the family\u2019s most formidable political opponent in Michigan, one of labor\u2019s traditional strongholds. The DeVos family\u2019s roots as education activists date back at least to when Richard DeVos Sr. was running Amway and an institute based at the company\u2019s headquarters trained teachers to inject free-market principles into their curriculum. According to an interview Ms. DeVos gave to Philanthropy magazine, she and her husband became interested in education causes when they began visiting a Christian school that served low-income children in Grand Rapids in the 1980s. \u201cIf we could choose the right school for our kids\u201d \u2014 by which she appeared to mean primarily private schools \u2014 \u201cit only seemed fair that they could do the same for theirs,\u201d she told the magazine. The family spent millions of dollars on a ballot proposal in 2000 asking if Michigan should legalize vouchers, in which students can use taxpayer money to attend private schools. Many critics, like the education historian Diane Ravitch, argue that the point of vouchers is to destroy public education and teachers\u2019 unions. The group Americans United for Separation of Church and State has documented how conservative Christians have long supported vouchers, which could fund religious schools. After voters objected by more than a two-to-one ratio, Dick DeVos gave a speech at the Heritage Foundation saying such efforts would have to shift to state legislatures, where groups backed by deep-pocketed donors could offer \u201ca political consequence for opposition, and political reward for support of education reform issues.\u201d It is not unusual for the wealthy \u2014 who devote nearly 50 percent of their philanthropic dollars to education, according to the group Wealth-X \u2014 to spend aggressively in the political realm to impose their preferred reforms. Even by these standards, however, the DeVoses stand out for the amount of money they spend trying to advance their goals through politics rather than philanthropy, such as research into reforms or subsidizing schools. As Sarah Reckhow, an expert on education philanthropy at Michigan State University, put it: \u201cThe DeVoses are like: \u2018No, we know what we want. We don\u2019t need to have all this window dressing.\u2019\u201d Ms. DeVos has led two nonprofits that have spent millions of dollars electing governors and legislators sympathetic to school vouchers around the country. Matt Frendewey, a spokesman for one of the groups, said the efforts had frequently been bipartisan, and that the amount of money they had spent has been dwarfed by contributions from teachers\u2019 unions opposed to reform. Yet in Michigan, at least, the family\u2019s political strategy has not been subtle. After he defied Ms. DeVos on a key charter school vote, Mr. Pumford, the former Republican legislator, survived an effort by the Great Lakes Education Project, a nonprofit the DeVoses bankrolled, to defeat him in his 2002 primary. But shortly after, the House speaker told him the Education Committee chairmanship he coveted would not be forthcoming. \u201cI said, \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d Mr. Pumford recalled. \u201cHe said: \u2018You know why. The DeVoses will walk away from us.\u2019\u201d Mr. Pumford added: \u201cShe told me that was going to happen.\u201d (Rick Johnson, the House speaker, said he did not recall the conversation but also that he had not promised Mr. Pumford the chairmanship and would not have explained his reasons for withholding it.) Over time, the Great Lakes Education Project helped elect Republican majorities sympathetic to the DeVoses\u2019 agenda. But the DeVoses\u2019 lobbyists and operatives also discovered less messy ways to advance legislation. Late one night of their last workweek in 2015, the Michigan House and Senate were about to approve some uncontroversial changes to campaign finance law, when the bill abruptly grew by more than 40 pages. After the legislators discovered what they had voted for, many said they were horrified. Tucked away in the new pages was a provision that would have made it much harder for local bodies like school boards to raise money through property tax increases. \u201cMichigan schools will likely suffer the brunt of the impact because the vast majority rely on periodic voter approval of local operating levy renewals for property taxes,\u201d the ratings agency Moody\u2019s wrote of the measure the following month. \u201cI was fooled into voting for something I opposed,\u201d said Dave Pagel, a Republican representative. \u201cI consider it the worst vote I\u2019ve made.\u201d The chief culprits, according to Mr. Pagel and others at the state Capitol when the bill passed, were lobbyists closely tied to the DeVoses. Tony Daunt, a spokesman for the Michigan Freedom Fund, a nonprofit headed by the DeVoses\u2019 longtime political aide, and whose political spending arm they have funded generously, said the group was \u201cpart of the discussion process with people in the legislature\u201d about the proposal and \u201chad consistently expressed support for the policy.\u201d The law was later blocked by a federal judge, but the group has vowed to try again. Ms. DeVos\u2019s advocates see in these fights the toughness to take on entrenched opponents of expanding reforms like charter schools and vouchers. In promoting Ms. DeVos in The Washington Post, Mitt Romney, the Republican Party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, emphasized that her wealth gave her the independence to be \u201csomeone who isn\u2019t financially biased shaping education.\u201d He added, \u201cDeVos doesn\u2019t need the job now, nor will she be looking for an education job later.\u201d But critics see someone with an unmistakable agenda. \u201cThe signs are there that she will do something radical,\u201d said Jack Jennings, a former general counsel for the House education committee. \u201cTrump wouldn\u2019t have appointed this woman for this position if he didn\u2019t intend something radical.\u201d",

        "subtitle": "Hillary Clinton Questioned By Whitewater ProsecutorsBy James BennetPRINT EDITIONApril 26, 1998, Page 1022",
        "author": "James Bennet",
        "date": "April 26, 1998",
        "content": " Hillary Rodham Clinton was questioned today at the White House for almost five hours about her legal work for a failed Arkansas savings and loan by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, and other prosecutors from his office, Administration officials said. The session, the sixth time Mrs. Clinton has given sworn testimony about the Whitewater land deal, was videotaped to be shown to a Federal grand jury in Arkansas. That grand jury is scheduled to disband on May 7 after spending 30 months examining Whitewater and a thicket of related matters, including the failure of Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan owned by the Clintons' Whitewater partners. In a terse statement released this evening, Charles F. C. Ruff, the White House counsel, said of the interview: ''The subjects generally were matters concerning the Rose Law Firm's legal representation of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan and Mrs. Clinton's relationship with related individuals.'' As a partner in the Rose firm, Mrs. Clinton performed work for Madison. In contrast to previous statements issued by the White House after Mrs. Clinton provided testimony to Mr. Starr, the statement today did not say she was ''cooperating fully'' with the investigation. But White House officials said the fact that Mrs. Clinton agreed to the meeting was evidence of the Clintons' cooperation. Today's questioning, in the Yellow Room of the White House, took place in an even more politically charged atmosphere than previous sessions. Since accusations surfaced that President Clinton had a sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, a former intern at the White House, and tried to cover it up, Mrs. Clinton has assailed Mr. Starr as a politically motivated prosecutor linked to right-wing enemies of the President. A separate Federal grand jury here is looking into the charges related to Ms. Lewinsky. Today's questioning was conducted by Mr. Starr along with a deputy, W. Hickman Ewing Jr., and three other prosecutors. President Clinton, who went golfing today, did not attend. Appearing with Mrs. Clinton were Mr. Ruff and Cheryl Mills, a deputy, along with David E. Kendall, the Clintons' private lawyer, and an associate, Nicole Seligman. Like all such grand jury testimony, Mrs. Clinton's testimony today was kept secret. Mrs. Clinton finished her testimony less than two hours before she and the President were to attend the annual dinner here of the White House Correspondents Association. Although such dinners are intended to be relaxed and entertaining, the jokes have sometimes been barbed during Mr. Clinton's tenure. Tonight, the President dined in the same ballroom with Paula Corbin Jones, who has accused him of sexual misconduct. But the humor was resolutely nonpolitical, and Mrs. Clinton received a standing ovation from the crowd, which was well aware of her testimony today. In his remarks, Mr. Clinton never referred to Mr. Starr, but he repeatedly drew laughs from the crowd as he discussed the rituals of Washington as if it were a foreign country. ''This Washington is a very special place, and Hillary and I will never forget our visit here,'' he said. Mr. Starr has sent no signals that the Little Rock grand jury will produce new indictments by May 7. Under the independent counsel law, he is required to submit a final report to the special court that supervises him, although such a report would almost certainly not become public for many months. If Mr. Starr determines that Mr. Clinton may have committed an impeachable offense, he must outline the evidence to Congress. Mr. Starr's prosecutors have been looking into whether the Clintons tried to obscure their involvement in Whitewater and its link to Madison Guaranty, which failed at a cost to taxpayers of over $60 million. As part of that investigation, the prosecutors have been examining the legal work Mrs. Clinton did for Madison and related land deals, including a project known as Castle Grande. Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have told the Little Rock grand jury in recent months that a document drafted by Mrs. Clinton in 1986 was used ''to deceive regulators'' about the financing of Castle Grande. The officials had originally concluded that Mrs. Clinton did little work for Madison or Castle Grande. But they changed their view after seeing her billing records, which disappeared for several years before turning up in the White House residence in 1996. Mrs. Clinton has said she does not remember drafting the document or performing other work on Castle Grande. Such Saturday encounters with prosecutors over Whitewater and related matters have become somewhat familiar at the White House. This was the fourth time that Mrs. Clinton provided testimony under oath there to Mr. Starr, and Mr. Clinton has also been interviewed several times. Mrs. Clinton also testified in January 1996 before a Washington grand jury. And both Clintons were questioned once under oath at the White House -- on a Sunday in June 1994 -- by Robert B. Fiske Jr., Mr. Starr's predecessor as independent counsel. White House aides were furious with Mr. Starr for compelling Mrs. Clinton to appear before the Washington grand jury. But their criticism of him reached new levels after it was disclosed that he was pursuing the accusations regarding Ms. Lewinsky. In a television interview on Jan. 27, Mrs. Clinton called Mr. Starr ''a politically motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right-wing opponents of my husband.'' She accused Mr. Starr and his office of ''scratching for dirt, intimidating witnesses, doing everything possible to try to make some accusation against my husband.'' Today's session was negotiated in secret over several weeks, with even members of the White House counsel's office left in the dark about Mrs. Clinton's appointment with Mr. Starr. Mrs. Clinton's most recent interview with Mr. Starr was on Jan. 14, days before Mr. Starr's investigation was expanded to include the charges regarding Ms. Lewinsky.",

        "subtitle": "ICE is not the SS or the Gestapo. But it has concerning similarities.",
        "author": "Jason Stanley",
        "date": "July 4, 2019",
        "content": " On July 2, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, after a visit to migrant detention facilities run by Customs and Border Protection in Texas, claimed that the United States is \u201cheaded toward fascism.\u201d Much of the response that followed was expected, but little or none of it examined the statement closely or detailed to what degree the United States\u2019 immigration policy justifies such comparisons. So how apt is this analogy between the current situation and early years of fascist regimes? Liberal democracy organizes society around respect for the dignity, equality and freedom of all human beings. Fascism, by contrast, organizes society around the vilification of outsiders. In this administration\u2019s rhetoric toward undocumented immigrants from Central America and religious minorities, we have been subject to classic fascist tropes for some time. The obsessive focus on immigration and the representation of immigrants as invaders is particularly indicative of this ideology. In the 1930s, Oswald Mosley, the head of the British Union of Fascists, ran on a platform of ending immigration entirely. \u201cBritain for the British\u201d was its motto. Comparisons to the Nazi regime, one of which Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made last month when she called American detention facilities \u201cconcentration camps,\u201d are also routinely met with outrage. But Hitler, too, was obsessed with immigration. In \u201cMein Kampf\u201d he praised the \u201cnational State,\u201d and he saw foreign immigration as the obstacle. He wrote of America\u2019s anti-immigration policies as a model for a nationalistic Germany: The current American administration clearly does not share the toxic and murderous ideology of Nazism, nor its anti-Semitism, but when the president of the United States derides immigrants from \u201cshithole countries\u201d while pleading for more immigrants from Northern Europe, he echoes the very aspects of American history that Hitler praised. When we consider the character of a ruling government, we should think about the ideology that motivates it, as well as the institutions and tactics it employs to transform society. It is clear that this administration draws on fascist ideology in its rhetoric. But what about its institutions and tactics? On June 17, President Trump tweeted that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would deport millions of \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d He\u2019s not the first president to focus on undocumented immigrants for removal. Every president since the Sept. 11 attacks, including Barack Obama, has, too. But the Obama administration explicitly prioritized terrorists and serious criminal offenders. The Trump administration is the first in recent memory to target undocumented families for removal in planned mass deportation raids. Trump\u2019s announcement about mass deportations conveyed the kind of cruelty toward outsiders that he often uses to excite his base. It was only a matter of time before such rhetoric would begin to transform our institutions. ICE is a novel American institution \u2014 it was created in 2003 by the Homeland Security Act in the wake of Sept. 11, at a time when rights and liberties took a back seat to concerns about safety. The same act created the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, tasked with policing the border and staffing migrant detention centers. In ICE, we have a special force, created in an anti-democratic moment in American history, authorized with police-like power and directed at political outsiders inside our borders. The institution itself is tied politically to the country\u2019s leader. Trump is the first president endorsed by a major union representing ICE\u2019s employees, and Trump has repeatedly represented himself as its chief defender. ICE is an organization that is like the police but is not the police. The job of the police in a democratic society is to keep communities safe. In practice, ICE collaborates with conventional American criminal justice institutions, including local police departments, but often end up working at cross-purposes with them by creating fear in immigrant communities, whose members become less likely to report crime. As a result, some police chiefs have aligned themselves recently against ICE raids. The goal of ICE is not to make communities safer. ICE\u2019s mission is to reinforce a distinction between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d The Trump administration has advanced its more aggressive policies of enforcement by characterizing undocumented immigrants as a group of criminals, rather than as individuals. In 2017, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly ordered ICE to portray immigrants in general as intrinsically prone to crime to justify mass arrests by highlighting \u201cthree egregious cases\u201d to use in the media. This tactic of identifying whole groups as criminal has a shameful history. In my grandmother\u2019s 1957 memoir of 1930s Berlin, she reports similar tactics by the Gestapo in 1937, who spoke of \u201ccriminal\u201d Jews while arresting Jewish citizens who had committed minor traffic violations. To be sure, no organizations precisely like the Nazi SS or the SA or Italy\u2019s fascist Blackshirts operate in the United States today. There is no organization empowered to make arrests that originated as a paramilitary force, or that has an official racist ideology, or that is used to overtly target political opponents. ICE is not the SS or the Gestapo. But it has concerning similarities, including its symbiotic relationship with an increasingly authoritarian president. And it is not the only institution with disturbing fascist elements; evidence of extreme racism and sexism has emerged among members of its sister organization, Customs and Border Protection. The special circumstances under which ICE was created and now operates also lends credence to the argument that ICE is expendable, a nonessential and arguably harmful arm of government that could be eliminated. What about the private detention centers for undocumented immigrants, which Ms. Ocasio-Cortez described last month as concentration camps? After the comparison, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum issued a news release denouncing comparisons to the Holocaust. In response, hundreds of historians and other academics working on the Holocaust and genocide responded with a letter defending the importance of these analogies. As Kica Matos at the Vera Institute of Justice explained to me, journalists are barred from visiting these centers; they are open only to legal representatives and members of Congress. In early June, the Trump administration canceled educational, recreational and legal aid for migrant children in detention centers, sealing them off further from public view. Reports of the extreme conditions in these centers have flooded the news in recent weeks. These reports have been provided by legal representatives empowered to visit them. What happens now, as Ms. Matos asked,  that funding is cut off for such visits? Even as we are shut off from facts, immigrants will hear the stories from one another. The strategy here is to encourage them to self-deport. This, too, is familiar from history. In the November 1938 pogrom of German Jews, more than 30,000 of them were rounded up and sent to concentration camps, where they were subjected to brutal and inhumane conditions and soon released. In \u201cKL: A History of the Nazi Concentration Camps,\u201d Nikolaus Wachsmann, a professor of European history at the University of London, explains that the release of these prisoners made sense from the regime\u2019s perspective, because \u201cthe camps had served their function \u2014 forcing many Jews out of Germany.\u201d The regime\u2019s harsh anti-Semitic rhetoric, followed by exposure of its Jewish citizens to the brutality of its camps, led to a large exodus of Jews from Germany (including my grandmother and my father in July 1939). The tactic worked. Should we therefore employ it? There is an economic reality to this situation as well. We increasingly see connections between powerful business interests and the institutions of state terror. Wall Street gives billions in loans to facilitate the profits of companies who run detention centers; large companies make profits by selling their wares to them, and former high ranking administration officials serve on their boards. On the local level, county jails enjoy newfound profits by housing those detained by ICE\u2019s massively broadened mandate. A refusal to discuss fascism in the current political context in the United States obscures both the nature of fascism, representing it as an all-or-nothing matter, as well as our own troubling past. The extent to which a society is liberal democratic or fascist can be measured on a continuum. In the struggles with our racist history \u2014 against black Americans, Native Americans and immigration from non-Northern European countries \u2014 the United States has always had aspects of both. With the development of a police-like force directed specifically to force outsiders into hiding, detention centers sealed off from public view in which to detain them and an economy set up to profit from it all, we move in the wrong direction.",
